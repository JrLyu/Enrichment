# Data Types and Structures

## Data Types

> **Observer bias/Experimenter bias**: The tendency for different people to observe things differently.
> 

> **Interpretation bias**: The tendency to interpret ambiguous situations in a positive or negative way.
> 

> **Sampling bias**: Over-representing or under-representing certain members of a population as a result of working with a sample that is not representative of the population as a whole.
> 

> **Population**: In data analytics, all possible data values in a dataset.
> 

> **Sample**: In data analytics, a segment of a population that is representative of the entire population.
> 

> **Unbiased sampling**: When the sample of the population being measured is representative of the population as a whole.

## Data Privacy and Data Ethics

> **Data privacy**: Preserving a data subject’s information any time a data transaction occurs.
> 

> **Data ethics**: Well-founded standards of right and wrong that dictate how data is collected, shared, and used.
> 

> **Ethics**: Well-founded standards of right and wrong that prescribe what humans ought to do, usually in terms of rights, obligations, benefits to society, fairness, or specific virtues.

> 

> **Openness**: The aspect of data ethics that promotes the free access, usage, and sharing of data.
> 

> **Ownership**: The aspect of data ethics that presumes individuals own the raw data they provide and have primary control over its usage, processing ,and sharing.
> 

> **Transaction transparency**: The aspect of data ethics that presumes all data-processing activities and algorithms should be explainable and understood by the individual who provides the data.
> 

> **Data anonymization**: The process of protecting people’s private or sensitive data by eliminating identifying information.
> 

> **Data governance**: A process for ensuring the formal management of a company’s data assets.
> 

> **Data interoperability**: The ability to integrate data from multiple sources and a key factor in the successful use of open data among companies and governments.
> 

# Forms of Data

## Data in a spreadsheet

> **Long data**: A dataset in which each row is one time point per subject, so each subject has data in multiple rows.
> 

> **Wide data**: A dataset in which every data subject has a single row with multiple columns to hold the values of various attributes of the subject.
> 

## Metadata

> **Metadata**: Data about data; in database management, it helps data analysts interpret the contents of the data within a database.
> 

> **Metadata repository**: A database created to store metadata.
> 

### Different Types of Metadata

> **Administrative metadata**: Metadata that indicates the technical source of a digital asset.
> 

> **Descriptive metadata**: Metadata that describes a piece of data and can be sued to identify it at a later point in time.
> 

> **Normalized database**: A database in which only related data is stored in each table.
> 

> **Relational database**: A database that contains a series of tables that can be connected to form relationships.
> 
> 
> > **Foreign key**: A field within a database table that is a primary key in another table.
> > 
> 
> > **Primary key**: An identifier in a database that references a column in which each value is unique.
> > 

> **Structural metadata**: Metadata that indicates how a piece of data is organized and whether it is part of one or more than one data collection.
> 

### Concepts Relating to Metadata

> **Redundancy**: When the same piece of data is stored in two or more places.
> 

> **Reframing**: The process of restating a problem or challenge, then redirecting it toward a potential resolution.
> 

### Working with Metadata - SQL

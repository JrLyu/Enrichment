> **Data composition**: The process of combining the individual parts in a visualization and displaying them together as a whole.
> 

## Types of Data Visualization

> **Dynamic visualization**: Data visualizations that are interactive or change over time.  ****
> 

> **Static visualization**: A data visualization that does not change over time unless it is edited.
> 

> **Histogram**: A data visualization that shows how often data values fall into certain ranges.
> 

> **Bar graph**: A data visualization that uses size to contrast and compare two or more values.
> 

> **Distribution graph**: A data visualization that displays the frequency of various outcomes in a sample.
> 

> **Bullet graph**: A data visualization that displays data as a horizontal bar chart moving toward a desired value.
> 

> **Line graph**: A data visualization that uses one or more lines to display shifts or changes in data over time.
> 

> **Scatter plot**: A data visualization that represents relationships between different variables with individual data points without a connecting line.
> 

> **Box plot**: A data visualization that displays the distribution of values along an x-axis.
> 

> **Chart**: A graphical representation of data from a worksheet.
> 

> **Pie chart**: A data visualization that uses segments of a circle to represent the proportions of each data category compared to the whole.
> 

> **Area chart**: A data visualization that uses individual data points for a changing variable connected by a continuous line with a filled in area underneath.
> 

> **Bubble chart**: A data visualization that displays individual data points as bubbles, comparing numeric values by their relative size.
> 

> **Column chart**: A data visualization that uses individual data points for a changing variable, represented as vertical columns.
> 

> **Combo chart**: A data visualization that combines more than one visualization type.
> 

> **Donut chart**: A data visualization where segments of a ring represent data values adding up to a whole.
> 

> **Gantt chart**: A data visualization that displays the duration of events or activities on a timeline.
> 

> **Gauge chart**: A data visualization that shows a single result within a progressive range of values.
> 

> **Packed bubble chart**: A data visualization that displays data in clustered circles.
> 

> **Map**: A data visualization that organizes data geographically.
> 

> **Heat map**: A data visualization that uses color contrast to compare categories in a dataset.
> 

> **Density map**: A data visualization that represents concentrations, with color representing the number or frequency of data points in a given area on a map.
> 

> **Filled map**: A data visualization that colors areas in a map based on measurements or dimensions.
> 

> **Symbol map**: A data visualization that displays a marker over a given longitude and latitude.
> 

> **Decision tree**: A tool that helps analysts make decisions about critical features of a visualization.
> 

> **Circle view**: A data visualization that shows comparative strength in data.
> 

> **Highlight table**: A data visualization that uses conditional formatting and color on a table.
> 

## Understanding Data Visualization

> **Headline**: Text at the top of a visualization that communicates the data being presented.
> 

> **Subtitle**: Text that supports a headline by adding context and description.
> 

> **Label**: Text in a visualization that identifies a value or describes a scale.
> 

> **Legend**: A tool that identifies the meaning of various elements in a data visualization.
> 

> **X-axis**: The horizontal line of a graph usually placed at the bottom, which is often used to represent time scales and discrete categories.
> 

> **Y-axis**: The vertical line of a graph usually placed to the left, which is often used to represent frequencies and other numerical variables.
> 

> **Alternative text**: Text that provides an alternative to non-text content, such as images and videos.
> 

> **Annotation**: Text that briefly explains data or helps focus the audience on a particular aspect of the data in a visualization.
> 

## Design Data Visualization

> **Design thinking**: A process used to solve complex problems in a user-centric way.
> 

### The Design Principles

> **Balance**: The design principle of creating aesthetic appeal and clarity in a data visualization by evenly distributing visual elements.
> 

> **Emphasis**: The design principle of arranging visual elements to focus the audience’s attention on important information in a data visualization.
> 

> **Movement**: The design principle of arranging visual elements to guide the audience’s eyes from one part of a data visualization to another.
> 

> **Pattern**: The design principle of using similar visual elements to demonstrate trends and relationships in a data visualization.
> 

> **Proportion**: The design principle of suing the relative size and arrangement of visual elements.
> 

> **Rhythm**: The design principle of creating movement and flow in a data visualization to engage an audience.
> 

> **Unity**: The design principle of using visual elements that complement each other to create.
> 

> **Variety**: The design principle of using different kinds of visual elements in a data visualization to engage an audience.
> 

### Visual Forms in Data Visualization

> **Visual form**: The appearance of a data visualization that gives it structure and aesthetic appeal.
> 

> **Channel**: A visual aspect or variable that represents characteristics of the data in a visualization.
> 

> **Cluster**: A collection of data points on a data visualization with similar values.
> 

> **Mark**: A visual object in a data visualization such as a point, line, or shape.
> 

> **Pre-attentive attributes**: The elements of data visualization that an audience recognizes automatically without conscious effort.
> 

> **Diverging color palette**: A color theme that displays two ranges of data values using two different hues, with color intensity representing the magnitude of the values.
> 

## Ways for Data Visualization

> **R**: A programming language used for statistical analysis, visualization, and other data analysis.
> 

> **Tableau**: A business intelligence and analytics platform that helps people visualize, understand, and make decisions with data.
> 

> **Data blending**: A tableau method that combines data from multiple data sources.
>

Alice was a beautiful princess. Betsy was a wicked witch.
Alice had 10 expensive dresses, whereas Betsy had only 5.
Because of envy, Betsy cast a spell on Alice,
yelling these arcane magical words: "Eaaa yeeb siid! EAAA YEEB SIID!".
Suddenly, Alice's 10 dresses turned into rugs. Alice became very unhappy.
Seeing that Alice was unhappy, Betsy realized she was wrong, and reversed the spell.
Alice and Betsy became friends, and they lived happily ever after.

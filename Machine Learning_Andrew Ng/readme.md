This is my notes of the Machine Learning Specailization. 

# Machine Learning

> **Machine Learning**: A field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. ~ Arthur Samuel (1959)
> 

If the machine is allowed to learn with more attempts/time, the results of machine learning will become better. 

# Categories of Machine Learning

## Supervised Machine Learning

> In **Supervised Learning**, the machine learns from data labeled with the “right answers.”
> 

 The inputs are known as $x$, and the right answers are $y$*.*

***Examples***: spam filtering, speech recognition, machine translation, online advertising, self-driving car, visual inspection, etc. 

### Regression

> **Regression** predicts a number - infinitely many possible outputs.
> 

***Examples***: Housing price prediction

### Classification

> **Classification** predicts categories - small number of possible outputs.
> 

***Examples***: Breast cancer detection

## Unsupervised Machine Learning

> In **Unsupervised Learning**, the machine finds something interesting in unlabeled data.
> 

### Types of Unsupervised Learning

> **Clustering**: Group similar data points together.
> 

***Examples***: Google news, DNA microarray, Grouping customers

> **Dimensionality reduction**: Compress data using fewer numbers.
> 

> **Anomaly detection**: Find unusual data points.
> 

## Other types of Machine Learning:

- Recommender systems
- Reinforcement Learning

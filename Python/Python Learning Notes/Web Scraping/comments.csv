"Introducing my daughter to investing

My daughter has a bank account that we opened for her back when she was born. It has about $2,000 in it and she’s dying to take it out to spend on stupid things she doesn’t need. We keep having the same argument about how it’s her money and she should be able to do whatever she wants with it, but obviously we aren’t going to budge here. We started talking to her about investing it and having it earn more money for her without her having to do anything. It was a successful tactic. She’s very into this idea.. only problem is my husband and I have no idea where to start. Where is the best place to open an account for her? What should we be looking for? I thought it might be fun for her to buy some stocks in companies she know about but I know ETFs are the better option. If this were your daughter… what would you do?",3

"You can look for yourself and see the long term trends in housing affordability here*. 

Right now the house price to income ratio is ~7 in the US and ~8 in the UK. That's quite high relative to 1960s to 1990s numbers when the ratio was around 4 for the US and about 5 for the UK. This doesn't include interest rates and most of the time in the 60s through 90s time the interest was higher than it is today, sometimes by quite a lot. 

Right now the yield curve is inverted so the bond market thinks that the good place for 30 year rates is ~4.8% which is pricing in a rate cut by the Fed to ~4.5% at some point. There are other here that know more about yields and bonds than I do but we kinda need a 'normal' rate to continue the conversation. If Fed rates in the second quarter of the century are around 4.5% then they are a good amount lower than the end half of the 20th century so you would expect house prices to be higher. Maybe a decent guess is a 6x income from the rate talked about previously. So that 560k house (about average right now) right now should, over time, come down to 490k in 2023 dollars. This all said predicting the housing market for the next 30 years is very hard if not impossible. 

The take away message that I would state is: the housing prices of today aren't nearly as out of step as some think they are. The deltas that we are talking about in the aforementioned ratio are between 4 and 7, with 7 being more likely as interest rates get lower (this also doesn't include that average home size is a lot larger). Saving up for a down payment (generally the hardest part of house ownership) isn't that different if the multiple on average income of 5, 6, or 7. For a 20% down payment this would mean saving 84k, 98k, or 112k respectively at todays income levels. If saving 112k is impossible for you then saving 84k is also probably not possible.

If you want to live in an area where it's highly competitive and everyone wants to live in then no that will never change. Other areas where there isn't a bidding war should get easier to buy once the rates come down in a few years.,4
"People underestimate how much money is on the sidelines in these competitive areas. I live in the Bay Area suburbs and during the covid boom, 
home prices almost doubled in a matter of 2 years, yet homes were selling in a day for 10% over asking, sometimes in all cash.

Example a 2000sq ft home previously worth 1M in 2020 would get listed for 1.8M in 2021 and sell in a day for 2M.

I thought maybe the massive tech layoffs and 7-8% interest rates would lower prices here, but houses are still selling for the same prices they peaked at 2 years ago at 2-3% rates, but they might just sit on the market for couple weeks now. In terms of mortgage that means people are willing to pay 3x what they would’ve paid 2 years ago. It’s crazy. 

I imagine once interest rates lower and the economy improves we’ll see prices going even higher and houses selling even faster.",4

"This is called a carry trade and it isn’t an arbitrage because you have currency risk. If you tried to hedge out your currency risk by trading, for example, a USD/JPY currency swap or forward you will find this interest rate differential is already priced in, removing any chance of arbitrage.",7
"FX volatility will swamp any interest rate arbitrage over time. Because mortgages are consumer facing, politics will get involved. Poland is a good example of this.   
 Years ago, lenders in Poland issued 100's of thousands of Swiss Franc mortgages because of the rate differences versus Polish Zloty rates. As the Zloty devalued 33% against Franc over the last 10 years, borrower defaults were huge as their outlays far exceeded what they had expected. European courts have stepped in and ruled the mortgages have unfair terms to the borrowers. Lenders are writing off billions of dollars.",7
"Screwing around with residential mortgages isn't necessary.  

But the first thing to understand is covered interest rate parity.   If you want to eliminate currency risk, you could use forward contracts to lock in the future exchange rate.  Eg borrow yen.  Convert to USD.  Buy treasuries (this is the part where you don't need ti even mess with mortgages but the same ideas will hold). Enter forward contract to turn needed USD back to yen to pay off the borrowing.  So is this free money?  The answer is .... no.  This opportunity is arbitraged away.  The forward contract on the yen--USD trades at the price such that the interest rate differential is wiped out.  Basically the forward market is pricing in an appreciation of the yen and depreciation of Colombian pesos. 

Now where things do get interesting: is that forward rate actually a good predictor of what the future exchange rate will be?  And the evidence here is sort of - directionally yes but betting that the moves will be less significant than predicted (that is borrowing low interest rate and investing higher and NOT hedging), at least in major currencies, has likely generated a profit.  Note these profits aren't normal distributions- more small wins and big losses.  Still it has paid off more often then not.  This trade is called the carry trade, and it's big, and levered.",7
"One other thing to add: even if you ignore the cost of hedging, there's no need to get into the business of retail lending/loan servicing (which is complex and expensive, particularly for secured debt like a mortgage) in order to run a carry trade. You can just buy bonds denominated in the local currency.

Borrow Yen, convert to Dollars, buy US agency mortgage bonds. Voila. You're funding mortgages via carry trade. (When you actually try to do this, one of the first things you'll find is that your rate for borrowing Yen is significantly higher than the rate for a mortgage in Japan, unless -- maybe -- you're a huge operator with a good credit rating.)",7
Also no need for a “VC back tech company” to do regular bank stuff.,7
"My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11ezwar/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_march/jah0b73/) was 6 months ago.

To recap, a brief overview of my strategy, that has not since changed:

> I am 26, so I have several decades until retirement. My goal is to hold the stocks in my portfolio perpetually, though I'm not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a) I see an opportunity to take profits b) my thesis changes. My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much.

> I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued.

> I like stocks that are quality companies with:

> -	A sustainable business model - high cash flow generation, high ROIC / ROCE, good balance sheet. Bonus points for recurring, diversified revenue, and optionality.
> -	Business model and products I understand, or at least understand their value. I don't think I'll ever understand ASML's machines, but I understand why it's one of a kind company.
> -	A wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.
> -	High margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.
> -	Sustainable buybacks and dividend growth.
> -	Great management.

I made some changes to my portfolio:

- I no longer own the CARB carbon allowance ETF. It was good for some hedging but I wanted to simplify my approach a bit.
- I no longer own small cap and EM ETFs. I only have MSCI World ETF (15%) and MSCI World Quality ETF (10%). I wanted to intensify my focus on quality companies and simplify my approach.

- I sold BN & BAM, UNP, LMT, ADBE, JNJ. I was no longer comfortable with Brookfield's structure and my lack of understanding it, so I sold all my Brookfield holdings after almost 4 years I've held them. ADBE had really nice growth and I felt better taking the profits. I like that they will probably adapt to generative AI pretty well. I love the company and might buy back later. UNP, LMT, JNJ are all good but I think I wanted to focus on more innovative (less so with LMT) and consumer oriented businesses (less so with JNJ).

- I bought LVMH, LLY, PM, IDXX, ZTS, L'oreal, META. I briefly held EL which I sold (at loss) and bought L'oreal instead.

- I increased the weights of my core holdings. 6 of my stocks (MSFT, AAPL, ASML, V, MA, NVO) account for >50% of my stocks, 9 (+ LVMH, GOOG, COST) account for 50% of my overall portfolio.

| **Idexx Laboratories**          | IDXX   |   5,1% |   1,4% |          2,5% |

I view all of these as great companies with a history of compounding and a great future driven by secular trends. I think the themes of my portfolio are pretty clear:

- Big tech with massive cash flows and wide moat (AAPL, MSFT, ASML, GOOG, META). I was hesitant about buying Meta, but the numbers are so good. The semiconductor business is too complicated for my liking, so I tend to avoid those companies (I briefly owned AMD and NVDA a few years ago). ASML is even more complicated, but that's part of the monopoly and it seems like they are decades ahead of any competition, especially with protectionist policies from the US and EU. NVDA matches a lot of what I look for in the company, but I think there is and will be too much volatility, so I'm not buying it.

- Toll booth companies for a world with growing cashless payments (MA, V). Some of the greatest businesses in the world. Not much more to say. There might be competition in the future, but their scale gives them so many advantages.

- Aging society, obesity, diabetes (NVO, LLY, ISRG). NVO and LLY are probably the two best pharma companies in the world. They might seem overvalued, but once you look into the companies, you realize they really are that great. NVO and LLY now also pretty much make miracle drugs with an ever increasing number of patients. Even without Wegovy / Ozempic / Mounjaro they have amazing numbers. Now they'll have walking happy advertisements walking around. The benefits of the drugs clearly outsize the side effects, so once it becomes accessible, it will be great business.

- Quality retail / consumer stocks with loyal customers, good business models, high market share (LVMH, COST, HD, ULTA).

- Luxury, beauty, cosmetics (LVMH, ULTA, L'oreal). LVMH is an incredibly well managed conglomerate, probably one of the greatest in the world. There are companies that are centuries old and it's unbelievable how huge they made the luxury market. I recommend the [Acquired podcast episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7lMY1C8AMFinpVMTgAH9D9) about the company. ULTA has incredible customer loyalty and growth. I'm curious if they can expand internationally sometime later. L'Oreal is similarly a giant conglomerate. I at first went with Estee Lauder, but it seems like the next few years will be volatile. I believe EL will be very strong in the future, but I don't want to risk the short term volatility. L'Oreal is very similar and the entire beauty industry is very hard to penetrate because these two companies and a few other have consolidated so much of the market and they will buy out any potentially large competitor. I can't see it ever changing. I can't imagine a future where this trend of skincare, beauty is ever reversed, and it only stands to grow as these generations grow older and healthspans grow longer all around the world. I am sure ULTA and Sephora (within LVMH) benefit from this as well.

- A growing market of pet owners who grow ever closer to their companions (ZTS, IDXX). It's crazy how close millenials and gen Z are to their pets. They are part of family. They are already willing to spend so much on their pets at the expense of their own comfort. As their pets grow older, they will be even closer and they will need to spend a lot on their care. IDEXX has the benefit that diagnostics is much more important with pets as they cannot communicate their symptoms.

- Not really a theme, but for some nice dividends I got a nicotine holding, I went with PM. This is one I've hesitated about a lot. I'm not going to write a whole analysis, since it's such a small holding, but I don't see our society ever leaving nicotine and I expect we will see a huge continuing growth in smokeless nicotine products. This might sound contrarian, but I wouldn't be surprised if nicotine was much more normalized in the future (in decades time) as a supplement similar to caffeine. The winners will almost certainly be big tobacco companies as it is and likely will remain a highly regulated market with high entry barriers. Even if that doesn't happen, I think there is still money to be made in cigarettes, as even though the number of smokers decreases in most of the world, the revenue is not dropping yet. And I think there is a generation of nicotine addicts growing up in most of the world due to flavored vapes and nicotine pouches.",8

I know it's a temporary thing, cuz Monday the markets will go down and I'll be sub 20k (psychological thing)",14
"My victory is that I got a part-time job paying $26 an hour on an ambulance with unlimited hours. 

My next step is to sell my car and get into a cheaper one. I own a Japanese luxury vehicle that takes premium gas and costs me $230 in insurance every month. I’m 23 in a HCOL state. 

Hoping to sell it. It has $14k left on the loan and CarVana will only give me 10k. Best option I would think is Facebook marketplace? I’m thinking I can get 16k in private sale. It’s a great car with no problems, I just need to get a Corolla because it’s the responsible thing to do.",14
"I changed positions a month ago and now I'm not working such stressful hours anymore. My pay is less than what I was making on my old schedule, but spending is down an entire 437% over the last month.

By reducing my hours, I can finally cook instead of buying tasteless sandwiches from my work's cafe, I have time to actually brew coffee instead of buying energy drinks/cafe coffees, and I stopped taking vitamins and supplements for the nutrient deficiencies I developed.

I was scared to make the change and reduce my pay, but with the amount I'm saving, it's worth it.",14
"Friends, what's better, the market fund or the hysa?

If Fidelity's SPAXX (core position FZFXX) is yielding 4.99%, why would you keep this money in a HYSA? They're both subject to taxes. Help me understand where I should park my free cash.",14
HYSAs with companies like Betterment and SoFi… seems too good to be true… are they FDIC insured? What’s the exposure? What am I missing?,14
"It probably was, but if no premiums have been paid in recent years, the policy pays the premium from its accumulated wealth.

Also, his premium might have been extremely low.",15
"Yes, but I don't think you want to go that route.

This is why life insurance is typically not a good investment. You only really make money if you die.",15
"Yes, $1,000 policies were a thing - older policies were less. The average cost of a funeral in the 50s was near $800. 

The premium payments would have been equally small. Overtime the policy would have built cash value and received dividends to grow the internal value. The death benefit is certainly higher than $6,500. 

That internal value could have been reduced by missed payments and policy loans. 

No one can say if it was a bad investment without an idea of the total premiums paid or policy loan history. For a quick illustration, $500 invested in 1950 earning 4%, would be worth $8,258 this year. It’s unlikely your grandfather paid $500 into this policy until well into the life of the policy. 

If you really want to know the ROI on the policy then ask NYL for the cost basis. You probably want to know that before surrendering because $6500-cost basis is the taxable gain (the owner will get a 1099).",15
It was likely less than $25/year.,15
"It’s not an investment. It’s insurance. It’s not to make money. It’s to make sure if you die your family isn’t screwed. 

Pay the house off, take some time off, grieve, heal, move forward.",15
"They want to be able to convince you to buy more stuff when you sit down with the finance person.  Paint protection.  Extra warranty.  Blinker fluid.  etc... etc...

> I'm 5 hours away from home fighting with the dealership over unexpected fees.

To address this, make sure you have an OTD (out the door) price *in writing*.  This is how to better assure you avoid your concern.",16
"If a car salesman literally said, ""bring a blank check"" I wouldn't do it. I've never heard of a salesman being that upfront about his intentions to rip you off.",16
"Don’t pay ahead of time. Give all necessary info to get a final price, as an invoice in writing. Take the cash and get cashiers check from bank for exactly the amount. You don’t want to travel with large amounts of cash. While totally legal, you expose your cash to theft and asset forfeiture. 

Did this a while back when make and model of car I wanted was out of state at dealership near an airport with direct flight. Dealership even picked me up at airport.

At dealership, you will be up sold on all sorts of options. Politely decline, ask for documents/brochures of the extended warranty or what ever else they will try to sell to take home, that’s the easiest way to I’ve found to exit quickly. Unfortunately, even with all that it will take an while.",16
"The dealer is salivating on the prospect of the sunk cost OP.  Years waiting,  flight up and no transportation home.",16
This! I’d say you’re shipping it and you need an invoice. Pay that then go pick it up yourself. That way you don’t even have to talk to anyone. Done it a few times on used cars.,16
"I had a similar issue with my kitchen sink. Landlord said they won’t pay if it’s a user problem. In the end it wasn’t, it was years of build up and needed professional help. I sorted out the plumber and keep the landlord in the loop. They paid for everything when I sent them the invoice. Maybe talk to the landlord about it? Granted, I live in the UK and my landlord is reasonable",17
"Don’t know where you are, but my lease said the same thing yet state law overrode it. The landlord is usually responsible for plumbing.",17
"I rented a house in a beach town in Texas whose owner lived in Seattle, and who was somewhat of a ""bohemian,"" didn't have much money to do upkeep on his property. Our water heater failed one winter (old unit/normal wear). I reached out to tell the owner, who asked me to foot the bill and then deduct $100/month from my rent until it was paid off. The plumber came and replaced the heater, charging a fair market price. I told him to bill the owner.",17
"FYI, you shouldn’t assume that something is legal or enforceable just because it’s in your lease. Landlords put illegal things in leases all the time. Even if you sign a lease, they can’t enforce terms that are counter to city/state/federal law.

So if I were you, I would look up local rental laws and tenant’s rights information. It may be the case that the landlord *is* legally responsible for plumbing costs even if he says he’s not. If you find that, send him the info and a copy of the bill. Worst case scenario, you could take him to small claims court.

Of course it may be perfectly legal—I don’t really know the law in this case, and laws vary a lot in different jurisdictions anyway. But don’t just assume that it’s legal because it’s in the lease.",17
"As a PSA, you can easily snake your own drain for like $30-50. It's not very hard and only take about a hour. There is almost nothing you can mess up, just watch a YT video and save yourself some money.",17
"do you use a screener or you have a list of stocks/ETFs that you consistently trade with? I am still learning from tasty and option alpha and it seems like ETF is preferred than individual stock. I'm at a loss because i look for major ETFs with high volume but those are high stock volume, not option volumes. and most of those ETFs are low IV.. can't really do the ""be the seller of high IV liquid underlying"" ...  Am I going at this the wrong way? how can i improve? thanks!",18
Can someone explain to me which Greek is the most important? I don’t know what theta means and I feel like I really should 😅,18
"If I've sold a covered call and the strike price has been breached, way before the option expiration date, do I get a notification from my trading platform (IBKR) to deliver the shares? and typically how much time do i have to deliver the underlying? Thanks.",18
Sold SPY 423/427 call spreads exp 11/10. Deep underwater and I can't get out or roll. Went all in. What are my options? Can't close. Can't roll. Just wait for expiry?,18
"Do you consider the speedometer on your car important? You don't look at it constantly. Most people only check it if they see a cop car near them, and then it is *super* important.

It's kind of the same with greeks, the importance of each greek is situational. Sometimes you care about delta, sometimes you don't. Sometimes theta is the most important, sometimes it isn't.

It's not hard to learn the basics of greeks. Here's a good ELI5 explainer:

Written: https://www.projectfinance.com/greeks-home/",18
The last month has been brutal for sellers like myself. 70% of the last month SPX has moved outside the expected daily move,19
Thank you,19
"Superb explanation! A genuine one thanks 
So according to this SPY would be around 428 ish",19
"I think nobody will sell you the option at $6.90 (with the stock at $0.33).

The open interest in that option (12/15 7.5 strike option) is 0.

The open interest in the 12/15 5 strike put is 0.

The open interest in the 12/15 2.5 strike put is 1.",20
"“Would there be a reason for this to be a bad idea?”

Is there a reason why ‘investing’ in a money losing company that has only one single employee whose job is to sell vested stock options to goofballs who think this is a real company?

Is this a serious post?",20
"The short answer is: yes, but you won't get filled.

You can try, and I would suggest doing the entire thing as one transaction so you don't get screwed.  You should be able to post your put purchase and your stock purchase as one order.

You won't get filled because it's free money.  This sort of thing is one of the ways market makers make money, so they snap those up immediately when someone sells a put or call that is free money.  They can post hundreds or thousands of orders on both sides and just take the small amounts here and there when people want to exit or enter positions with low liquidity.

They also pay low or no fees for transactions or exercising.",20
"You’re asking “if I can buy the stock for .33 and sell it .60 at the same time, should I do that?”  

As someone else pointed out, you’re not getting filled for 6.90. That’s below parity. Furthermore if you post a $6.90 bid with the stock .33, and (somehow) an order came in to sell them @6.90, 99.9% chance they would end up trading higher, as the MMs would step in front of you with a better bid.",20

"The highest price target on NVDA is $1100, the median price target is $625 and the lowest price target is $535, which is $80 ABOVE the current stock price of $455. [https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda/analystestimates](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/nvda/analystestimates).

 Buying NVDA now is an absolute no-brainer.",25
"Investing Strategy: Charlie Munger style: just buy and sit on my ass investing for long term. Just the most profitable companies for long term growth. 

Investing timeline: 5 to 10 years

&#x200B;

My portfolio has few dozen stocks so I'll just share the top 15.

This combo has amazing low volatilty and above market return.

I have a low allocation to banks because of risk of write down and slow growth. I bought FCNCA as a vote of confidence for their amazing risk management. They stay disciplined and wait for other banks to get in trouble and buy at huge discount, clean up their mess and fix their risky behaviour.  The management reminds of me of Warren Buffett !

"My portfolio is bad right now but I might as well share it, currently 14 and trying to make some money.

Silver 71.22% 34oz or $810.22

SCHG 38.78% $327.35",25
Be careful with companies that have very high debt and low cash. You have to understand why they have the debt and what they use it for. For instance ENB has market cap of around $66B and debt of $67B. This is very high leverage and the interest rates are getting higher. What did they need the money for? Can they keep paying such a high dividend? And many more questions you should find answers for to evaluate the investment.,25
"I've later regretted every time that I sold it, but on the other hand, I've recovered my initial investment at least 3 or 4 times.   Still hold a fair stake.   To the moon!",26
Sold my position at an average of $312. This is why it’s up.,26
They can even de-throne Apple in case AI hype continues.,26
"In time, Microsoft will be more valuable than Apple.",26
"Is it hype though?

I’m not so sure, I just watched an international chess master play ChatGPT 4, he won, but only just and they had an ongoing conversation about the game. I’m still processing what I just saw.",26
"My sympathy to shareholders in pain, hopefully today's low of day is the bottom",27
They have a going concern issue meaning bankruptcy might be close. Be careful how much you put in here. Might be losing it all.,27
Isn’t this an example of ‘catching a falling knife.’,27
"144,625,410 short shares which is 26% of the float.  
Every share that was shorted from near the top has paid the short at least $60. So, if it was 100k short starting near the top, the short made $6,000,000. The price would have to hit $60 before it would even look like a problem to the short seller.  
There is way more money running pump and dumps than there ever will be investing.",27
The company said they’re running out of money - the bottom for this company is zero unless they get purchased,27
I seen this deal in another post but this seems like an interesting deal for them,28
Ofc their CEO is showing enthusiasm lmao,28
I've been following this deal the last month or so when I seen that they finally pulled the trigger on this I was pretty impressed. Really thought it would be a sale but nonetheless cant complain,28
45m units over three years is a really solid deal,28
"That's fine for right now since FXAX is the  Fidelity 500 Index Fund.. 

Sounds like you are focused and on the right track at a young age. 

Also get a retirement account from your place of employment if they offer a match.. Never leave money on the table..

Best to you",30
Look to getting some silver (1 oz. coin or round). Check out Lynette Zang or Peter Schiff on Youtube.,30
Great job starting so early! Starting early makes a huge difference in the long run.,30
"You can always find companies that are discounted, it takes time, effort and learning  https://youtu.be/A8eTVY-tUZE",31
You should invest in Enron,31

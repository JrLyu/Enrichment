0,"Let's talk about the popular Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A). The company's shares received a lot of attention from a substantial price movement on the NYSE over the last few months, increasing to US$128 at one point, and dropping to the lows of US$103. Some share price movements can give investors a better opportunity to enter into the stock, and potentially buy at a lower price. A question to answer is whether Agilent Technologies' current trading price of US$104 reflective of the actual value of the large-cap? Or is it currently undervalued, providing us with the opportunity to buy? Let’s take a look at Agilent Technologies’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  View our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies  According to my valuation model, Agilent Technologies seems to be fairly priced at around 18% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy Agilent Technologies today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $126.93, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Is there another opportunity to buy low in the future? Since Agilent Technologies’s share price is quite volatile, we could potentially see it sink lower (or rise higher) in the future, giving us another chance to buy. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for how much the stock moves relative to the rest of the market. Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Buying a great company with a robust outlook at a cheap price is always a good investment, so let’s also take a look at the company's future expectations. With profit expected to grow by 49% over the next couple of years, the future seems bright for Agilent Technologies. It looks like higher cash flow is on the cards for the stock, which should feed into a higher share valuation. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in A’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on A, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

3,"The external fund manager backed by Berkshire Hathaway's Charlie Munger, Li Lu, makes no bones about it when he says 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We note that Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders? Debt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. The first thing to do when considering how much debt a business uses is to look at its cash and debt together.  See our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies  As you can see below, Agilent Technologies had US$2.79b of debt at July 2023, down from US$2.91b a year prior. However, it also had US$1.33b in cash, and so its net debt is US$1.46b. Zooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Agilent Technologies had liabilities of US$1.76b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$3.36b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$1.33b in cash and US$1.34b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$2.45b. Since publicly traded Agilent Technologies shares are worth a very impressive total of US$32.0b, it seems unlikely that this level of liabilities would be a major threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. We use two main ratios to inform us about debt levels relative to earnings. The first is net debt divided by earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), while the second is how many times its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) covers its interest expense (or its interest cover, for short). This way, we consider both the absolute quantum of the debt, as well as the interest rates paid on it. Agilent Technologies's net debt is only 0.83 times its EBITDA. And its EBIT easily covers its interest expense, being 26.1 times the size. So you could argue it is no more threatened by its debt than an elephant is by a mouse. On the other hand, Agilent Technologies saw its EBIT drop by 6.7% in the last twelve months. If earnings continue to decline at that rate the company may have increasing difficulty managing its debt load. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Agilent Technologies's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this free report showing analyst profit forecasts. Finally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. So it's worth checking how much of that EBIT is backed by free cash flow. Over the last three years, Agilent Technologies recorded free cash flow worth a fulsome 85% of its EBIT, which is stronger than we'd usually expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so. The good news is that Agilent Technologies's demonstrated ability to cover its interest expense with its EBIT delights us like a fluffy puppy does a toddler. But, on a more sombre note, we are a little concerned by its EBIT growth rate. When we consider the range of factors above, it looks like Agilent Technologies is pretty sensible with its use of debt. That means they are taking on a bit more risk, in the hope of boosting shareholder returns. We'd be motivated to research the stock further if we found out that Agilent Technologies insiders have bought shares recently. If you would too, then you're in luck, since today we're sharing our list of reported insider transactions for free. If, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay. Have feedback on this article?

4,"SANTA CLARA, Calif., October 19, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Agilent Technologies Inc. (NYSE: A) today announced the company’s near and long-term targets for reaching net-zero greenhouse gas emissions have been approved by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The targets support the ambitious goal to limit planetary warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. ""Companies have an important role to play in driving the transition to a green economy,"" said Agilent President and CEO Mike McMullen. ""Having measurable goals for this work is critical to ensuring sustainable growth that will enable communities and business to thrive for generations to come."" SBTi is an independent organization that validates company emissions targets to ensure they meet the criteria required to prevent the worst effects of climate change. The SBTi partners with the CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute, and World Wide Fund for Nature in defining and validating targets grounded in climate science. Agilent publicly committed to net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions targets in 2021. This important goal was made in addition to adopting the Global Reporting Initiative guidelines in 2004, the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) recommendations in 2020, and the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework in 2021. Below are Agilent’s SBTi-approved targets, all of which are measured from a base year of 2019. 2030 Targets Reduce absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50% Reduce absolute Scope 3 GHG emissions from purchased goods and services, capital goods, upstream transportation and distribution, business travel, and employee commuting by 30% 2050 Target Reduce absolute Scope 1, 2, and 3 GHG emissions by 95% Since 2014, Agilent has reduced Scope 1 and 2 emissions by one third by investing in renewable energy sources, reducing energy consumption, and transitioning to energy-efficient systems and technology. In 2022, the company launched a plan to reduce Scope 3 emissions in the supply chain, which includes creating a baseline of supplier emissions contributions, educating suppliers about net-zero targets, and planning workshops and forums to support their goal setting and progress. ""We are also helping our customers on their journey toward net zero,"" said Neil Rees, head of ESG programs at Agilent.

5,"Agilent Technologies (NYSE:A) has had a rough three months with its share price down 6.5%. However, stock prices are usually driven by a company’s financial performance over the long term, which in this case looks quite promising. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Agilent Technologies'  ROE today. Return on Equity or ROE is a test of how effectively a company is growing its value and managing investors’ money. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.  View our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies  Return on equity can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Agilent Technologies is: 20% = US$1.1b ÷ US$5.6b (Based on the trailing twelve months to July 2023). The 'return' is the yearly profit. One way to conceptualize this is that for each $1 of shareholders' capital it has, the company made $0.20 in profit. We have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or ""retains"" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. To start with, Agilent Technologies' ROE looks acceptable. Further, the company's ROE compares quite favorably to the industry average of 13%. This probably laid the ground for Agilent Technologies' moderate 14% net income growth seen over the past five years. As a next step, we compared Agilent Technologies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 21% in the same period. Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is A fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know. In Agilent Technologies' case, its respectable earnings growth can probably be explained by its low three-year median payout ratio of 20% (or a retention ratio of 80%), which suggests that the company is investing most of its profits to grow its business. Moreover, Agilent Technologies is determined to keep sharing its profits with shareholders which we infer from its long history of paying a dividend for at least ten years. Based on the latest analysts' estimates, we found that the company's future payout ratio over the next three years is expected to hold steady at 16%. However, Agilent Technologies' ROE is predicted to rise to 27% despite there being no anticipated change in its payout ratio. In total, we are pretty happy with Agilent Technologies' performance. Specifically, we like that the company is reinvesting a huge chunk of its profits at a high rate of return. This of course has caused the company to see a good amount of growth in its earnings. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

Agilent is capitalizing on the trend and gaining traction in the life science research space. The pharmaceutical market holds immense prospects, courtesy of the growing utilization of electronic testing equipment. Rising demand for RF test equipment by medical device manufacturers is another uptrend. Macroeconomic Headwinds Pose Concerns: Rising inflationary pressure and fears of global recession have negatively impacted the rate of deal wins. Due to the challenging macroeconomic scenario, enterprises are reluctant to sign multi-year deals worldwide. These trends do not bode well for industry participants. The Zacks Electronics – Testing Equipment industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #77, which places it in the top 31% of more than 250 Zacks industries. The group's Zacks Industry Rank, basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates solid near-term prospects.

8,"Generally speaking the aim of active stock picking is to find companies that provide returns that are superior to the market average. And while active stock picking involves risks (and requires diversification) it can also provide excess returns. For example, the Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) share price is up 70% in the last 5 years, clearly besting the market return of around 51% (ignoring dividends). So let's assess the underlying fundamentals over the last 5 years and see if they've moved in lock-step with shareholder returns.  View our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies  In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. One way to examine how market sentiment has changed over time is to look at the interaction between a company's share price and its earnings per share (EPS). Over half a decade, Agilent Technologies managed to grow its earnings per share at 33% a year. This EPS growth is higher than the 11% average annual increase in the share price. So one could conclude that the broader market has become more cautious towards the stock. You can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). This free interactive report on Agilent Technologies' earnings, revenue and cash flow is a great place to start, if you want to investigate the stock further. As well as measuring the share price return, investors should also consider the total shareholder return (TSR). Whereas the share price return only reflects the change in the share price, the TSR includes the value of dividends (assuming they were reinvested) and the benefit of any discounted capital raising or spin-off. So for companies that pay a generous dividend, the TSR is often a lot higher than the share price return. We note that for Agilent Technologies the TSR over the last 5 years was 76%, which is better than the share price return mentioned above. And there's no prize for guessing that the dividend payments largely explain the divergence! Investors in Agilent Technologies had a tough year, with a total loss of 11% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 20%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Longer term investors wouldn't be so upset, since they would have made 12%, each year, over five years. It could be that the recent sell-off is an opportunity, so it may be worth checking the fundamental data for signs of a long term growth trend. If you would like to research Agilent Technologies in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company. Of course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this free list of companies we expect will grow earnings.

9,"The fact that multiple Agilent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:A) insiders offloaded a considerable amount of shares over the past year could have raised some eyebrows amongst investors. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more. While we would never suggest that investors should base their decisions solely on what the directors of a company have been doing, we do think it is perfectly logical to keep tabs on what insiders are doing.  Check out our latest analysis for Agilent Technologies  Over the last year, we can see that the biggest insider sale was by the Senior VP and President of Order Fulfillment & Supply Chain, Henrik Ancher-Jensen, for US$4.6m worth of shares, at about US$156 per share. While insider selling is a negative, to us, it is more negative if the shares are sold at a lower price. The good news is that this large sale was at well above current price of US$110. So it may not shed much light on insider confidence at current levels. In total, Agilent Technologies insiders sold more than they bought over the last year. You can see a visual depiction of insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last 12 months, below. If you want to know exactly who sold, for how much, and when, simply click on the graph below! For those who like to find winning investments this free list of growing companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket. Over the last three months, we've seen notably more insider selling, than insider buying, at Agilent Technologies. In total, Principal Accounting Officer Rodney Gonsalves sold US$416k worth of shares in that time. On the other hand we note Principal Accounting Officer Rodney Gonsalves bought US$288 worth of shares , as previously mentioned . Because the selling vastly outweighs the buying, we'd say this is a somewhat bearish sign. For a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Agilent Technologies insiders own about US$91m worth of shares. That equates to 0.3% of the company. While this is a strong but not outstanding level of insider ownership, it's enough to indicate some alignment between management and smaller shareholders. Unfortunately, there has been more insider selling of Agilent Technologies stock, than buying, in the last three months. And our longer term analysis of insider transactions didn't bring confidence, either. Insider ownership isn't particularly high, so this analysis makes us cautious about the company. We're in no rush to buy! Therefore, you should definitely take a look at this FREE report showing analyst forecasts for Agilent Technologies. But note: Agilent Technologies may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this free list of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt. For the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests. Have feedback on this article?

0,You can add AAL to the list of stocks that Robinhood is now blocking you from purchasing. This is straight up criminal what they're doing. I'm IN
1,"Not just GME.  Anyone that owns $AAL, $AMC, $BB, $BBY, $CTRM, $EXPR, $GME, $KOSS, $NAKD, $NOK, $SNDL, $TR, and $TRVG right now."
2,"RH IPO will go to shit. I guaranteed it. This was a dumb decision on the CEO for approving this shenanigans.

&#x200B;

I'm holding ERIC, NOK and AAL. Sorry can't afford anything else."
3,4 shares at market open. Probably would have gotten another. Likewise had an AAL call
4,"You can't even look up GME, AMC, NOK, AAL, or any of the others. Like they just flat out aren't there. They can use AI to make millisecond trades and run companies into the ground but God forbid any of us make a penny."
5,How does everyone feel about AAL?
6,"Im a nurse and we always appreciate the food donated.  Im doing vaccines now and was able to buy AMC, AAL, GME thanks to reddit"
7,AAL $20 September 18th call option. You are just betting on buffet pumping it again and you make millions upon millions.
8,That feel when I have AAL at 17c 8/20. I‚Äôm rooting for this
9,"Fuck you and fuck this!  


ASO. I LIKE THE STOCK AND THE STORE. 

45% SHORTED AND 90 million shares total. 

ROCKET SCIENCE!  

I am long GME, AMC, BB, BBBY, NOK, ASO, AAL,  because I don‚Äôt give a fuck. Yolo retards!


Now roast me retards or roast the hedge cunts that profit from taking down companies instead of helping to build them! Cheeky fucks."
10,AAL went bankrupt in 2011. GM in 2009. These companies just get restructured. Anyone thinking bailing out a company will save jobs is out of their minds.
11,I rode AAL from 10 to 20 last year betting on the recovery. Then sold it all because it‚Äôs a horrible long-term investment.
12,Loosing half a million on a call options Yolo for the same stock ist pretty fucked up. But loosing it on a shit stock like AAL is borderline retarded. You earned my respect sir! See you at Wendy‚Äôs next week I guess
13,Ouch.  Why AAL?  That‚Äôs a lot of confidence.
14,"I am really sorry man.  I looked back over the previous posts and the sunk cost fallacy was pretty clear .  This should also be a warning or illuminate caution to all others .  While I see that some people are impressed with the loss and are making jokes , I gotta say I am so sorry .  You really believes in AAL and it was clear that you thought that the logic made sense / airlines picking up, demand going up, the Jim Kramer and others are touting this stock.

Not investment advice .  But you may wish to sell right now whatever you have any value in , and take a step back - get into some counseling , and use this as a good opportunity to think about how important you are to those around you and how much you are loved by family and friends etc.  It‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the inertia but it‚Äôs really important to give yourself some compassion man. 

The limit or the amount I have put into the market is $5,000. I am playing in the house money now . But I‚Äôve almost lost it all, and then slowly nursed it back.

Anyway, I doubt you will read this But if you do, I‚Äôll be thinking of you, in your moment or solitude ; and really hope and wish for the best for you.  Your loss and belief in the markets is stunning - but also your belief in yourself ; and your trust in the market to do the right thing ,, is remarkable .  Don‚Äôt stop believing in things and trusting in people - but just do so in a better guarded manner .

Best wishes , friend ."
15,You deserve it for buying calls on AAL
16,">[AAL is the only Airline recovery stock to buy.](https://imgur.com/a/4NVMocP)

lmao this dude was so confident. F"
17,Might be able to work at AAL‚Ä¶ they‚Äôve resumed hiring.
18,imagine losing it all on AAL üò≥
19,"You know you don‚Äôt need to hold them to expiration, right?  That said it‚Äôs not 8/20 at 4pm yet - you still have time.  Maybe AAL announces some new routes to Kabul or something"
20,"What in the actual fuck?!

&#x200B;

Out of ALLLLLL the airlines you could have chosen, you went $AAL??!?"
21,Bummer the AAL calls were printing a few months ago
22,"Hey man, honestly this is some concerning behavior. I think you should seek out some help. Contact a friend or family member and see if they can loan you some money for a gambling addiction treatment center‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..then put it all in an AAL call!!!!! It‚Äôs right about to rocket!!!!!"
23,Um. Is your entire port in AAL? Why?
24,"It still just absolute boggles my mind, that people with accounts larger than $50k are so stupid that they even touch options in a large size. Why not just buy commons. If you bought AAL at 22 with your account, you would had roughly 23k shares. For every dollar increment up you would make $23k and vice versa. AAL is currently down at 18.73. Total net loss ~100k with all of infinity left to recover. Will options going in your favor made you a multi millionaire? Sure if theta and IV hadn‚Äôt already fucked you. There is way more that goes into understanding options than simply buy and sell. You guys realize MM are writing these calls right? And last time I checked wall street is fucking booming right now. Why are you morons betting against the house. Its like saying lets all stand in front of a train. We should be able to stop it with more numbers. With that all aside why the fk didnt you set stop losses, 20% hard stop loss. Why are your positions -99%. Fk man this enrages me, this is life changing money even if you just put it into an etf and called it a day. You dont even have to invest, you can just keep it for a rainy day and you would never have to worry about retiring and being broke ever again, if the economy tanks you can survive, god forbid an emergency happens you will be able to survive. I think alot of you are dreaming of lambos and yachts and forgetting the 1st thing you must secure is your survival for the rest of your life. Than buy the lambos and whatever, but make sure that if you had to retire today you could"
25,In August. When people are on vacation. But not using AAL to fly anywhere.
26,"""Dang, lost $350k on AAL calls. Good thing I got another $150k and more calls available."""
27,AAL owes him at least one first class...
28,I am out $8000 on AAL and probably another $9K on UAL.  You are lucky to turn a profit on airline stocks.
29,"Same. I decided to fly American to see how their customer service was. When I saw the mountains of complaints from people, the huge I mean 4 hours + lines to rebook with only 3 people working the kiosks and the kicker they routed my luggage to a different connecting flight I vowed that the next day I would sell all of my holdings of AAL. People vote with their pocket books. If customers hate flying with AAL, it won‚Äôt matter the re-opening play. I divested over 30k in AAL and put them into JBLU, DELTA, SOUTHWEST and ALASKA which are my 4 favorites domestic airlines to fly on.

Not only that, the # of horror stories from AAL has recently spiked up. So many people I talked to told me that American cancelled their flight due to weather and no only didn‚Äôt provide accommodations they flat out didn‚Äôt care. It doesn‚Äôt take much to see that that AAL doesn‚Äôt care at all about their customers."
30,He needs to find the AAL employee who game him this stock ‚Äútip‚Äù and kick the living shit out of him.
31,"If i was gonna blow that QTY of money on only calls, i would pick pick boring FAANG leaps at least. AAL is a mid tier airline so it‚Äôs extremely questionable"
32,"Think of it like a form of betting where you pay a premium to bet that a stock will hit a certain (strike) price by a specific date. You‚Äôre essentially buying a contract where you can control 100 shares without having to pay the price of 100 shares up front (aka leverage). If you‚Äôre on the right side of the bet, you can sell your contracts which are worth a lot more now that you‚Äôve hit the strike price (in the money). If you can afford to buy 100 shares of the stock (each contract is 100 shares) then you have the right but not the obligation to buy those shares at the strike price and profit additionally from the gains for those 100 shares. If you‚Äôre on the wrong side of this bet, you lose everything as your contracts have expired and are worth absolutely nothing like OPs AAL calls at closing today"
33,Hello i would like to buy stock in AAL call options please
34,"In addition to it being an app that you can‚Äôt edit, his history is filled with increasingly desperate posts about AAL.  The bored billionaire option seems more likely, but I don‚Äôt see one of those putting in the dedication of posting about it in that manner.  My condolences to the OP."
35,Yeah I bought like 3k worth of AAL in April 2020 and sold in June 2020 it worked out fine for me. 11.68-21.24. I‚Äôm not risking my life on it though lol.
36,Idk why i picked you you but can you explain ops deal to me? I get that $18 something is today‚Äôs AAL stock price today‚Ä¶.and tomorrow he promised to buy it at $0.01? Guess I don‚Äôt understand calls yet.
37,So Op did many desperate  posts about AAL in the past and obviously didn't take at all any safety advice ?
38,"one month ago op made a post talking about how AAL is ""free money""

I'm so fucking done lmao"
39,If you wrote an sold AAL calls it would‚Äôve been free money... maybe op misunderstood
40,"Just FYI they are fucking with American Airlines as well (AAL). I bought AAL shares months into the pandemic now I can't even search for it in their app. I'm pulling every cent I have out of this app.

Edit: I don't know why you're downvoting me. Just go look for yourself!"

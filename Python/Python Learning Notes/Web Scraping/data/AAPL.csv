Probably not. Fees are now stabilizing above 30%. For reference, AAPL and AMZN are both 0.3%. 

Conceivably, they can continue to just cover on the down swings. The problem is that the volume is so low with restricted buying and people not selling, any real covering would shoot the price up. We don't know exactly how many shares the shorts have, but if it's still over 100% of float then it will take months. Considering that they've already lost billions, they are hoping that a drop happens soon. 

Realistically, their deadline is Q4 earnings because that's when we'll likely get a big announcement from Gamestop. My goal was to pay down some outstanding credit card debt, I've done that with only a fraction of my position. I'm cool waiting out until long term gains kicks in."
1,"So I did a quick digging in on my own to support the authors claim. These data are all publicly available on the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), what I simply did was to aggregate them by month and looked at the percentage of fail to deliver shares as a proportion of the float based on the yahoo finance. I picked a couple of companies which are 'hot' on WSB now and also some large caps that have been under heavy shorting such as TSLA and AAPL. GS was also chosen to see how things look like for large banks with their own clearing house.

As you can see in the two graphs below, the percentage of fail to deliver for GME is through the roof for the past year. Even for heavily shorted stocks like TSLA, the percent of shares that failed to deliver is extremely low throughout 2020.

In terms of the total number of shares, it is clear that there is a lot of naked shorting and a ridiculous number of shares failed to deliver over the course of 2020.

The fact that this data is publicly available from SEC and that SEC has not acted upon it is beyond my comprehension. Then again I'm only a retard who loves GME and will hold it to infinity and beyond. And please don't be a smart ass and start buying other companies. Hold on and buy GME, this house needs some cleaning up. Screw the central banks for printing so much money and allowing the whole financial system to become as blatantly corrupt as it as become.

2,"I think there is some misunderstanding about this. The $25B that GME is worth or $47B the float is worth at $1000 per share might sound like a lot of money. But these short selling hedge fund fucks have way way more money than that and so do the brokerages and banks. When it comes time to buy out their short positions, I guarantee they will come up with the money. The hedge funds may have to liquidate some of their long positions or borrow some more money from Citadel, but they will do it. For those of your worried that you have some of your pension or your 401k in stocks that might get sold off. Even if we are talking about $100 billion ($2000 a share for GME) or let‚Äôs get crazy here, $500 billion ($10,000 a share, 30X where we are now), we are talking about $500 billion compared to $50 TRILLION dollars of total US market stock capitalization. For those good at math, that‚Äôs a measly 1%. Yes if the hedge funds liquidate some positions in GM or AAPL or whatever their price will take a very small temporary dip, but everyone else who didn‚Äôt have to liquidate will snatch it up while it‚Äôs on sale. So don‚Äôt let these assholes tell you that if you buy GME it will somehow wreck the stock market and entire financial system, that‚Äôs just them trying to scare you."
3,"- Their unassailable lead in EVs that keeps getting bigger (better software for battery management, better mileage, much more data collected for self-driving than anyone else, better and constantly improving manufacturing techniques and machines.. I could go on)
- They will finish solving self-driving this year, and lease the software to other companies who have no hope of catching up. That's $$$$
- They consistently meet or beat their targets that matter most, especially deliveries (half million in 2020 targeted by Musk in 2014, target met)
- Rapid expansion happening in 2021 and every year after (more factories, more output from their two existing factories, more efficient processes)
- Their unexpected (by the mainstream media anyway) success and record numbers during the pandemic
- Solar and battery tech
- Their investment in neural networks and cameras to solve self driving (like a human brain + eyes) on existing infrastructure instead of wasting time with LIDAR (lol)
- Autonomous taxis (billions in potential alone)
- Elon Musk. This one matters most. I'd rather invest in people than numbers that look good on a spreadsheet

Tesla is absolutely not worth $800/share ($800 billion market cap) right now, but in 10 years that will look DIRT CHEAP.

I buy TSLA every chance I get. Couldn't care less what it costs right now.

From 2008 to 2018 I was all about AAPL and did very well. For the next decade I'm all-in on TSLA."
4,"Psh, old wsb was praying to SuBAE for AMC tendies and watching people yolo on AAPL earnings calls.

Edit: I‚Äôm an idiot. AMD."
5,"For the benefit of /r/all, ""The Canadian"" lied on /r/wallstreetbets about making an extremely risky trade with his last $100-200k. Per the original post, he stood to make a huge amount of money only if Apple's share price (AAPL) fell dramatically over the next month as a result of their earnings report today.

He did a live stream, during which several users noticed that the account he used to make the ""trades"" was in fact a demo account, meaning he lied about doing the trade with real money.

Edit: Corrected Apple's ticker symbol, it's AAPL, and not APPL"

8,AAPL?
9,"He supposedly shorted AAPL using his last $250k, but was really using a demo account."
10,"Tldr is canadian guy says he got 2.5 million inheritance. 

blew all but 250k on Wall Street bets and other shit.

 Says he will Yolo 250k on AAPL dropping a fuck ton. Streams today which is AAPL Q1 release day and accidentally showed his account ID which is demo account(Fake money).


 It was fake all along."

12,AAPL
13,"That's a great point - in terms of the asset inflation. 

I believe in that on the overall market, but certain tickers I'm still a bit skeptical about - like AAPL - posting similar financials for 2-3 years yet valuations doubled. But then again, they are considered one of the markets 'safest' places to park your money, in the era of zero interest rates and increased money supply."
14,"Same. Sold AAPL, AMD etc. calls for GME.

What can I say? I like the stock."
15,"I kind of agree. But if you bought shares for every shares for the stock that had elaborate DD in this sub you almost exclusively made money if you didnt paper hand  **üßª‚úã** like a retard. TSLA, NIO, AAPL, PRPL, PLTR, GME are just the most notable examples.  
Ofc you're gonna get fucked if you buy weeklies first day in or sell at the slightest dip."
16,"I'm a theta guy joining in to fight the good fight.  MSFT, AAPL and FB have earnings in the next couple of days. Once those earnings plays print that'll free up a lot of capital for a lot of people. You glorious bastards just need to hold the line.

You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention."
17,"Exactly right, waiting for the AAPL earnings and I'll be on the front lines with you tards on GME. WE LIKE THE STOCK"
18,Shoot I‚Äôll throw another 2k at it.  Sold 200 boomer ass AAPL shares to reload for outer space baby!

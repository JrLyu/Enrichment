1,"(Bloomberg) -- Some Wall Street analysts are checking out of Airbnb Inc. stock as the company attempts to execute a turnaround. Most Read from Bloomberg House Speaker Mike Johnson’s First Big Bill Cuts Biden’s Climate Change Funding US Military Attacks Two Syrian Facilities It Says Linked to Iran China, US Release Dueling Videos With Accusations of Provocation Israel Latest: US Strikes Two Iran-Linked Facilities in Syria The number of those with sell ratings on the vacation-rental site has risen to an all-time high, with six of the analysts who cover it recommending that investors dump the stock. They’re still in the minority, with the other three dozen nearly evenly divided over whether investors should buy or just stay put. But the bears might be onto something. Just two years ago, when Airbnb’s market value was nearly twice what it is today, its annual revenue growth was pushing 80% as remote work and the pandemic unleashed a flood of demand. This year, sales are projected to expand just 17% and fall further in 2024. Still, Airbnb’s stock is priced at about 26 times projected profits, roughly the same as Apple Inc. Airbnb shares are down Friday, on track for a fourth consecutive week of declines. Some analysts see a number of obstacles to Airbnb living up to that valuation. In September, New York City changed rules around short-term rentals in a way that drastically curbed the company’s listings, joining others that have sought to curb Airbnb as they contend with housing scarcities that have pushed up rents. Canada is also considering enacting new rules for short-term rentals that would hit Airbnb and VRBO. “I just don’t see where their growth comes from, whether it be services or anywhere else,” said Ross Gerber, co-founder and CEO of wealth management firm Gerber Kawasaki Inc. His firm holds MGM Resorts International but not Airbnb.

Keybanc in October downgraded Airbnb to sector-weight from overweight and removed its price target, saying that margins have reached a near-term peak and revenue growth could decelerate next year as the travel tailwind fades. “We believe this could create an overhang on shares as ABNB transitions from a growth” investor base to one focused on GARP — or growth at a reasonable price, analysts led by Justin Patterson wrote, referring to Airbnb by its ticker symbol. Seaport Research Partners initiated coverage of Airbnb with a neutral rating in an Oct. 24 note, saying that the risk-reward is “fairly balanced” given their expectation for moderating bookings growth. “Given the robust bookings trends in 2021/2022 following the pandemic, we expect more steady growth going forward, particularly in the US,” analyst Aaron Kessler wrote in a note. “That said, there is still room for ample growth long-term with alternative accommodations representing less than 20% of total accommodations.” Yet bulls are standing their ground ahead of the company’s third quarter earnings report, scheduled for Wednesday Nov. 1 after market close. One reason is that they still see pent-up demand for travel, especially with consumer spending continuing to drive the US economy. “We feel like the revenge travel wave is definitely still in full effect,” said Brian Mulberry, client portfolio manager at Zacks Investment Management. “We’re not unhappy with how the market looks in terms of the demand structure and the ability for consumers to spend that money.” He added that as long-term investors, Zacks has no issues with Airbnb’s business model and sees changing short-term rental rules as a near-term challenge the company can overcome. Ivan Feinseth, chief investment officer at Tigress Financial Partners LLC, agrees. He’s one of the largest Airbnb bulls on Wall Street with a $185 price target, implying a roughly 60% gain ahead. He thinks rules curbing short-term rentals aren’t likely to stick around. “When people travel to your city or country, those people, those tourists — or whatever you want to call them — are spenders,” he said. Tech Chart of the Day The Nasdaq 100 index dipped into the so-called correction territory on Thursday as tech stocks fell in recent days following disappointing results from Meta Platforms Inc. and Alphabet Inc. The tech-heavy benchmark fell 1.9% Thursday and has now fallen more than 10% since its July peak. The index reversed some of those losses on Friday, up about 1%. Top Tech Stories Amazon.com Inc. CEO Andy Jassy gave investors much of what they wanted this earnings season: robust sales and profit growth along with a hint that the cloud division earnings machine is regaining momentum. Intel Corp. surged in pre-market trading after predicting a return to sales growth in the fourth quarter, fueled by an improving personal computer market and a more competitive product line. In the race to rebound from a two-year slowdown in spending on cloud computing, Microsoft Corp. is pulling ahead of its chief rivals, Amazon.com Inc. and Google. Executives at X, the social media site formerly known as Twitter, said they see YouTube and LinkedIn as future competitors while pursuing new business lines in video and hiring. Tesla Inc. raised the price of its Model Y Performance sport-utility vehicle by around $2,000 in China on Friday, according to its local website, reversing a reduction made only in August. An import ban on certain Apple Watch models would begin on Christmas Day if the Biden administration declines to veto a US trade agency’s order over patented technology that measures the amount of oxygen in a user’s blood. Western Digital Corp. fell as much as 16% after deal negotiations with Kioxia Holdings Corp. broke down, quashing hopes for a combination of their flash memory businesses.

2,"Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this company have returned -15.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -3.4% change. The Zacks Internet - Content industry, to which Airbnb, Inc. belongs, has lost 5.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? Although media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision. Revisions to Earnings Estimates Rather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings. We essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Airbnb, Inc. is expected to post earnings of $2.08 per share, indicating a change of +16.2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.8% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $3.80 points to a change of +36.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +1.2%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $4.30 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Airbnb, Inc. is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1.2%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Airbnb, Inc. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Airbnb, Inc. the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $3.37 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +16.8%. For the current and next fiscal years, $9.85 billion and $11.16 billion estimates indicate +17.3% and +13.3% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Airbnb, Inc. reported revenues of $2.48 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +18.1%. EPS of $0.98 for the same period compares with $0.56 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.42 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.81%. The EPS surprise was +27.27%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. Comparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Airbnb, Inc. is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Airbnb, Inc. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

5,"Airbnb ABNB is scheduled to report third-quarter 2023 results on Nov 1.For the third quarter, Airbnb expects revenues between $3.3 billion and $3.4 billion, implying year-over-year growth in the band of 14-18% on a reported basis.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.37 billion, indicating growth of 16.9% from the year-ago quarter’s reported value.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings is pegged at $2.06 per share, suggesting growth of 15.1% from the year-ago reported figure.Airbnb’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in all the trailing four quarters, the average being 52.6%.Let’s see how things have shaped up for this announcement. Airbnb, Inc. price-eps-surprise | Airbnb, Inc. Quote Airbnb’s third-quarter 2023 results are expected to have benefited from the solid momentum in Nights and Experiences booked, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nights and Experiences Booked is pegged at 113 million, indicating growth of 13% from the year-ago reported figure.Further, the growing Average Daily Rate, driven by foreign exchange, mix shift of larger homes, and geographic mix, is expected to have impacted the to-be-reported quarterly performance.Moreover, strength across Cross-border nights booked, owing to increasing international travel demand, is likely to have aided Airbnb’s performance in the to-be-reported quarter.Additionally, increasing travel demand, growing awareness around hosting, and introducing new tools for hosts are likely to have resulted in strong supply growth across all regions and market types in the quarter under review.Also, strong momentum in new active listings, driven by reduced fees for longer stays and monthly discounts, is likely to have been another positive.All these factors are expected to have driven growth in gross booking value (GBV) in the third quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GBV is pegged at $17.97 billion, indicating growth of 15.2% from the reported figure in the year-ago quarter.However, intense competition in the online travel market is anticipated to have remained an overhang in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, growing macroeconomic challenges are likely to have been a major concern.

6,"Yelp (YELP) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. This widely-known consensus outlook gives a good sense of the company's earnings picture, but how the actual results compare to these estimates is a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This online business reviews company is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.35 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +169.2%. Revenues are expected to be $340.42 million, up 10.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.4% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Yelp? For Yelp, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +27.12%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #3. So, this combination indicates that Yelp will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Yelp would post earnings of $0.15 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.21, delivering a surprise of +40%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates three times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Yelp appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. Expected Results of an Industry Player Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB), another stock in the Zacks Internet - Content industry, is expected to report earnings per share of $2.06 for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate points to a year-over-year change of +15.1%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $3.37 billion, up 16.9% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Airbnb, Inc. has been revised 1.1% lower over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -10.04%.

8,"Investors interested in stocks from the Internet - Content sector have probably already heard of Weibo Corporation (WB) and Airbnb, Inc. (ABNB). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. The best way to find great value stocks is to pair a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits. Weibo Corporation has a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Airbnb, Inc. has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold) right now. The Zacks Rank favors stocks that have recently seen positive revisions to their earnings estimates, so investors should rest assured that WB has an improving earnings outlook. But this is just one piece of the puzzle for value investors. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category highlights undervalued companies by looking at a variety of key metrics, including the popular P/E ratio, as well as the P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that have been used by value investors for years. WB currently has a forward P/E ratio of 5.75, while ABNB has a forward P/E of 32.57. We also note that WB has a PEG ratio of 1.02. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. ABNB currently has a PEG ratio of 1.60. Another notable valuation metric for WB is its P/B ratio of 0.91. The P/B ratio is used to compare a stock's market value with its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. For comparison, ABNB has a P/B of 15.61. These metrics, and several others, help WB earn a Value grade of A, while ABNB has been given a Value grade of D. WB stands above ABNB thanks to its solid earnings outlook, and based on these valuation figures, we also feel that WB is the superior value option right now.

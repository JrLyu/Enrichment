0,"Integer Holdings Corporation ITGR delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $1.27 in the third quarter of 2023, which improved 33.7% year over year. The figure topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 20.9%. The adjustments include expenses related to the amortization of intangible assets and restructuring and restructuring-related charges, among others. GAAP EPS for the quarter was 81 cents, reflecting an improvement of 68.8% year over year. Integer Holdings registered revenues of $404.7 million in the third quarter, up 18.1% year over year. The figure surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 8.7%. Organically, revenues increased 17.8%. Robust Medical sales drove the company’s top line in the reported period. Integer Holdings operates through two segments — Medical Sales and Non-Medical Sales. Medical Sales reported revenues of $395.9 million, up 19.6% year over year on a reported and 19.3% on an organic basis. This figure compares to our Medical Sales third-quarter projection of $358.5 million. Medical Sales has three product lines — Advanced Surgical, Orthopedics & Portable Medical (AS&O); Cardio & Vascular; and Cardiac Rhythm Management (CRM) & Neuromodulation. Integer Holdings’ AS&O revenues amounted to $22.7 million, down 13.3% year over year both on a reported and organic basis. Per management, this resulted from the execution of the planned multi-year Portable Medical exit announced in 2022 and the low double-digit decline of Advanced Surgical and Orthopedics. This compares to our third-quarter projection of $29.7 million for AS&O revenues. Revenues at the Cardio & Vascular business totaled $214 million, up 22.9% from the prior-year quarter on a reported basis and up 22.2% organically. The solid year-over-year performance was driven by continued strong demand across all markets, growth in key products such as guidewires, new product ramps in electrophysiology and structural heart, and supply-chain improvements. This compares to our third-quarter projection of $185.8 million. Revenues at the Cardiac Rhythm Management & Neuromodulation business were $159.2 million, up 21.9% year over year both on a reported and organic basis, with double-digit growth in both CRM and Neuromodulation. The business was driven by strong demand, including double-digit growth from emerging customers with pre-market approval products and supply-chain improvements. This compares to our third-quarter projection of $143 million for the product line. Revenues in the Non-Medical segment totaled $8.8 million, down 25.3% year over year both on a reported and organic basis. This was due to Electrochem sales returning to a normalized run rate after previously higher sales from the supply-chain recovery. This figure compares to our segmental projection of $13.6 million for the third quarter. Integer Holdings Corporation price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | Integer Holdings Corporation Quote Integer Holdings generated a gross profit of $105.6 million in the third quarter, up 21.7% year over year. The gross margin in the reported quarter expanded 78 basis points (bps) to 26.1%. We had projected 25.8% of gross margin for the third quarter. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $42.1 million, up 10.2% year over year. Research, development and engineering costs were $14.5 million in the quarter, down 9.8% year over year. Adjusted operating expenses of $56.6 million increased 4.3% year over year. Adjusted operating profit totaled $48.9 million, reflecting a 50.9% uptick from the prior-year quarter. Adjusted operating margin in the third quarter expanded 263 bps to 12.1%. Integer Holdings exited the third quarter of 2023 with cash and cash equivalents of $32.1 million compared with $38.6 million at the end of the second quarter. Total debt (including the current portion) at the end of third-quarter 2023 was $941.4 million compared with $985.4 million at the second-quarter end. Cumulative net cash flow from operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2023 was $124.6 million compared with $64.8 million a year ago. Integer Holdings has upped its financial outlook for 2023 on the back of continued strong customer demand across its product lines. For 2023, the company now expects revenues in the range of $1,575 million-$1,595 million (suggesting an improvement of 14-16% from the 2022 reported figure), up from the earlier projection of $1,530 million-$1,550 million (suggesting an improvement of 11-13% from the 2022 reported figure). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $1.54 billion. The company now expects full-year adjusted EPS in the band of $4.47-$4.67 (suggesting a rise of 15-20% from the 2022 reported figure), up from the earlier projection of $4.23-$4.43 (suggesting a rise of 9-14% from the 2022 reported figure). The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $4.33. Integer Holdings exited the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The strong year-over-year top-line and bottom-line performances were impressive. Robust performances by the Medical segment and strength in the majority of the product lines of the Medical segment were encouraging. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock. Integer Holdings’ recent acquisition of certain assets of InNeuroCo, Inc. to strengthen neurovascular catheter capabilities (October 2023) also looks promising for the stock. However, the decline in Non-Medical revenues was discouraging. Integer Holdings continuing to navigate a challenging inflationary and supply-chain environment raises our apprehension. Integer Holdings currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Some better-ranked stocks in the broader medical space that have announced quarterly results are Abbott Laboratories ABT, Boston Scientific Corporation BSX and West Pharmaceutical Services, Inc. WST.

Merit Medical operates through two segments — Cardiovascular and Endoscopy. The Cardiovascular unit reported third-quarter revenues of $306.1 million, up 9.7% both on a reported basis and at CER year over year.

PI product line revenues were $128.4 million, up 16% on a reported basis and 15.9% at CER year over year. This compares to our projection of $118.8 million.

Cumulative net cash flow provided by operating activities at the end of third-quarter 2023 was $82.9 million compared with $86.3 million a year ago. Merit Medical has revised its 2023 outlook. Net revenues for 2023 are now projected between $1.242 billion and $1.251 billion (reflecting an increase of approximately 8-9% over the comparable reported figures of 2022), up from the prior guidance of $1.230 billion-$1.244 billion (reflecting an increase of approximately 7-8%). The Zacks Consensus Estimate stands at $1.24 billion. Net revenues from the Cardiovascular segment are now expected to be in the range of $1.205 - $1.214, representing an increase of approximately 8-9% over the comparable reported figures of 2022.

The Endoscopy segment’s net revenues are now projected to be between $36.9 million and $37.0 million, representing an increase of approximately 13% over the comparable reported figures of 2022. This is narrower than the prior outlook of $36.8 million-$37 million, representing an increase of approximately 12-13% over the comparable reported figures of 2022. Adjusted EPS for 2023 is now projected to be in the range of $2.93-$2.99, up from the prior outlook of $2.81-$2.92. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is pegged at $2.88. Merit Medical exited the third quarter of 2023 with better-than-expected results. The year-over-year uptick in the top and bottom lines was impressive. The company saw revenue growth in both its segments and across all the product categories within its Cardiovascular unit. Robust performances in the United States and outside were impressive. Strong execution and improving customer demand trends pushed up the overall top line, which was encouraging. The expansion of both margins bodes well for the stock. In August, Merit Medical announced the completion of enrolment in its WRAPSODY Arteriovenous Access Efficacy pivotal study. In September, the company announced the U.S. commercial release of its Aspira Bottle, the latest addition to its drainage portfolio. These also look promising for the stock. However, management’s expectations of CPS sales to decline in the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis as demand trends for these kit product lines normalize do not bode well. The current challenging global macro environment also raises our apprehension. Merit Medical currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

2,"DexCom, Inc. DXCM reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 50 cents, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 22 cents by 47.1%. The company reported earnings of 28 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. DXCM registered GAAP net income per share of 29 cents, up from the year-ago quarter’s figure of 24 cents. Shares of DexCom rose 17% in after-hours trading on Oct 26, following better-than-expected quarterly results. However, the stock has lost 28.4% year to date compared with the industry’s 15.5% decline. The broader S&P 500 Index has moved up 10% in the same period. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Total revenues grew 27% (26% on an organic basis) to $975 million on a year-over-year basis and beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4%. Strong revenue growth was driven by rising volumes on the back of increasing global awareness of the benefits of real-time Continuous Glucose Monitoring and strong customer additions. Sensor and other revenues(90% of total revenues) increased 31% on a year-over-year basis to $873.8 million. Hardware revenues (10%) decreased 2% year over year to $101.2 million. U.S. revenues (73% of total revenues) increased 24% on a year-over-year basis to $713.6 million. International revenues (27%) improved 33% (30% on an organic basis) year over year to $261.4 million. Gross profit totaled $623.3 million, up 26.1% from the prior-year quarter’s level. DexCom reported a gross margin (as a percentage of revenues) of 62.7%, which contracted approximately 30 basis points year over year. Research and development expenses amounted to $131.4 million, up 19.1% year over year. Selling, general and administrative expenses totaled $284.7 million, up 21.4% year over year. The company reported total operating expenses of $417.8 million, up 20.5% from the prior-year period’s recorded number. Operating margin (as a percentage of revenues) was 21.1%, up 190 bps year over year.  DXCM exited the third quarter with $3.24 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities compared with $3.64 billion in the preceding quarter. Total assets amounted to $6.6 billion compared with $6.82 billion on a sequential basis. DexCom raised its guidance for 2023 revenues and also raised its adjusted gross and operating margin outlook. The company now expects revenues in the range of $3.575-$3.6 billion, implying 23-24% year-over-year growth. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the same is pegged at $3.55 billion. Previously, DXCM expected revenues in the range of $3.5-$3.55 billion. DXCM now expects an adjusted gross margin of approximately 64% versus 63% previously. Adjusted operating margin is projected to be approximately 19%, up from the previous guidance of 17%. DXCM also announced a share repurchase program worth $500 million. DexCom exited third-quarter 2023 on a strong note, wherein both earnings and revenues beat their respective estimates. Impressive contributions from the Sensor segment, and domestic and international revenue growth were the key catalysts. Moreover, the expansion of coverage for CGM systems during the quarter supported growth. This trend is likely to continue for the rest of 2023. The availability of new sensors like G6 & G7 in new international markets is also boosting revenue growth. Additionally, the glucose monitoring market presents significant commercial opportunities for the company. DexCom’s prospects in alternative markets such as non-intensive diabetes management, hospital, gestational, pre-diabetes and obesity are likely to provide it with a competitive edge in the MedTech space. Apart from making continued advancements in terms of its key strategic objectives, the company continued to have strong new patient additions in the quarter. The expansion of gross and operating margins buoys optimism. However, cut-throat competition in the market for blood & glucose monitoring devices remains another concern.

3,"Abbott Launches Blueprint of Award-Winning Program To Help Companies Tackle This Problem New survey by Morning Consult on behalf of Abbott shows student loans are having a profound and far-reaching impact on young adults and their planning for the future 91% say financial stress is impacting their mental, physical wellness and student loan debt is a key driver of this financial stress 94% are interested in a workplace benefit in which they get an employer-provided 401(k) contribution as they pay off their school loans Abbott's new blueprint of its award-winning Freedom 2 Save program helps companies create a proven student loan benefit program for their people ABBOTT PARK, IL / ACCESSWIRE / October 26, 2023 / Ninety-one percent of young adults with student loans are so stressed about money they say it's impacting their physical and mental wellness, according to a new survey by Morning Consult on behalf of Abbott (NYSE:ABT). A key driver of that financial stress is student loan debt. In 2018 Abbott tackled the student debt crisis head-on with its first-of-its-kind, award-winning Freedom 2 Save program that helps employees pay off their student loans while also saving for the future. Now - with college tuition at a historic high, student loan debt exceeding $1 trillion and payments of federal student loans resuming after a more than three-year pause - Abbott is encouraging other employers to join in this effort with the launch of the Freedom 2 Save blueprint. The blueprint guides employers through the process of developing and implementing a benefit like Freedom 2 Save. Enacting this type of program will be easier starting in January 2024, thanks to a new federal law called the SECURE 2.0 Act, a provision of which was inspired by Freedom 2 Save. No longer will employers have to receive a private letter ruling from the IRS like Abbott had to do when creating the Freedom 2 Save program. ""Employees with student loans often have to choose between paying their school debt and saving for retirement. That's problematic because people who delay saving for the future will find it hard to catch up,"" said Mary Moreland, executive vice president, Human Resources, Abbott. ""The good news is that employers can help relieve some of this burden with a program like Freedom 2 Save. Our blueprint will help simplify the process."" IMPACT OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT Tens of millions of U.S. borrowers collectively owe $1.57 trillion in student loans, making them the third-largest form of consumer debt after mortgages and auto loans. This student loan debt is having a profound and far-reaching impact on young adults, according to the Morning Consult survey of more than 500 people ages 18-39 with student loans. The data reinforce the need for workplace programs that help tackle the student debt crisis. In fact, 94% of young adults with student debt expressed interest in an employer-provided 401(k) contribution as they pay off their school loans. Other key findings among those surveyed: 86% are concerned about having to resume federal student loan payments this month. 63% didn't pay their federal student loans at all during the three-year pause. And for 46%, student loans have impacted how much they contribute to their retirement plans. Among those whose retirement savings has been impacted by student loan debt: 86% have reduced the amount of money they contribute to their retirement account. 55% stopped contributing to their retirement plan. And 44% have withdrawn money from their retirement account. ""As the number of people with student loans grows, employees will increasingly be looking for companies to offer student loan repayment solutions that help them forge their financial futures,"" said Stacey MacPhetres, senior director, Education Finance, Bright Horizons EdAssist Solutions. ""This is a workplace benefit that employers need to seriously consider if they want to attract and retain key talent."" AN EMPLOYEE'S PERSPECTIVE When Cynthia Chan, a supply chain logistics planner in Abbott's vascular business, was job hunting, Freedom 2 Save was one of the factors that drew her to the company. ""I accumulated about $15,000 in student debt after earning my master's degree in chemical engineering and had no idea how I'd be able to pay my loans and save money for my future,"" said Chan. ""Freedom 2 Save lifted that weight off my shoulders. I've paid off nearly $5,000 while also saving for retirement, and can now see a time in the near future when I'll be free of this debt."" For those who choose to take advantage of Abbott's innovative program like Chan, here's what it could look like: Employees who join Abbott in their early 20s with starting annual pay of $70,000 and take advantage of this program could see $48,000 accumulate in their 401(k) accounts after 10 years, assuming a 5% annual return and yearly merit pay increases of 2% - without any 401(k) contribution of their own. That amount could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional retirement savings by age 60. ""Our people have invested a lot in their education, and we don't want that to keep them from saving while they're still young,"" said Moreland. ""We encourage other companies to download our blueprint and join us in this effort. Together we can help employees take on student loans and savings."" About Freedom 2 Save: Through Freedom 2 Save, employees who are eligible for the company's 401(k) and who apply at least 2% of their eligible salary toward paying down a qualifying student loan will receive a 5% company contribution into their Abbott 401(k) annually. Employees don't have to put any money into their 401(k) to get this company contribution. Abbott was named to Fortunemagazine's 2023 ""Change the World"" list for Freedom 2 Save, and the company was recognized by Pensions & Investments with an Innovation Award for the program. Freedom 2 Save was also featured in an essay in the book ""The Future of Building Wealth: Brief Essays on the Best Ideas to Build Wealth - for Everyone,"" published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in partnership with the Aspen Institute's Financial Security Program. About the SECURE 2.0 Act: Thanks to a provision in the SECURE 2.0 Act that was inspired by Freedom 2 Save, employers will be able to match student loan payments made by their employees with tax-advantaged contributions into their retirement accounts starting in January 2024. Morning Consult Methodology: The total sample size was 501 U.S. adults aged 18-39 who have continued with some form of education after high school, have existing student loan debt and live in a major U.S. market. The responding sample is weighted to the profile of the sample definition to provide a representative reporting sample. Interviews were conducted online in September 2023.

4,"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is warning health care providers and the public about injuries and at least one death in premature infants who were given probiotic products in the hospital. The products, which supplement regular feeding and contain live organisms such as bacteria or yeast, can lead to invasive, potentially fatal infections or disease, the FDA said Thursday. One death this year and more than two dozen reports of injuries since 2018 may be tied to the supplements, FDA officials said in a statement. The agency said it is also investigating additional reports of injuries and deaths. No probiotic products have been approved as a drug or treatment for babies, the FDA said. The agency issued warning letters to two companies accused of illegally marketing the probiotics products, including Abbott Laboratories, which was at the center of a recall and nationwide shortage of powdered infant formula last year. After a letter sent Tuesday, the Illinois firm agreed to halt sales of its Similac Probiotic Tri-Blend product and work with the FDA on additional corrective actions, the agency said. Abbott officials said in a statement that the products were used by fewer than 200 hospitals and are not related to Similac powdered infant formulas sold in stores. FDA officials in September said Evivo with MCT Oil, a probiotic made by Infinant Health of Norwalk, Connecticut, led to the death of a premature infant this year. Genetic sequencing confirmed that the bacterium that caused sepsis was the same germ found in the probiotic product. Infinant Health officials said in statement that the firm voluntarily recalled and discontinued the product. It was sold only for use in hospital settings and is not related to products available in retail stores. Probiotic supplements may be used to prevent necrotizing enterocolitis, a dangerous infection affecting premature infants that inflames and kills intestinal tissue. The condition affects up to 9,000 infants a year, with a death rate of about 50%. __ AP Health Writer Matthew Perrone in Washington contributed to this report. ___ The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

6,"CONMED Corporation CNMD delivered adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 90 cents in third-quarter 2023, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 83 cents by 8.4%. The bottom line also improved 16.9% from the year-ago quarter’s level. GAAP EPS for the quarter was 50 cents against a reported loss of $1.48 per share in the year-ago period. The company’s shares have risen 3.4% year to date compared with the industry’s growth of 8.8%. The broader S&P 500 Index has gained 10% in the same time frame. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research CONMED’s revenues totaled $304.6 million, up 10.7% year over year. The top line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3.9%. At constant exchange rate (CER), revenues increased 11.9%. Additional sales from the newly acquired businesses contributed approximately 40 basis points of growth. CNMD’s third-quarter sales were driven by strong growth in the U.S. as well as international markets. The company’s two products, In2Bones and Biorez, were the key drivers during the reported quarter. However, its legacy orthopedic business was hurt by supply constraints. Revenues in the Orthopedic Surgery segment totaled $124.7 million, up 5.1% from the year-ago quarter’s level on a reported basis. At CER, revenues increased 6.4%. The top line improved 1.3% on a reported basis on the domestic front. It also increased 7.5% (9.7% at CER) from the prior-year quarter’s level on the international front.

7,"New survey by Morning Consult on behalf of Abbott shows student loans are having a profound and far-reaching impact on young adults and their planning for the future 91% say financial stress is impacting their mental, physical wellness and student loan debt is a key driver of this financial stress 94% are interested in a workplace benefit in which they get an employer-provided 401(k) contribution as they pay off their school loans Abbott's new blueprint of its award-winning Freedom 2 Save program helps companies create a proven student loan benefit program for their people ABBOTT PARK, Ill., Oct. 26, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Ninety-one percent of young adults with student loans are so stressed about money they say it's impacting their physical and mental wellness, according to a new survey by Morning Consult on behalf of Abbott (NYSE: ABT). A key driver of that financial stress is student loan debt. In 2018 Abbott tackled the student debt crisis head-on with its first-of-its-kind, award-winning Freedom 2 Save program that helps employees pay off their student loans while also saving for the future. Now — with college tuition at a historic high, student loan debt exceeding $1 trillion and  payments of federal student loans resuming after a more than three-year pause — Abbott is encouraging other employers to join in this effort with the launch of the Freedom 2 Save blueprint. The blueprint guides employers through the process of developing and implementing a benefit like Freedom 2 Save. Enacting this type of program will be easier starting in January 2024, thanks to a new federal law called the SECURE 2.0 Act, a provision of which was inspired by Freedom 2 Save. No longer will employers have to receive a private letter ruling from the IRS like Abbott had to do when creating the Freedom 2 Save program. ""Employees with student loans often have to choose between paying their school debt and saving for retirement. That's problematic because people who delay saving for the future will find it hard to catch up,"" said Mary Moreland, executive vice president, Human Resources, Abbott. ""The good news is that employers can help relieve some of this burden with a program like Freedom 2 Save. Our blueprint will help simplify the process."" IMPACT OF STUDENT LOAN DEBTTens of millions of U.S. borrowers collectively owe $1.57 trillion in student loans, making them the third-largest form of consumer debt after mortgages and auto loans. This student loan debt is having a profound and far-reaching impact on young adults, according to the Morning Consult survey of more than 500 people ages 18-39 with student loans. The data reinforce the need for workplace programs that help tackle the student debt crisis. In fact, 94% of young adults with student debt expressed interest in an employer-provided 401(k) contribution as they pay off their school loans. Other key findings among those surveyed: 86% are concerned about having to resume federal student loan payments this month. 63% didn't pay their federal student loans at all during the three-year pause. And for 46%, student loans have impacted how much they contribute to their retirement plans. Among those whose retirement savings has been impacted by student loan debt: 86% have reduced the amount of money they contribute to their retirement account. 55% stopped contributing to their retirement plan. And 44% have withdrawn money from their retirement account. ""As the number of people with student loans grows, employees will increasingly be looking for companies to offer student loan repayment solutions that help them forge their financial futures,"" said Stacey MacPhetres, senior director, Education Finance, Bright Horizons EdAssist Solutions. ""This is a workplace benefit that employers need to seriously consider if they want to attract and retain key talent."" AN EMPLOYEE'S PERSPECTIVEWhen Cynthia Chan, a supply chain logistics planner in Abbott's vascular business, was job hunting, Freedom 2 Save was one of the factors that drew her to the company. ""I accumulated about $15,000 in student debt after earning my master's degree in chemical engineering and had no idea how I'd be able to pay my loans and save money for my future,"" said Chan. ""Freedom 2 Save lifted that weight off my shoulders. I've paid off nearly $5,000 while also saving for retirement, and can now see a time in the near future when I'll be free of this debt.""  For those who choose to take advantage of Abbott's innovative program like Chan, here's what it could look like: Employees who join Abbott in their early 20s with starting annual pay of $70,000 and take advantage of this program could see $48,000 accumulate in their 401(k) accounts after 10 years, assuming a 5% annual return and yearly merit pay increases of 2% — without any 401(k) contribution of their own. That amount could be worth hundreds of thousands of dollars in additional retirement savings by age 60. ""Our people have invested a lot in their education, and we don't want that to keep them from saving while they're still young,"" said Moreland. ""We encourage other companies to download our blueprint and join us in this effort. Together we can help employees take on student loans and savings."" About Freedom 2 Save:Through Freedom 2 Save, employees who are eligible for the company's 401(k) and who apply at least 2% of their eligible salary toward paying down a qualifying student loan will receive a 5% company contribution into their Abbott 401(k) annually. Employees don't have to put any money into their 401(k) to get this company contribution. Abbott was named to Fortune magazine's 2023 ""Change the World"" list for Freedom 2 Save, and the company was recognized by Pensions & Investments with an Innovation Award for the program. Freedom 2 Save was also featured in an essay in the book ""The Future of Building Wealth: Brief Essays on the Best Ideas to Build Wealth — for Everyone,"" published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis in partnership with the Aspen Institute's Financial Security Program. About the SECURE 2.0 Act:Thanks to a provision in the SECURE 2.0 Act that was inspired by Freedom 2 Save, employers will be able to match student loan payments made by their employees with tax-advantaged contributions into their retirement accounts starting in January 2024. Morning Consult Methodology:The total sample size was 501 U.S. adults aged 18-39 who have continued with some form of education after high school, have existing student loan debt and live in a major U.S. market. The responding sample is weighted to the profile of the sample definition to provide a representative reporting sample. Interviews were conducted online in September 2023.

8,"Abbott's new investigational drug-eluting Esprit BTK (below-the-knee) resorbable scaffold is made of naturally dissolving material that disappears over time after it's opened a clogged artery There is a significant need for more treatments: there are currently no drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons or bare-metal stents approved for below the knee (BTK) use in the U.S. Abbott's landmark LIFE-BTK randomized clinical trial met its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints, demonstrating that Esprit BTK offers significant advancements in opening and keeping blocked arteries below-the-knee open compared to the standard of care, balloon angioplasty SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Abbott (NYSE: ABT) today announced late-breaking data from the LIFE-BTK clinical trial evaluating the Esprit™ BTK Everolimus Eluting Resorbable Scaffold System (Esprit BTK) in people with chronic limb-threatening ischemia (CLTI). CLTI is a severe stage of peripheral artery disease (PAD) due to advanced arterial blockage in the lower extremities. The LIFE-BTK trial met both of its primary safety and effectiveness endpoints, demonstrating that Esprit BTK reduces disease progression and helps improve medical outcomes compared to the current standard of care, balloon angioplasty. Data from LIFE-BTK was presented as a late-breaking clinical trial at the 35th Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics (TCT) Conference in San Francisco and simultaneously published in the New England Journal of Medicine. ""Millions of people suffer from PAD. Yet, in the United States, there are currently no approved drug-eluting stents, drug-coated balloons or bare-metal stents available for use below-the-knee,"" said Brian DeRubertis, MD, FACS, New York Presbyterian-Weill Cornell Medical Center, and one of the principal investigators in the trial. ""This underscores a pressing and substantial need for improved treatment options for people with CLTI and PAD. Results from the LIFE-BTK trial highlight the efficacy of Esprit BTK and its potential to deliver significant benefits in terms of opening blocked arteries below-the-knee and providing sustained treatment over time."" More than 200 million people worldwide have PAD with nearly 11% affected by CLTI1,2, a severe form of PAD. In these people, blocked vessels impair blood flow to the lower extremities, often leading to severe pain, non-healing wounds, and, in some cases, the need for limb amputation. Balloon angioplasty, a procedure in which a small balloon is inserted into the artery to open the blockage, is currently one of the approved procedures for people in the U.S. with CLTI. However, in many instances, the vessels become blocked again over time following balloon angioplasty, requiring additional treatment. Abbott's Esprit BTK is a drug-eluting resorbable scaffold comprised of materials similar to dissolving sutures. Unlike metal stents, Esprit BTK is not a permanent implant, as blocked vessels only need support for a few months after the blockage is cleared. At that point, the vessel can stay open on its own, which is why Esprit BTK is designed to serve a temporary, yet crucial role. The LIFE-BTK trial enrolled 261 people worldwide. The study aimed to investigate whether Esprit BTK could offer greater benefits than the current option of balloon angioplasty to open blocked arteries in the leg and to keep the arteries open. The trial's primary efficacy endpoint evaluated primary patency plus limb salvage (the ability of the vessel to stay open, and increasing the time until another intervention is needed). The trial met the efficacy endpoint and showed that Esprit BTK is superior to balloon angioplasty in lowering the risk of total obstruction of the target vessel, narrowing of the target lesion, major amputation and repeat interventions of the target lesion. The primary safety endpoint evaluating freedom from above-the-ankle amputation, major reintervention at six-months and death within 30-days showed that Esprit BTK was non-inferior (similar performance) to balloon angioplasty. Results of the one-year LIFE-BTK clinical trial showed: Esprit BTK had a significantly greater freedom from the primary efficacy clinical events of 74.5 vs 43.7% (balloon angioplasty) for people with CLTI. The trial's powered secondary endpoints revealed that Esprit BTK was superior to balloon angioplasty at reducing vessel re-narrowing (25.8% improvement) and sustaining openness of the vessels (14.2% improvement). ""The LIFE-BTK trial data underscores the profound impact that Esprit BTK could have for millions with PAD,"" said Jennifer Jones-McMeans, divisional vice president of global clinical affairs at Abbott's vascular business. ""With angioplasty, multiple interventions are all too common. The results from this trial demonstrate a compelling and meaningful development in clinical outcomes, ultimately helping people have less adverse events and reinterventions, enhancing their quality of life."" Based on the strength of the LIFE-BTK trial results, Abbott intends to submit the Esprit BTK Everolimus Eluting Resorbable Scaffold System for review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

9,"NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / October 25, 2023 / Abbott: We think so. We're working hard to create new ways for you to understand your health. Abbott Right now, someone, somewhere, just created something no one else has thought of before. Human civilization is advancing in ways our ancestors could never have dreamed. It's a great time to be alive. But it doesn't always feel that way, does it? Just look at how we treat our health. Is our high-tech society truly helping us understand it? At an individual level? The promise of technology still feels unfulfilled when it comes to the thing that matters most: your health. Right now, a car can tell you exactly what's wrong with it, and maybe even drive itself to the mechanic. But can you say the same when you wake up feeling sick, or even just ""off""? Sometimes it seems like the world has prioritized machines over humans. There's something fundamentally unfair about that. So let's change it. Abbott is working hard to bring health and technology together. If we can give people a clearer picture and their doctors more information, we can make health technology the most helpful technology of all. Let's Put the Power of Health in Your Hands As a first step, let's put more people in control of managing their health. Let's give them what Mila Clarke has: data about her glucose level available minute by minute to help manage her diabetes. Clarke went on an odyssey to find more information about her type 2 diabetes. Our FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitors helped deliver it. From there, hard data started revealing the health answers she'd been seeking. ""I like being able to personalize based on my knowledge of my body, and I love meeting my own goals,"" Clarke said. Connected devices, biowearables, next-generation diagnostics - these technologies exist. As Clarke's example shows, they're helping people, and we're working every day to make them better for all. Let's Advance Better Health for More People Wouldn't it be nice - as you're on the go, go, go - if care could always be close at hand? Right now, for people living with Parkinson's Disease, that's no pipe dream. Our Neurosphere™ Virtual Clinic can connect them with their medical team to deliver therapy, instantly and securely, over Wi-Fi. Just ask Craig Overman.1 At one point, he was consistently driving 90 minutes each way to see a neurologist - and it was taking him five-and-a-half hours, each way, to get to his hospital consultations. Our Abbott Infinity™ DBS system helped change that math. Since receiving our deep brain stimulation device, he has been able to video chat with his doctor to receive remote therapy. As long as he can connect to the internet, he can find support. Stories like that should give us all hope that, one day soon, we'll be able to say, in earnest: ""It's a great time to be alive."" Explore how we're bringing health and technology together to put us all in greater control. 1 This story reflects one person's experience; not everyone will experience the same results.

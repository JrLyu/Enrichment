0,"Continues to expand its large infrastructure project capabilities in North America NEW YORK & TORONTO, October 26, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE: ACN) has acquired Comtech Group, a consulting and program management company for infrastructure projects in Canada and the United States. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231026024812/en/ Accenture has acquired Comtech Group, a consulting and program management company for infrastructure projects in Canada and the United States. Comtech Group was founded in 1994 and is headquartered in Toronto. Its clients are transportation, infrastructure, industrial manufacturing, building, and power and utility companies in the public and private sector. Comtech Group helps them deliver large, long-term infrastructure projects, such as urban transportation, automotive manufacturing processes, renewable and nuclear power, and building rehabilitation. The firm’s approx. 300 people bring a mix of consulting and project management expertise in construction management, facility and manufacturing engineering, and process control automation. Comtech Group has offices in Canada and the United States. The move follows Accenture’s recent acquisition of Anser Advisory, a leading advisory and management company for infrastructure projects in the United States, which has bolstered Accenture’s capital projects capabilities in North America. With Comtech Group, Accenture is now expanding its capital projects capabilities in Canada. These capabilities include project structuring, estimating and planning; digitization; monitoring the work being done; and assisting clients in managing and executing all phases of projects. Accenture also helps clients develop smarter, more efficient infrastructure for energy transition, transportation and production from the outset. Like Anser Advisory, Comtech Group joins Accenture’s digital engineering and manufacturing service, Industry X. Aaron Saint, North America lead for Industry X at Accenture, said: ""With Comtech Group, we will help our clients deliver mission-critical infrastructure projects on time and on budget. This requires industry expertise, ‘boots on the ground’ know-how, and increasingly, artificial intelligence (AI) and other digital capabilities to better plan, measure and monitor how these projects are executed. By combining Accenture and Comtech Group capabilities, we can better help deliver on our clients’ ambitious infrastructure programs."" David Morgenstern, president of Accenture in Canada, commented: ""We are expanding our capabilities at a time that Canada is committing to major infrastructure projects. Our country has deep roots in manufacturing, process and engineering industries. We are also home to leading organizations in AI, automation and robotics. Comtech Group will enhance our ability to bring value and productivity to clients in this evolving landscape."" Hugo Blasutta, president and CEO of Comtech Group, said: ""Comtech Group has an established track record supporting some of Canada’s most complex, large-scale infrastructure programs. As part of Accenture, we can deliver our proven solutions to even more clients in more industries. We are excited about Accenture’s commitment to innovation as shown in its recent $3 billion investment in AI. Joining this world-leading organization will also offer exciting new opportunities to our people."" Other acquisitions Accenture has made to support its clients’ infrastructure projects include Eclipse Automation, a provider of customized manufacturing automation and robotics solutions headquartered in Cambridge, Canada; Advoco, a US-based asset management services provider; ATI Solutions Group, an Australian consulting service provider to the mining, energy and rail industries; and umlaut, a global engineering services provider, headquartered in Germany.

1,"Good morning! 2023 has been a big year for AI. 2024 will be even bigger, and HR leaders are preparing for it. Of the 220 HR executives surveyed by Accenture last month, 97% intend to increase their technology spend in 2024, a 7% increase from 2023. Data and AI are the highest priority tech investments, with 79% of CHROs planning to invest in these areas next year, a 10% jump from this year. HR leaders are generally optimistic about AI. The majority of respondents say the technology will enhance productivity by automating routine tasks, enable increased focus on creative and innovative tasks, and improve job satisfaction by, again, reducing time spent on mundane tasks. About half say it will allow employees to engage in more meaningful work. All surveyed CHROs report already implementing some form of generative AI training in their organization. Seventy-four percent say they provide training on effectively using generative AI, and 56% plan to offer academic partnerships that provide AI skills training next year. Accenture is one of them. The professional services firm recently announced a three-year, $3 billion investment in AI that will double its AI talent to 80,000. For Allison Horn, Accenture’s global head of talent, the company's survey results provide a sigh of relief that her peers are also investing in the novel technology. “It's reassuring. This is game-changing in a really good, positive, energy-producing way,” she says. “Generative AI is really going to get rid of some of the mundane work and get us to the parts of work that we all enjoy more.” Interestingly, though, the top AI investment priority for HR leaders isn't in their function. Rather, it's in customer service (56%), followed by HR (45%), and finance (44%). That differs from CEOs' AI investment priorities. Of the 429 CEOs polled, the top use cases for generative AI are in the supply chain, manufacturing, and customer service, while HR is the lowest priority. It may surprise some that HR isn’t a top focus for chief executives or even their people ops leaders, but both functions agree that customer service is an area that will see quicker ROI in improving job quality. “When you see something like what generative AI can produce for things like customer service and call centers, it's an obvious value case,” says Horn. “And it's also one that usually has scale...If you're talking about something like call centers, [that’s] hundreds or thousands of people. So you can start to see this value very quickly.” Paige McGlauflinpaige.mcglauflin@fortune.com@paidion This story was originally featured on Fortune.com"
2,"Companies with the most resilient engineering, supply, production and operations achieved 3.6% additional annual revenue growth amid disruptions NEW YORK, October 26, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Companies are ramping up regional suppliers and production facilities to become less vulnerable to disruption, according to Accenture’s ""Resiliency in the making"" research. By 2026, 65% of companies intend to buy most key items from regional suppliers, up from 38% today. Even more organizations (85%) plan to produce and sell most of their products in the same region by 2026, almost doubling from 43% today. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231026182114/en/ The missed growth opportunity: Disruption drove $1.6 trillion in missed annual revenue growth. (Graphic: Business Wire) According to the report, regional sourcing and production are important to becoming less vulnerable to disruption, but not enough to reach sustained resiliency. Companies must also increase their digital maturity. They need to invest in data, AI and solutions like digital twins. Having more mature capabilities in these areas helps companies build reconfigurable supply chains and autonomous production. These capabilities also enable dynamic, sustainable product development and support decentralized, real-time decision-making at the frontlines of operations. Disruptive events have surged in recent years, from geopolitical shifts and extreme weather to technology breakthroughs and material and talent shortages. Few businesses sustained their resilience and long-term growth amid the turbulence: In 2021 and 2022, companies missed out on $1.6 trillion in additional annual revenues because their engineering, supply, production or operations were disrupted. At the same time, the 25% most resilient companies achieved 3.6% higher annual revenues than the 25% most vulnerable companies. Sef Tuma, global engineering and manufacturing lead, Accenture Industry X, said: ""Resiliency has become an opportunity for growth, not just a strategy for survival. Taking advantage of this opportunity requires companies to drive the digitization of engineering, supply, production and operations processes. Solutions like digital twins and technologies like generative AI can help companies adapt faster to sudden changes and take data-driven, real-time actions."" On average, companies are investing $1 billion in 2023 to digitize, automate and relocate supply and production facilities, which is expected to increase to at least $2.5 billion in 2026, according to the report. Sunita Suryanarayan, global supply chain and operations resiliency lead at Accenture, commented: ""When disruption struck, many companies quickly applied short-term fixes to their complex global production and supply networks. These networks had been designed for cost efficiency and just-in-time deliveries. Now is the time to strategically redesign them for multi-sourcing, without creating unwieldy silos or new bottlenecks, and make them more transparent and agile with data and AI to drive sustained resiliency."" Sustained resiliency is still a distant prospect for many companies. As part of the research, Accenture developed a model to measure engineering, supply, production and operations resiliency on a 0-100 scale. On average, companies achieved a score of only 56. The report recommends three areas companies should focus on to increase their resiliency: Visibility. Companies should make supply chains and production processes more predictable and autonomous. For example, smart end-to-end control towers monitor processes and analyze different scenarios in real time to detect and correct issues early on. Today, only 11% have near real-time alerting; 78% need at least a week to fully understand the impact. Resiliency in design. Moving activities earlier in the development process allows companies to get products, processes and ways of working right the first time. For example, digital twins – digital replicas of physical production facilities down to individual assembly lines and machines – allow product designers and engineers to identify and troubleshoot potential prototype issues or defects and iterate the design before production begins. New ways of working. Businesses must upskill the workforce in data, AI and other digital technologies so they can use predictive and visualization tools to make data-driven decisions at the frontlines of business. Today, only 17% of companies already have such a multi-skilled, digitally literate workforce; 68% plan to have one by 2026. Research Methodology The ""Resiliency in the making"" research is based on a survey conducted January – March 2023 among 1,230 senior executives across engineering, production, supply chain and operations. Respondents were from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, the United Kingdom and the United States. Their businesses were from the following industries: Aerospace and Defense, Automotive (OEMs), Automotive (ancillary, parts), Chemicals, Consumer Goods and Services, High-Tech, Industrial Equipment, Metal and Mining, Life Sciences, Oil and Gas (upstream and downstream) and Utilities.

7,"Investors looking for stocks in the Consulting Services sector might want to consider either CRA International (CRAI) or Accenture (ACN). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. Everyone has their own methods for finding great value opportunities, but our model includes pairing an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system with a strong Zacks Rank. The proven Zacks Rank puts an emphasis on earnings estimates and estimate revisions, while our Style Scores work to identify stocks with specific traits. CRA International and Accenture are sporting Zacks Ranks of #2 (Buy) and #3 (Hold), respectively, right now. Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CRAI likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than ACN has recently. But this is only part of the picture for value investors. Value investors also try to analyze a wide range of traditional figures and metrics to help determine whether a company is undervalued at its current share price levels. Our Value category grades stocks based on a number of key metrics, including the tried-and-true P/E ratio, the P/S ratio, earnings yield, and cash flow per share, as well as a variety of other fundamentals that value investors frequently use. CRAI currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.66, while ACN has a forward P/E of 24.47. We also note that CRAI has a PEG ratio of 1.36. This popular figure is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but the PEG ratio also considers a company's expected EPS growth rate. ACN currently has a PEG ratio of 2.58. Another notable valuation metric for CRAI is its P/B ratio of 3.35. The P/B is a method of comparing a stock's market value to its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, ACN has a P/B of 7.03. Based on these metrics and many more, CRAI holds a Value grade of B, while ACN has a Value grade of C. CRAI has seen stronger estimate revision activity and sports more attractive valuation metrics than ACN, so it seems like value investors will conclude that CRAI is the superior option right now.

8,"Leading marketers commit to accelerating change within their organizations by advancing representation, employment and accessible content in marketing and communications NEW YORK, October 25, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Accenture (NYSE: ACN), a leading global professional services company, and TD Bank, America's Most Convenient Bank®, today announced the formation of a cross-industry coalition of Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) and Chief Communications Officers (CCOs) powered by Disability:IN, a leading global organization driving disability inclusion and equality in business. The coalition aims to accelerate disability inclusion across the marketing and communications professions at large by delivering on six shared objectives. Coalition members include CMOs and CCOs from Disability:IN’s partner companies such as Adobe, Experian and SAP. This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231025629241/en/ Accenture and TD Bank today announced the formation of a cross-industry coalition of Chief Marketing Officers (CMOs) and Chief Communications Officers (CCOs) powered by Disability:IN, a leading global organization driving disability inclusion and equality in business. (Graphic: Business Wire) According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 1.3 billion people, or 16% of the global population, are living with disabilities. Accenture has studied the advantages of disability inclusion since 2018, and its soon-to-be-released study indicates that champions—companies that are going above and beyond in the disability inclusion space—are approximately 25% more likely to outperform their peers in productivity as measured by revenue per employee. However, many organizations seek guidance in adopting sustained disability inclusion practices within their own marketing and communications departments and within their marketing-related content. ""People with disabilities are the world's largest minority group, yet the opportunity to increase the representation of people with disabilities throughout marketing and communications is enormous. Bringing together this group of cross-industry marketing leaders has the power to shift the narrative around the way we, as a society, view disability,"" said Jill Houghton, president and CEO, Disability:IN. ""We want companies and brands to tap into this incredible market potential as well as employ more marketers and communicators with disabilities, whose lived experiences can help inform more inclusive and authentic messages that resonate with consumers."" Members of the coalition are committed to focusing on measurable and tangible actions related to six shared objectives across the marketing and communications profession and their respective organizations: Representation: Facilitating the accurate, affirming and authentic representation of people with disabilities throughout marketing and communications. Education: Fostering awareness and continued learning on accessibility and inclusion best practices in marketing and communications. Employment: Creating and sustaining marketing and communications employment opportunities for people with disabilities. Thought Leadership: Acting as thought leaders in this space to elevate the conversation on disability inclusion into the mainstream. Accessibility Content: Developing strategies for advancing accessible content in marketing and communications. Community: Amplifying and expanding coalition membership, as well as creating an open community of progress to share and learn about best and evolving practices. Under the guidance of Disability:IN, the coalition’s agenda and activities will be directed by coalition co-chairs Jill Kramer, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer of Accenture and John Pluhowski, Chief Communications Officer of TD Bank, N.A. Coalition members and their teams will regularly convene to advance the six shared objectives, including at the annual Disability:IN Global Conference & Expo in July, to share progress on workstreams, learnings from their organization’s disability inclusion efforts and to analyze initiatives and trends focused on disability inclusion in marketing and communications. ""Inclusion and diversity are part of Accenture’s DNA, and it’s also close to my heart. Being able to unite our people to further advance disability inclusion within our own walls and accelerate representation of persons with disabilities and the sustained creation of accessible content for the industry at large is one of my top priorities this year,"" said Jill Kramer, Chief Marketing and Communications Officer, Accenture. ""This is also just the beginning, as we’re inviting every brand and every marketer to join us on this journey, as together we’ll go further."" ""At TD Bank, our purpose is to enrich lives and build more inclusive tomorrows, not for some but for everyone,"" said John Pluhowski, Chief Communications Officer, TD Bank, N.A. and Disability:IN Board member. ""As marketers and communicators, we experience first-hand every day the power of collaboration and the creativity that results from joining forces. Striving to make content more accessible across industries is imperative, and we're committed as a coalition to delivering on this ambitious goal.""

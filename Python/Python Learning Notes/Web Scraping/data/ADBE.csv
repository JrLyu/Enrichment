1,"Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has had a rough week with its share price down 7.5%. But if you pay close attention, you might gather that its strong financials could mean that the stock could potentially see an increase in value in the long-term, given how markets usually reward companies with good financial health. Specifically, we decided to study Adobe's  ROE in this article. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In short, ROE shows the profit each dollar generates with respect to its shareholder investments.  Check out our latest analysis for Adobe  The formula for ROE is: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Adobe is: 32% = US$5.1b ÷ US$16b (Based on the trailing twelve months to September 2023). The 'return' is the income the business earned over the last year. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.32. Thus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes. To begin with, Adobe has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 9.8% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Adobe was able to see a decent net income growth of 14% over the last five years. Next, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Adobe's reported growth was lower than the industry growth of 18% over the last few years, which is not something we like to see. The basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. What investors need to determine next is if the expected earnings growth, or the lack of it, is already built into the share price. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. Has the market priced in the future outlook for ADBE? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.  Adobe doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen. Overall, we are quite pleased with Adobe's performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. As a result, the decent growth in its earnings is not surprising. On studying current analyst estimates, we found that analysts expect the company to continue its recent growth streak.

4,"Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a growth stock that can live up to its true potential can be a tough task. That's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss. However, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects. Our proprietary system currently recommends Adobe Systems (ADBE) as one such stock. This company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank. Research shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And returns are even better for stocks that possess the combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). While there are numerous reasons why the stock of this software maker is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below: Earnings Growth Earnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration. While the historical EPS growth rate for Adobe is 19.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 16.2% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 11.6%. Impressive Asset Utilization Ratio Asset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric exhibits how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales. Right now, Adobe has an S/TA ratio of 0.68, which means that the company gets $0.68 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.48, it can be said that the company is more efficient. In addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Adobe looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 10% this year versus the industry average of 4.5%. Promising Earnings Estimate Revisions Beyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements. The current-year earnings estimates for Adobe have been revising upward. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.1% over the past month. Bottom Line While the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Adobe a Zacks Rank #2 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. This combination positions Adobe well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.

The firm sees an improved outlook following the company's stronger than expected fiscal Q1 results. Oppenheimer upgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Outperform from Perform with a $660 price target. The firm sees strengthening business momentum, a favorable outlook for fiscal 2024, and ""durable growth"" for Adobe based on positive fundamental trends and its top position in software for the generative artificial intelligence opportunity gleaned from the firm's customer and industry surveys. DA Davidson also upgraded Adobe to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $640, up from $500. Guggenheim upgraded Akamai Technologies (AKAM) to Neutral from Sell without a price target. The firm sees potential upside to current 2024 Street estimates, which the firm believes creates a more balanced risk/reward scenario for the shares. Evercore ISI upgraded Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) to Outperform from In Line with a $100 price target. The firm says the regulatory overhang, uncertainty about 2024 growth, and upside to near-term estimates creates an attractive entry point for the shares. Northland upgraded Nextracker (NXT) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $45 price target. The firm expects the stock to rise further as the merger arbitrage bets settle in and the stock begins being driven by fundamentals. Top 5 Downgrades: Jefferies downgraded Bath & Body Works (BBWI) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $30, down from $45. The firm sees limited growth opportunities for the company after its data across social, foot traffic, and market share suggested a slowing of trends. KeyBanc downgraded Thermo Fisher (TMO) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. During the earnings call, Thermo provided ""a lot of moving parts"" with its 2024 macro view of zero or low-single-digit industry decline and its 3% growth goal, the firm tells investors in a research note. BofA downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $70, down from $87, after the company reported Q3 core revenue growth of 2.5% that was below the firm's estimate and prior guidance of 3.5%-4.5% year-over-year growth.

The firm thinks Paycom is well positioned to continue gaining share with ""a leading SaaS offering and a highly efficient model."" BofA initiated coverage of Paylocity (PCTY) with a Neutral rating and $210 price target. While stating that fundamentals ""appear attractive,"" the firm also notes that new customer adds slowed in FY23 despite an increase in sales and marketing costs, which may suggest a slowdown in margin progression in the near-term. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Procore Technologies (PCOR) with an Outperform rating and $80 price target. With a strong core business in project management, multiple drivers to expand logos, a long-term platform vision to capture more workflows, and margins approaching an inflection to sustained breakeven over the coming year, estimates have ""upward tension,"" the firm tells investors in a research note. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Rocket Lab (RKLB) with an Overweight rating and $6 price target. The firm believes the company benefits from a ""proven and successful"" launch track record, diversified and recurring customer base, and multiple launch complexes with vertical integration. RBC Capital initiated coverage of 4D Molecular (FDMT) with an Outperform rating and $25 price target. The shares trading close to cash ""creates an attractive buying opportunity"" given the company's differentiated platform tailoring gene therapy to specific tissue, the firm says."

7,"Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst picks you may have missed since yesterday: upgrades at Microsoft, Adobe, Snap, and Live Nation Entertainment. InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline. Oppenheimer and DA Davidson both upgraded Adobe Systems (NASDAQ:ADBE) to buy-equivalent ratings. Oppenheimer stamped the stock with a $660 price target, about 25% higher than Wednesday's close. The analysts cited Adobe’s strengthening business momentum and a promising outlook for fiscal 2024 - as well as its dominant position in generative AI, confirmed by customer and industry surveys. They believe Adobe’s focus on R&D and its AI Firefly product strategy has reenergized its product offerings, placing “the company in a better position for durable growth from adding users and monetizing on its large install-base.” The analysts believe investors ""will be rewarded through yearend and next fiscal year as concerns on penetration, pricing tolerance, and generative AI weakening the competitive moat dissipates."" DA Davidson, along with its upgrade of Adobe, added the company to its ""Best-of-Breed Bison” list - a ""select group of long-term best in class companies with sustainable competitive moats"" - and raised the target by $140 to $640. The analysts said the addition to the ""Best-of-Breed Bison"" list was based, among other things, on ""its position as a market leader in a >$200B FY’24 TAM, robust & predictable revenue streams, sustainable competitive advantage, exceptional financials, a powerful brand, and a shareholder-oriented management team."" Shares were up fractionally to $522.96 in recent trading. HSBC upgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) to Buy from Hold and raised its price target to $413.00 from $347.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro. Shares closed with a 3% gain Wednesday after the tech giant reported its Q1 results that beat Wall Street estimates, driven by stronger growth in its Azure cloud unit. Although the stock surged over 6% immediately after the Q3 report went out, it then slightly retreated on a cautious outlook: According to CFO Amy Hood, Q2 revenue is expected to be around $60.9 billion (up or down $500 million), which is only in line with the guidance. HSBC writes, “With PC sales and gaming revenue inflecting and MSFT benefitting from a compelling AI product portfolio, we expect MSFT to outperform on revenue growth against the sector. The company has also been exhibiting good expense discipline, and operating margins are benefiting.” Shares were recently down 2.2% to $333.24. China Renaissance upgraded Snap (NYSE:SNAP) to Hold from Sell with a price target of $9.00 following the company's reported better-than-expected Q3 results earlier this week. While shares initially jumped as much as 20% in after-hours trading on Tuesday following the company’s Q3 report, they closed with more than a 5% loss the next day following cautious commentary during the earnings call, especially about a slowdown in ad spending affecting the company’s current quarter sales. Live Nation Entertainment (NYSE:LYV) shares rose more than 1% pre-market today after Evercore ISI upgraded the company to Outperform from In Line with a price target of $100.00. The analyst noted that regulatory challenges, uncertainty about 2024’s growth, and upside to near-term estimates create an attractive entry point for the stock. “Antitrust investigations are nothing new for Ticketmaster, and we don’t believe the current DOJ investigation poses meaningful risk to LYV equity at $78/share,” added the analysts. *** In fast-moving markets, every second counts - and InvestingPro subscribers are always one step ahead with lightning-quick updates.

9,"(Reuters) - Britain's competition regulator, on Wednesday, extended by eight weeks the deadline to complete its in-depth probe into Photoshop owner Adobe Inc's $20 billion buyout of cloud-based designer platform Figma, to February 2024. In July, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) launched an in-depth, or phase two, investigation into the deal after Adobe said it would not offer any concessions to ease the regulator's concerns. The CMA now has until Feb. 25 to conclude its investigation, compared to the earlier deadline of Dec. 27. The probe is being conducted by an inquiry group selected from independent experts. The CMA said the companies have made a number of detailed arguments related to its concerns around competition in product developments between the firms, their growth strategies and how it would impact their ability to expand into new markets. In September 2022, Adobe announced a cash-and-stock deal for Figma, the biggest buyout of a privately owned software startup. Figma's web-based collaborative platform for designs and brainstorming is widely popular among tech-based companies, including Zoom Video Communications, Airbnb Inc and Coinbase.

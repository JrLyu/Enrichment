To skip the detailed analysis of the energy industry, go directly to the 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to Analysts. Over the last few years, the energy industry has shown quite a lot of volatility due to several reasons, including but not limited to, a pandemic followed by tense geopolitical conditions. Fossil fuels were one of the most important commodities in the world up until 2012. After that, the installation of renewable energy electricity generation capacity has outpaced the fossil fuel plants. Over the last five years, the spending on renewable energy has also exceeded fossil fuel investments as the International Energy Agency estimates that total energy sector investments will reach around $2.8 trillion in 2023 and around $1.7 trillion of it will be spent on renewable energy. Fossil fuels were the favorite stocks among investors in 2022 as Big Oil was able to rack up around $200 billion in profits last year and paid around $110 billion to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks. However, the current year did not look favorably toward the oil and gas sector. In Q2, companies such as Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL) and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) reported 56% and 49% declines in profits, respectively. The third quarter was promising for global crude oil prices due to the production cuts by OPEC countries and hit record per barrel prices for the year. The price of Brent Crude oil averaged slightly above $80 in July, $86 in August, and $94 per barrel in September. Marathon Petroleum Corporation (NYSE:MPC) was one of the companies that benefited the most from the surge in oil prices and is also the fourth biggest gainer of the S&P 500 in the last three months. However, in the first week of October, the high per barrel prices led to a decline in demand as we previously predicted, and the U.S. crude oil experienced its biggest weekly loss since March. Despite these fluctuations in the oil price, the US Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts that Brent Crude oil per barrel price will average at around $84.09 and will be much higher in 2024 at $94.91. In the long run, the International Energy Agency (IEA) sees the fossil fuel demand drop by 25% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. The Institute of Energy Economics and Financial Analysis said in one of its reports that the oil and gas sector’s “fall has been long in the making.” It further added that the oil and gas sector covered around 29% of the S&P 500 in 1980 and is down to 5.3% today. The renewable energy sector faced some problems due to the inflationary pressures which led to higher borrowing rates and lower-than-expected investments. Even though the apprehension of inflation is still there, it is not as bad as last year. According to BloombergNEF data, global renewable energy investments were up 22% year-over-year in the first half of 2023 and reached $358 billion. The developed countries are transitioning toward renewable energy quicker than expected. In 2022, the US made $141 billion worth of investments in the sector and renewable energy accounted for 43% of the country’s global energy mix. France has also recently announced the fast-tracking of its renewable energy capacity and plans to double it by 2035. Bloomberg Law reported that the country is targeting an additional 140 to 175 gigawatts of renewable capacity by that time. According to an IEA report posted in December 2022, renewable energy is forecasted to account for 90% of global electricity expansion over the next 5 years, and by 2025, it will surpass coal to become the largest source of electricity generation. Furthermore, IEA Executive Director, Fatih Birol, said that the amount of renewables added to electricity systems in 2023 will break records. He further added: “The global energy crisis has shown renewables are critical for making energy supplies not just cleaner but also more secure and affordable – and governments are responding with efforts to deploy them faster. However, achieving stronger growth means addressing some key challenges. Policies need to adapt to changing market conditions, and we need to upgrade and expand power grids to ensure we can take full advantage of solar and wind’s huge potential.” Analysts are also fairly bullish on the renewable energy sector as most of the undervalued energy stocks according to analysts in this list are mostly focusing on renewable energy. Some of the best undervalued energy stocks according to analysts include Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE).

(NASDAQ:PLUG), and Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE). Massif Capital mentioned The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) second-quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:  “Currently, the portfolio has roughly 11% allocated across two utilities, The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) and Polaris Renewable Energy. In the case of both equities, we have experienced disappointing 2023 market results, and in the case of AES, it is the long-book’s worst performer YTD, dragging down the overall portfolio by -2.09%. Polaris contributed a positive return of 0.21%. These two positions represent investments in similar assets but very different businesses, which explains much of the divergence in this year’s results. In the case of AES, we have a heavily US-focused utility with significant exposure to regulated and unregulated markets and a significant commitment to building out renewable energy. The firm also has some exposure to electricity markets in South America and exposure to electricity storage markets in the form of its ownership stake in Fluence (FLNC). Despite being one of the larger US utilities, the firm has trailed the sector (as measured by the IXUTR Index) dramatically this year…” (Click here to read the full text) Average analyst price target as of Oct 23: $11.92 Average analyst price target upside: 53.41% TransAlta Corporation (NYSE:TAC) is a Canadian energy company that operates wind, hydro, solar, battery energy storage, and natural gas facilities.

(NYSE:BIP) is an infrastructure asset management company headquartered in Ontario, Canada. The company’s portfolio is quite diversified and spread across the world. However, the majority of the assets owned by the company operate in the energy sector. In April 2023, Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) agreed to acquire the intermodal freight containers’ lessor, Triton International Limited (NYSE:TRTN) for $13.3 billion in a cash and stock deal. The acquisition was completed on September 28, 2023 after the companies received all the necessary regulatory approvals. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) is not only an undervalued energy stock according to analysts, but also has a very attractive valuation. As of October 23, the company is trading at a trailing twelve-month price-to-earnings ratio of 3.11. Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ:PLUG), and Bloom Energy Corporation (NYSE:BE) are some of the best-undervalued energy stocks along with Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP). Emeth Value Capital made the following comment about Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP) in its Q2 2023 investor letter: “Brookfield Corporation has $7.6 billion invested through Brookfield Infrastructure Partners L.P. (NYSE:BIP), a publicly traded permanent capital vehicle that is one of the largest owners and operators of critical global infrastructure. The entity was demerged from Brookfield in 2008 and was seeded with interests in 1.2 million acres of timberlands in Canada and the United States and interests in 10,900 kilometers of electricity transmission assets in Chile, Brazil, and Canada. The oldest of these assets, Great Lakes Power Transmission Co., an electricity transmission system based in Ontario, was acquired by Brascan in 1982. Brookfield Infrastructure Partners has significantly enhanced the quality, scale, and diversity of its portfolio over the last fifteen years. The timber assets were fully divested, and rail networks, toll roads, diversified terminals, last-mile utilities, midstream energy, and digital infrastructure were added. The partnership now owns many of the world’s premier infrastructure assets, several of which were acquired for value during a dislocation. For example, in 2020 Brookfield Infrastructure Partners acquired a six percent ownership interest in Sabine Pass, the largest LNG export facility in the United States. The transaction occurred amid unprecedented lows in natural gas pricing and an oversupplied LNG market. The partnership paid $1 billion for its interest, which was funded with forty percent equity and sixty percent low cost debt. In 2022, Sabine Pass generated $2.5 billion in earnings, or approximately $120 million in earnings against Brookfield Infrastructure Partners’ $400 million equity investment, equating to a thirty percent cash on cash yield…” (Click here to read the full text)   Click to continue reading and see the 5 Best Undervalued Energy Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.   Suggested articles: 15 Countries with the Highest Rates of Lung Cancer Long Term Returns of ValueAct Capital’s Activist Targets 12 Best Penny Stocks to Buy Under $1 Disclosure.

1,"AES' estimated fair value is US$11.46 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity AES' US$13.83 share price signals that it might be 21% overvalued  The US$22.00 analyst price target for AES is 92% more than our estimate of fair value How far off is The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by taking the expected future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. Our analysis will employ the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward. We would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.  Check out our latest analysis for AES  We use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years. A DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate: 2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033  Levered FCF ($, Millions)  -US$574.0m US$123.0m US$243.0m US$346.0m US$426.2m US$498.1m US$560.2m US$612.6m US$656.7m US$694.1m Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Analyst x1 Est @ 23.18% Est @ 16.87% Est @ 12.46% Est @ 9.36% Est @ 7.20% Est @ 5.68%  Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.9%  -US$532 US$106 US$193 US$255 US$291 US$315 US$328 US$333 US$331 US$324 (""Est"" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$1.9b We now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.2%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.9%. Terminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$694m× (1 + 2.2%) ÷ (7.9%– 2.2%) = US$12b Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$12b÷ ( 1 + 7.9%)10= US$5.7b The total value, or equity value, is then the sum of the present value of the future cash flows, which in this case is US$7.7b. The last step is to then divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$13.8, the company appears slightly overvalued at the time of writing. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. We would point out that the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate and of course the actual cash flows. Part of investing is coming up with your own evaluation of a company's future performance, so try the calculation yourself and check your own assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at AES as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.9%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.155. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business. Strength Debt is well covered by earnings. Weakness Dividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Renewable Energy market. Opportunity Expected to breakeven next year. Has sufficient cash runway for more than 3 years based on current free cash flows. Good value based on P/S ratio compared to estimated Fair P/S ratio. Significant insider buying over the past 3 months. Threat Debt is not well covered by operating cash flow. Paying a dividend but company is unprofitable. Revenue is forecast to decrease over the next 2 years. Whilst important, the DCF calculation is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. It's not possible to obtain a foolproof valuation with a DCF model. Preferably you'd apply different cases and assumptions and see how they would impact the company's valuation. For instance, if the terminal value growth rate is adjusted slightly, it can dramatically alter the overall result. Can we work out why the company is trading at a premium to intrinsic value? For AES, there are three pertinent elements you should consider: Risks: We feel that you should assess the 2 warning signs for AES we've flagged before making an investment in the company.

5,"Investors in AES Corporation AES need to pay close attention to the stock based on moves in the options market lately. That is because the Nov 17, 2023 $29.00 Call had some of the highest implied volatility of all equity options today. Implied volatility shows how much movement the market is expecting in the future. Options with high levels of implied volatility suggest that investors in the underlying stocks are expecting a big move in one direction or the other. It could also mean there is an event coming up soon that may cause a big rally or a huge sell-off. However, implied volatility is only one piece of the puzzle when putting together an options trading strategy. Clearly, options traders are pricing in a big move for AES Corporation shares, but what is the fundamental picture for the company? Currently, AES Corporation is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) in the Utility - Electric Power industry that ranks in the Top 26% of our Zacks Industry Rank. Over the last 30 days, one analyst has increased the earnings estimate for the current quarter, while none have dropped their estimates. The net effect has taken our Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current quarter from 48 cents per share to 49 cents in that period.Given the way analysts feel about AES Corporation right now, this huge implied volatility could mean there’s a trade developing. Oftentimes, options traders look for options with high levels of implied volatility to sell premium. This is a strategy many seasoned traders use because it captures decay. At expiration, the hope for these traders is that the underlying stock does not move as much as originally expected. Check out the simple yet high-powered approach that Zacks Executive VP Kevin Matras has used to close recent double and triple-digit winners.

6,"Passive investing in an index fund is a good way to ensure your own returns roughly match the overall market. Active investors aim to buy stocks that vastly outperform the market - but in the process, they risk under-performance. Investors in The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) have tasted that bitter downside in the last year, as the share price dropped 50%. That's disappointing when you consider the market returned 18%. Even if you look out three years, the returns are still disappointing, with the share price down36% in that time. Shareholders have had an even rougher run lately, with the share price down 42% in the last 90 days. If the past week is anything to go by, investor sentiment for AES isn't positive, so let's see if there's a mismatch between fundamentals and the share price.  See our latest analysis for AES  In his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time. Unhappily, AES had to report a 4.6% decline in EPS over the last year. Readers should not this outcome was influenced by the impact of extraordinary items on EPS. In fact, it actually made a loss over the last twelve months. The share price decline of 50% is actually more than the EPS drop. Unsurprisingly, given the lack of EPS growth, the market seems to be more cautious about the stock. The company's earnings per share (over time) is depicted in the image below (click to see the exact numbers). It's good to see that there was some significant insider buying in the last three months. That's a positive. That said, we think earnings and revenue growth trends are even more important factors to consider. It might be well worthwhile taking a look at our free report on AES' earnings, revenue and cash flow. Investors in AES had a tough year, with a total loss of 49% (including dividends), against a market gain of about 18%. Even the share prices of good stocks drop sometimes, but we want to see improvements in the fundamental metrics of a business, before getting too interested. Regrettably, last year's performance caps off a bad run, with the shareholders facing a total loss of 0.5% per year over five years. We realise that Baron Rothschild has said investors should ""buy when there is blood on the streets"", but we caution that investors should first be sure they are buying a high quality business. While it is well worth considering the different impacts that market conditions can have on the share price, there are other factors that are even more important. Consider for instance, the ever-present spectre of investment risk.   We've identified 2 warning signs  with AES , and understanding them should be part of your investment process.

9,"Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst cuts you may have missed since yesterday: an Underperform initiation at Bernstein, and downgrades at AutoZone, The AES Corporation, and O'Reilly Automotive. InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline. Bernstein initiated coverage on Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) with an Underperform rating and a price target of $11.00. The firm highlighted several challenges for Paramount, including a decline in linear, limited scale in direct-to-consumer (DTC), and a weak balance sheet. “We are bearish versus consensus on PARA's affiliate fee and advertising revenues but bullish on their Licensing revenue. However, Licensing tailwind is insufficient to offset Linear decline,” commented Bernstein. While Paramount has demonstrated its ability to boost DTC subscriber numbers and revenue, without scale in content, Bernstein expects a high churn rate to persist and engagement to be low. AutoZone (NYSE:AZO) shares fell more than 1% pre-market today after Oppenheimer downgraded the company to Perform from Outperform with a price target of $2,600.00, as reported in real-time on InvestingPro. Last month, the company reported its Q4 results, with EPS of $46.46 and revenue of $5.69 billion coming in better than the consensus estimates. The AES Corporation (NYSE:AES) shares fell more than 1% pre-market today after UBS downgraded the company to Neutral from Buy and cut its price target to $13.00 from $22.00, citing concerns about rising interest rates and a slowdown in earnings in the Infrastructure segment, driven by coal shutdowns. Oppenheimer downgraded O’Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ:ORLY) to Perform from Outperform with a price target of $930.00.

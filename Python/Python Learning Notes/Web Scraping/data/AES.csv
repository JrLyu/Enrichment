I once called them after being tagged for money I didnt owe that I didnt have and thoroughly explained to them that I am not their babysitter and it is not my position to clean up their mess when they cant do their jobs.

The burden that these payments have brought on the lives of students and the absolute extent to which it has ruined lives is unfathomable. "

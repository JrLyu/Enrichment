0,"The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. HIG reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted operating earnings of $2.29 per share, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 17.4%. The bottom line rose 57.9% year over year. Operating revenues of HIG rose 10% year over year to $4,213 million in the quarter under review. The top line beat the consensus mark by a whisker. The quarterly results benefited from well-performing Commercial Lines and Group Benefits businesses. While the Commercial Lines unit benefited on the back of higher premiums written, the Group Benefits business gained from improved fully insured ongoing premiums and sound core earnings margin. However, the upside was partly offset by an increased expense level and poor performance in the Hartford Funds segment. The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | The Hartford Financial Services Group, Inc. Quote Net earned premiums of Hartford Financial amounted to $5,310 million, which improved 8.1% year over year in the third quarter but missed our estimate of $5,369.9 million. Net investment income rose 22.6% year over year to $597 million in the third quarter and surpassed our estimate of $497.6 million. The year-over-year growth was due to higher returns from the fixed-income portfolio. Net investment income witnessed year-over-year growth in all the segments. Total benefits, losses and expenses of $5,355 million increased 4% year over year in the quarter under review, lower than our estimate of $5,421 million. HIG reported a pretax income of $813 million, which jumped 88.2% year over year and surpassed our estimate of $734.4 million. The segment recorded revenues of $3,318 million in the third quarter, which rose 13.1% year over year. Core earnings rose 49.3% year over year to $542 million due to lower catastrophe losses, an increase in net favorable prior accident year development within core earnings and improved net investment income. Yet, the metric came higher than our estimate of $407.6 million. The underlying combined ratio of 87.8% improved 150 basis points (bps) year over year due to a decrease in the underlying loss and loss adjustment expense ratio. Revenues of $854 million grew 7.2% year over year in the third quarter. The segment reported a core loss of $8 million compared with the prior-year quarter’s core loss of $28 million. Higher severity of auto liability and physical damage dampened the metric. The underlying combined ratio deteriorated 310 bps year over year to 99% in the quarter under review. The segment’s revenues of $16 million improved 60% year over year in the third quarter. The segment reported revenues of $1,719 million in the quarter under review, which improved 8.5% year over year but missed our estimate of $1,724.5 million. Core earnings improved 45.3% year over year to $170 million due to improving fully insured ongoing premiums and better disability results. The metric surpassed our estimate of $140.7 million. The loss ratio was 70.2%, which improved 260 bps year over year due to a better mortality experience. Revenues of $248 million improved 0.4% year over year in the third quarter and came higher than our estimate of $236.5 million. Core earnings declined 4.3% year over year at $45 million but were higher than our estimate of $43.5 million. Improved net investment income in the unit was partly offset by reduced fee income net of variable expenses. The segment’s daily average assets under management decreased 1% year over year to $128.8 billion on the back of higher net outflows in the trailing 12 months. The segment’s revenues of $13 million improved 62.5% year over year but missed our estimate of $33.9 million. The unit reported a core loss of $52 million in the quarter under review, wider than the year-ago quarter’s loss of $37 million, attributable to higher expenses. Hartford Financial exited the third quarter with cash of $111 million, which decreased 51.5% from the figure at 2022-end. Total investments of $53.3 billion inched up 1.4% from the 2022-end level.

1,"Program Shines a Light on Childhood Cancer and Sickle Cell Disease during National Childhood Cancer and National Sickle Cell Awareness month and beyond Originally published on Aflac Newscenter COLUMBUS, GA / ACCESSWIRE / October 26, 2023 / Aflac, a leading provider of supplemental health insurance products in the U.S. and a proud supporter of families of children with cancer and blood disorders such as sickle cell disease, recently announced the culmination of its campaign to illuminate bridges and other landmarks across the country to commemorate National Childhood Cancer Awareness Month and National Sickle Cell Awareness Month. Aflac, a pioneer in cancer insurance coverage, has supported childhood cancer initiatives since 1995, having contributed more than $170 million to the cause. Throughout the month of September, bridges in Atlanta, GA; Buffalo, NY; Fort Wayne, IN; Nashville, TN; Minneapolis, MN; and other U.S. cities were lit by Aflac in gold and burgundy - the recognition colors for childhood cancer and sickle cell disease - in support of the children and families who show incredible courage in the face of life-altering diagnoses. ""For nearly three decades, Aflac has been committed to supporting medical professionals, nonprofit organizations, family members and others who care for children with cancer and blood disorders like sickle cell disease,"" Aflac U.S. President Virgil R. Miller said. ""Bridge to Brighter is an extension of Aflac's core company mission to bridge the gap for people and communities when they need us the most."" The bridge lightings are an expression of Aflac's Bridge to Brighter campaign, a monthlong effort to shine a bright light helping Americans to learn more about childhood cancer and sickle cell disease and how they can get involved to make a difference. In early September, Aflac launched a digital destination, The Bridge to Brighter, where visitors can hear and read stories about childhood cancer and sickle cell, spread the word to their communities, and ultimately take action, such as by registering as a bone marrow donor or making donations to the Aflac Cancer Center at give.choa.org. Primary sponsor of the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center of Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, much of the $170 million in financial support comes from independent sales agents and Aflac employees. Additionally, in 2018, Aflac created My Special Aflac Duck, a robotic companion that provides comfort and support to children, helps them express their emotions, and normalizes medical procedures. Over the past five years, Aflac has distributed more than 24,000 of these ducks free of charge to children above the age of three with cancer and sickle cell disease.

2,"AMERISAFE, Inc. AMSF reported third-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of 61 cents, which missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 4.7%. The bottom line declined 16.4% year over year. Operating revenues deteriorated 0.1% year over year to $74.8 million. The top line missed the consensus mark by 0.2%. The weak third-quarter earnings were caused by lower net premiums earned and higher expenses. An increased combined ratio indicates lower profitability. However, the negatives were partially offset by increased net investment income. AMERISAFE, Inc. price-consensus-eps-surprise-chart | AMERISAFE, Inc. Quote Net premiums earned by AMERISAFE amounted to $66.6 million, which decreased 1.7% year over year in the third quarter. The figure missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 0.7%. Net investment income of $8.1 million increased 16.1% year over year due to growing yields on fixed-income and cash securities. The figure beat the consensus estimate by 4%. Fees and other income declined 26% year over year and missed the consensus mark by 42.2%. AMERISAFE’s pre-tax underwriting profit of $6.3 million plunged 35.9% year over year. Total expenses increased 4.1% year over year to $60.3 million in the third quarter, attributable to higher underwriting and other operating costs and policyholder dividends. The net combined ratio of 90.6% increased from 85.4% a year ago and was higher than our estimate of 89.5% due to an increased net underwriting expense ratio. AMERISAFE exited the third quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $59.2 million, which decreased from $61.5 million at 2022-end. Total assets of $1,296.6 million increased from $1,269.3 million at 2022-end. Shareholders' equity rose from $317.4 million at 2022-end to $335.9 million in the third quarter.

3,"Wall Street expects a year-over-year increase in earnings on higher revenues when Trupanion (TRUP) reports results for the quarter ended September 2023. While this widely-known consensus outlook is important in gauging the company's earnings picture, a powerful factor that could impact its near-term stock price is how the actual results compare to these estimates. The earnings report, which is expected to be released on November 2, 2023, might help the stock move higher if these key numbers are better than expectations. On the other hand, if they miss, the stock may move lower. While management's discussion of business conditions on the earnings call will mostly determine the sustainability of the immediate price change and future earnings expectations, it's worth having a handicapping insight into the odds of a positive EPS surprise. Zacks Consensus Estimate This provider of medical insurance covering cats and dogs is expected to post quarterly loss of $0.31 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +3.1%. Revenues are expected to be $276.2 million, up 18.2% from the year-ago quarter. Estimate Revisions Trend The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 1.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. This is essentially a reflection of how the covering analysts have collectively reassessed their initial estimates over this period. Investors should keep in mind that an aggregate change may not always reflect the direction of estimate revisions by each of the covering analysts. Earnings Whisper Estimate revisions ahead of a company's earnings release offer clues to the business conditions for the period whose results are coming out. Our proprietary surprise prediction model -- the Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction) -- has this insight at its core. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a more recent version of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Thus, a positive or negative Earnings ESP reading theoretically indicates the likely deviation of the actual earnings from the consensus estimate. However, the model's predictive power is significant for positive ESP readings only. A positive Earnings ESP is a strong predictor of an earnings beat, particularly when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold). Our research shows that stocks with this combination produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time, and a solid Zacks Rank actually increases the predictive power of Earnings ESP. Please note that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss. Our research shows that it is difficult to predict an earnings beat with any degree of confidence for stocks with negative Earnings ESP readings and/or Zacks Rank of 4 (Sell) or 5 (Strong Sell). How Have the Numbers Shaped Up for Trupanion? For Trupanion, the Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, suggesting that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This has resulted in an Earnings ESP of +1.27%. On the other hand, the stock currently carries a Zacks Rank of #2. So, this combination indicates that Trupanion will most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate. Does Earnings Surprise History Hold Any Clue? Analysts often consider to what extent a company has been able to match consensus estimates in the past while calculating their estimates for its future earnings. So, it's worth taking a look at the surprise history for gauging its influence on the upcoming number. For the last reported quarter, it was expected that Trupanion would post a loss of $0.42 per share when it actually produced a loss of $0.33, delivering a surprise of +21.43%. Over the last four quarters, the company has beaten consensus EPS estimates two times. Bottom Line An earnings beat or miss may not be the sole basis for a stock moving higher or lower. Many stocks end up losing ground despite an earnings beat due to other factors that disappoint investors. Similarly, unforeseen catalysts help a number of stocks gain despite an earnings miss. That said, betting on stocks that are expected to beat earnings expectations does increase the odds of success. This is why it's worth checking a company's Earnings ESP and Zacks Rank ahead of its quarterly release. Make sure to utilize our Earnings ESP Filter to uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they've reported. Trupanion appears a compelling earnings-beat candidate. However, investors should pay attention to other factors too for betting on this stock or staying away from it ahead of its earnings release. An Industry Player's Expected Results Another stock from the Zacks Insurance - Accident and Health industry, Aflac (AFL), is soon expected to post earnings of $1.47 per share for the quarter ended September 2023. This estimate indicates a year-over-year change of +19.5%. Revenues for the quarter are expected to be $4.47 billion, down 7.4% from the year-ago quarter. The consensus EPS estimate for Aflac has been revised 1.1% higher over the last 30 days to the current level. However, a lower Most Accurate Estimate has resulted in an Earnings ESP of -1.87%. When combined with a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), this Earnings ESP makes it difficult to conclusively predict that Aflac will beat the consensus EPS estimate. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. Stay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.

4,"Amid recent market volatility and the 10-year Treasury Yield climbing over the last few weeks, investors may be more cautious of the stocks they are investing in. That being said, several dividend aristocrats are attractive and are currently top-rated Zacks stocks. More reassuring, stocks considered to be dividend aristocrats have increased their annual dividend payouts in each of the last 25 years providing investors with a steady source of income. For these top-rated Zacks dividend aristocrats, the combination of a strengthening outlook and reliable dividends is hard to overlook. This is especially true with much uncertainty in the stock market and broader economy at the moment. However, these dividend aristocrats are benefitting from strong industries that should help them outperform making now an ideal time to buy. Image Source: Wall Street Journal Energy Aristocrats We’ll start with a pair of oil and gas titans in Chevron CVX and Exxon Mobil XOM as both currently sport a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). In terms of their dividends, Chevron has raised its payout for 36 consecutive years with Exxon's at 40 years and counting. Even better, Chevron and Exxon both have dividend yields over 3% and well above the S&P 500’s 1.5% average. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Furthermore, their Oil and Gas-Integrated-International Industry is currently in the top 16% of over 250 Zacks industries. As integrated oil giants, Chevron and Exxon can certainly reap steeper profits amid higher oil prices and their strong post-pandemic price performances could resume with CVX soaring +121% over the last three years and XOM skyrocketing +225%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research To that point, WTI crude oil prices have been volatile over the last week but remain over $80 a barrel with earnings estimate revisions nicely up for Chevron and Exxon in the last 60 days. Plus, recent tensions in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas could mean another spike in oil prices could be right around the corner as Iran has already called for other Muslim nations to curtail oil supplied to the region in support of Palestine. Image Source: Yahoo Finance Financial Aristocrats Financials have attributed to a large sum of the recent volatility in broader markets but several of these equities have made the case for being oversold and happen to be dividend aristocrats. Making a compelling case for such is casualty insurance provider Cincinnati Financial CINF which currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Cincinnati Financial has raised its dividend for 61 consecutive years classifying the company as a ""dividend king"" as well with a current annual yield of 3.06%. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Trading more than 20% from its 52-week high of $130 a share seen last February, Cincinnati Financial‘s stock is down -4% YTD but still up +28% over the last three years. Buying the recent dip is very intriguing with Cincinnati Financial’s Insurance-Property and Casualty Industry in Zacks top 34%. Annual earnings estimates are slightly higher over the last quarter with Cincinnati Financial expecting double-digit percentage growth on its bottom line in fiscal 2023 and FY24. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Another viable option among financial aristocrats is Aflac AFL which also sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and its Zacks Insurance-Accident and Health Industry is in the top 5% of all Zacks industries. Aflac has raised its dividend for 41 consecutive years with a current yield of 2.18% which slightly trails its industry average but tops the benchmark. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research The voluntary supplemental and life insurance behemoth has seen its stock hold up while other financials have cratered. Up a respectable +8% in 2023, Aflac’s stock recently hit 52-week highs of $82 a share last Tuesday before cooling off over the last few trading sessions. Along with its reliable dividend, annual earnings estimates for FY23 and FY24 are modestly higher in the last 30 days with Aflac’s EPS now projected to jump 13% this year and rise another 3% next year to $6.19 per share. Image Source: Zacks Investment Research Bottom Line The trend of rising earnings estimates correlates with the notion that these top-rated dividend aristocrats are benefitting from their strong business environments. Now appears to be a good time to buy as their reliable dividends and strengthening outlooks are reassuring for investors amid recent market volatility.

5,"Aflac (AFL) is expected to deliver a year-over-year increase in earnings on lower revenues when it reports results for the quarter ended September 2023.

9,"Nearly 90% of employees reporting high levels of burnout also faced other mental health challenges over the past year COLUMBUS, Ga., Oct. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Employers across various U.S. industries and regions are struggling to meet their employees' health care benefits needs — and employee satisfaction, wellbeing and retention are at stake, according to the 13th annual Aflac WorkForces Report released by Aflac Incorporated, a leading provider of supplemental health insurance and products in the U.S. The Aflac WorkForces Report tracks the state of the American workplace among employees and employers, year over year, capturing trends, attitudes, needs and experiences in health care and benefits administration. The slow burn of burnout The nationally representative survey underscores employees' concerns about mental health — especially burnout. Employees want their employers to care about their overall wellbeing and provide resources to stay ahead of burnout, but the study shows their confidence is waning — causing some to consider other job opportunities. Consistent with 2022 survey findings, more than half (57%) of all American workers say they are currently experiencing at least moderate levels of burnout. The most significant culprit is workplace stress — with heavy workloads as the biggest stressor — and it's disproportionately affecting both women and younger workers. Other survey findings include: Employees' confidence in how much their employers care about them has declined significantly: 48% in 2023; 56% in 2022; 59% in 2021. The overwhelming majority (89%) of employees who report high levels of burnout also have experienced other mental health challenges over the past year, including anxiety, depression and trouble sleeping, among others. 67% of Gen Z and 64% of millennials say they are facing moderate to high levels of burnout. Women are vulnerable, too, with 75% reporting burnout at work as opposed to 58% of men. ""Survey results on mental health and wellbeing in the workplace are alarming and continue to be challenging, but employers can face these challenges head-on and turn them into opportunities,"" said Jeri Hawthorne, senior vice president, chief human resources officer, Aflac Incorporated. ""Offering benefits that include mental health tools and resources, in addition to work-life balance perks, such as flexible work schedules, can help with employee satisfaction, retention and recruitment."" A balancing act for employers The steady rise in benefits costs and looming concerns of increasing prices of everyday goods and services are causing employers to cautiously navigate balancing their benefits budgets, satisfying employees — and, more importantly than ever, retaining them. The study uncovered that 53% are at least somewhat likely to accept a position with lower pay but better benefits. ""The cost of benefits is creating a ripple effect for employers,"" said Hawthorne. ""They want to remain competitive by offering benefits their employees are looking for while staying budget conscious. They're also faced with retention pressure and tough decisions to push expenses to employees, such as increasing employee deductibles or employees' share of health insurance premiums."" The great divide in benefits satisfaction and understanding The gaps are widening between employers' perceptions and employees' lived experiences with benefits satisfaction and understanding, according to the study. Key survey findings: 78% of employers believe their employees are highly satisfied with their benefits, compared to only 59% of employees who express high satisfaction. 79% of employers think employees understand benefits costs well, while fewer than half (48%) of employees say they do. ""When employees do not fully understand the inner workings of their policies and health care costs, it's difficult for them to prepare for an unexpected medical event,"" said Hawthorne. ""It's important for employers to actively communicate about benefits year-round — not just during open enrollment periods."" Financial fragility, smarter choices Employees' stress and anxiety about their financial health are caused not only by rising costs, but also by the potential of unexpected medical expenses. This has led employees to spend less and save more over the last year, according to the survey. More employees have financial resources on hand to cover a medical emergency, compared to last year; however, the state of financial wellness among American workers — and their outlook on the economy — remain fragile. Key survey findings: 51% of employees have savings on hand for a medical bill — up from 45% in 2022 — but 50% can't afford more than $1,000 in out-of-pocket (OOP) medical expenses. 54% of employees say they could survive a month without a paycheck, down from 62% in 2022. 50% of employees think the economy is worse than it was a year ago; 30% indicate that they are in a worse financial position than they were a year ago. Financial instability disproportionately impacts Hispanic workers. Key survey findings: 66% of all Hispanic workers could not go more than a month without a paycheck — compared to 51% of non-Hispanic workers. 57% of Hispanic workers could not afford $1,000 in unexpected OOP health care-related costs, compared to 49% of non-Hispanic workers. When faced with an unexpected medical expense, Hispanic workers also would be more likely to have to rely on family or friends (29% vs. 24% of non-Hispanic workers) or seek a second job for supplemental income (26% vs. 18% of non-Hispanic workers). Hispanic workers are less likely than their non-Hispanic counterparts to be able to pull from a checking or savings account to cover unexpected medical expenses (43% vs. 53%). Meeting employees where they are in the digital space Survey responses show employees' needs are not being met when it comes to enrolling in and managing their benefits online. Most employers recognize the importance of having a benefits provider that offers a user-friendly, digital interface. A similar proportion of employees value the convenience of managing their benefits online. Key survey findings: 82% of employees overall — and 87% of millennials — think it's important to enroll in and manage their benefits online. 82% of employees stress the importance of being able to manage benefits online, yet 45% of employers do not offer the ability to enroll in benefits online. 64% of organizations offer online benefits management, down from 67% in 2022 and 79% in 2021. 8 in 10 employers indicate that it is very important for their benefits provider to be innovative and lead in digital technology. Nearly one-third of employees say they aren't comfortable working with AI to manage their benefits, whereas fewer employers (1 in 10) feel the same way. ""Employers have an opportunity to build benefits programs their employees need and make it easy to navigate and manage their options online. Leaning into benefits providers who excel in digital technology can make a big difference and increase employee satisfaction,"" said Hawthorne. Supplemental insurance helps provide financial security and boosts recruitment, retention Supplemental benefits that directly address employees' anxieties about the future can be a compelling solution. According to the survey, more than half of all employees express a high degree of interest in purchasing supplemental health insurance that helps cover serious illnesses or conditions — if they have family history. This interest is higher among younger generations than baby boomers and significantly higher among Hispanic workers (62%), compared to their non-Hispanic counterparts (50%). According to the survey, the majority of employees (88%) with supplemental insurance say those benefits provide an added layer of financial security, yet only 39% of employers indicate that they offer supplemental insurance options to their employees. Of employers who offer supplemental insurance to their employees, 80% believe these benefits help with recruitment, and 82% say they help with retention. The 2023-2024 Aflac WorkForces Report highlights the important role benefits programs play in employees' wellbeing and satisfaction. Supplemental insurance remains a core component of a comprehensive benefits package to help attract and retain employees. Employers will foster a more resilient workplace by understanding their employees' needs and offering resources for mental health and financial wellbeing while leveraging innovative technology.

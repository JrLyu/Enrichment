0,"The most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.Top 5 Upgrades:  HSBC upgraded Microsoft (MSFT) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $413, up from $347. The firm sees an improved outlook following the company's stronger than expected fiscal Q1 results. Oppenheimer upgraded Adobe (ADBE) to Outperform from Perform with a $660 price target. The firm sees strengthening business momentum, a favorable outlook for fiscal 2024, and ""durable growth"" for Adobe based on positive fundamental trends and its top position in software for the generative artificial intelligence opportunity gleaned from the firm's customer and industry surveys. DA Davidson also upgraded Adobe to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $640, up from $500. Guggenheim upgraded Akamai Technologies (AKAM) to Neutral from Sell without a price target. The firm sees potential upside to current 2024 Street estimates, which the firm believes creates a more balanced risk/reward scenario for the shares. Evercore ISI upgraded Live Nation Entertainment (LYV) to Outperform from In Line with a $100 price target. The firm says the regulatory overhang, uncertainty about 2024 growth, and upside to near-term estimates creates an attractive entry point for the shares. Northland upgraded Nextracker (NXT) to Outperform from Market Perform with a $45 price target. The firm expects the stock to rise further as the merger arbitrage bets settle in and the stock begins being driven by fundamentals. Top 5 Downgrades: Jefferies downgraded Bath & Body Works (BBWI) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $30, down from $45. The firm sees limited growth opportunities for the company after its data across social, foot traffic, and market share suggested a slowing of trends. KeyBanc downgraded Thermo Fisher (TMO) to Sector Weight from Overweight without a price target. During the earnings call, Thermo provided ""a lot of moving parts"" with its 2024 macro view of zero or low-single-digit industry decline and its 3% growth goal, the firm tells investors in a research note. BofA downgraded Fortive (FTV) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $70, down from $87, after the company reported Q3 core revenue growth of 2.5% that was below the firm's estimate and prior guidance of 3.5%-4.5% year-over-year growth. BofA downgraded F5 Networks (FFIV) to Underperform from Neutral with a price target of $160, down from $165. The firm expects revenue growth to remain muted, calling for it to be down 2% and up 4% over the next two years, respectively. Roth MKM downgraded MaxLinear (MXL) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $18, down from $35. The company reported revenue slightly behind consensus but guided another decline for Q4 below consensus growth expectations, the firm notes. Top 5 Initiations:  BofA initiated coverage of Paycom (PAYC) with a Buy rating and $330 price target. The firm thinks Paycom is well positioned to continue gaining share with ""a leading SaaS offering and a highly efficient model."" BofA initiated coverage of Paylocity (PCTY) with a Neutral rating and $210 price target. While stating that fundamentals ""appear attractive,"" the firm also notes that new customer adds slowed in FY23 despite an increase in sales and marketing costs, which may suggest a slowdown in margin progression in the near-term. BMO Capital initiated coverage of Procore Technologies (PCOR) with an Outperform rating and $80 price target. With a strong core business in project management, multiple drivers to expand logos, a long-term platform vision to capture more workflows, and margins approaching an inflection to sustained breakeven over the coming year, estimates have ""upward tension,"" the firm tells investors in a research note. Cantor Fitzgerald initiated coverage of Rocket Lab (RKLB) with an Overweight rating and $6 price target. The firm believes the company benefits from a ""proven and successful"" launch track record, diversified and recurring customer base, and multiple launch complexes with vertical integration. RBC Capital initiated coverage of 4D Molecular (FDMT) with an Outperform rating and $25 price target. The shares trading close to cash ""creates an attractive buying opportunity"" given the company's differentiated platform tailoring gene therapy to specific tissue, the firm says."
1,"Prolexic cloud scrubbing centers in Toronto and Montreal enhance protection from DDoS attacks. CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Oct. 25, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Akamai Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKAM), the cloud company that powers and protects life online, today announced the launch of its latest Akamai Prolexic scrubbing centers in Toronto and Montreal. The new centers offer world-class distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection to regional and global organizations, government institutions, and critical public infrastructure. This announcement is part of Akamai's strategy to strengthen its Prolexic DDoS protection platform with a network of cloud scrubbing centers across 32 global metropolitan areas, offering a staggering 20+ Tbps of dedicated defense capacity. To put this in perspective: Even the largest DDoS attacks make up less than 10% of the defense capacity offered by the Prolexic platform. The local scrubbing centers in Toronto and Montreal deliver several additional benefits to customers in the region, including: Minimizing latency and maximizing network performance Optimizing operational costs related to network traffic redirection Enhancing visibility into and control over the region-specific patterns of DDoS attacks Canada has experienced a significant increase in the scale and sophistication of cyberthreats in the past three years. According to a recent survey, more than two-thirds of Canadian business executives believe that cybercrime will be their most significant threat in the coming year. In September 2023, the websites of several Canadian provincial governments were brought down by DDoS attacks. Additionally, DDoS attacks on the Canada Border Services Agency disrupted the operations of check-in kiosks and electronic gates across multiple airports. The recent spate of DDoS attacks resulted in an alert for IT professionals and managers from the Canadian Centre for Cyber Security. DDoS has become a relatively inexpensive, but highly effective, cyberattack tool for motivated cybercriminals, state-sponsored hackers, and other malicious actors, who often use such attacks as a smoke screen to then launch triple extortion attacks. To offer the most comprehensive DDoS protection, Akamai recently announced the launch of Akamai Prolexic On-Prem and Akamai Prolexic Hybrid options, which empower customers in the region to leverage the combined benefits of the ultra-low latency and automated surgical DDoS mitigation of on-prem appliances while still getting the scale of the Prolexic cloud to stop volumetric DDoS attacks. ""Over the past two years, DDoS attacks have become bigger, highly sophisticated, and multi-vector in nature. The Akamai Prolexic platform offers comprehensive on-prem, cloud, or hybrid DDoS protection to protect our customers' digital infrastructure and internet-facing assets,"" said Sean Lyons, Senior Vice President and General Manager of Infrastructure Security at Akamai. ""The new scrubbing centers in Toronto and Montreal bring DDoS protection even closer to our Canadian customers, allowing Akamai to deliver world-class security without impacting latency and end-user experience.""

5,"While digital connectivity has revolutionized society and sparked opportunities through the introduction of new industries, it also yields nefarious activities, thus warranting a closer look at the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now. Given the proliferation of digital crimes, targeting security solutions almost represents a no-brainer. First, investors must realize just how bad the situation has become. Worryingly, experts in the field reported that the global cost of cybercrime came out to more than $8 trillion last year. By the end of this year, the figure could exceed $11 trillion. That’s a massive wake-up call that utterly incentivizes the consideration of the top cybersecurity stocks. Second, we’re seeing the devastation of the digital crime wave accelerate to unprecedented levels. Perhaps most notably, Clorox (NYSE:CLX) recently revealed the extent of the damage it suffered from a digital breach earlier this year. Conspicuously, the damage inflicted by ransomware clocks in at 57X more destructive in 2021 than in 2015. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips On that note, below are the best cybersecurity stocks to buy in October 2023. Source: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com Specializing in providing global content delivery network (CDN) services, Akamai (NASDAQ:AKAM) also specializes in cybersecurity and cloud-based solutions. It’s a major player among the best cybersecurity stocks to buy thanks to its influence on web traffic visibility. Given Akamai’s CDN footprint, it handles a large portion of the world’s web traffic. Thus, it’s able to identify and mitigate new threats quickly. In addition, Akamai provides distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack protection, which can overwhelm websites and online services. As well, the company offers a web application firewall (WAF) that protects web applications from common attacks by monitoring and filtering traffic and blocking malicious incoming traffic. Thanks to its vitality, investors have poured into AKAM, sending it up nearly 27% on a year-to-date basis. However, AKAM still trades at 16.8x forward earnings, lower than the sector median of 22x. Analysts peg AKAM as a consensus moderate buy with a $111.54 target, implying about 4% upside. Still, that could be on the low side given the vast importance of the underlying business. Source: Shutterstock An identity and access management firm, Okta (NASDAQ:OKTA) ranks among the top cybersecurity stocks thanks to its authentication protocols. Through Okta, enterprise-level clients can manage and secure user authentication into various applications. Also, developers can build these controls for their platforms, web services, and devices. All this occurs under a unified, cloud-based umbrella that effectively allows companies to connect the right folks to the right technologies. In addition, Okta represents a leader in multi-factor authentication (MFA). Under this protocol, users must provide multiple forms of identification before gaining access to protected functions. Therefore, this security measure helps impede unauthorized entities from gaining access to sensitive information, even if these nefarious agents manage to crack passwords. Now, nothing in life is free and with that, it must be said that OKTA trades at a forward multiple of nearly 52X. That ranks worse than 81% of its peers, per investment data aggregator Gurufocus. However, for that premium, investors enjoy an impressive three-year revenue growth rate of 33%. Analysts rate OKTA a consensus moderate buy with a $93.17 target, implying 8% growth potential. Source: Shutterstock An information security specialist, CyberArk Software (NASDAQ:CYBR) also focuses on identity management. Per its public profile, CyberArk mainly serves the financial services, energy, retail, healthcare, and government markets. It also features an international footprint, with offices throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Asia-Pacific/Japan. Since the start of the year, CYBR stormed to a 35% return. Fundamentally, CyberArk symbolizes one of the best cybersecurity stocks to buy now thanks to its acumen in privileged access management (PAM). This protocol provides control and monitoring solutions for use access within an organization. Further, CyberArk ensures that sensitive credentials (for example, administrator accounts) are properly secured, monitored, and managed. Any anomalies can be dealt with immediately, mitigating digital breaches. Like other top cybersecurity stocks, CYBR comes at a hefty valuation of 122x forward earnings. Further, its longer-term revenue growth isn’t that impressive compared to its peers. However, it’s been expanding the top line robustly in recent quarters, making it worth a look. Finally, analysts believe in CYBR, pegging it a strong buy with a $189.30 target, implying 11% growth.

6,"Akamai Technologies (NASDAQ:AKAM) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 14% over the last three months. We wonder if and what role the company's financials play in that price change as a company's long-term fundamentals usually dictate market outcomes. Particularly, we will be paying attention to Akamai Technologies'  ROE today. Return on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.  See our latest analysis for Akamai Technologies  ROE can be calculated by using the formula: Return on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity So, based on the above formula, the ROE for Akamai Technologies is: 11% = US$478m ÷ US$4.3b (Based on the trailing twelve months to June 2023). The 'return' is the profit over the last twelve months. So, this means that for every $1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of $0.11. So far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or ""retain"", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics. To begin with, Akamai Technologies seems to have a respectable ROE. Be that as it may, the company's ROE is still quite lower than the industry average of 16%. Akamai Technologies was still able to see a decent net income growth of 12% over the past five years. We reckon that there could be other factors at play here. Such as - high earnings retention or an efficient management in place. However, not to forget, the company does have a decent ROE to begin with, just that it is lower than the industry average. So this also does lend some color to the fairly high earnings growth seen by the company. As a next step, we compared Akamai Technologies' net income growth with the industry and were disappointed to see that the company's growth is lower than the industry average growth of 23% in the same period. Earnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for AKAM? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.  Akamai Technologies doesn't pay any dividend, meaning that all of its profits are being reinvested in the business, which explains the fair bit of earnings growth the company has seen. In total, it does look like Akamai Technologies has some positive aspects to its business. Particularly, its earnings have grown respectably as we saw earlier, which was likely achieved due to the company reinvesting most of its earnings at a decent rate of return, to grow its business. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

7,"Akamai Technologies (AKAM) closed the latest trading day at $106.61, indicating a -0.98% change from the previous session's end. The stock trailed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.5%. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.12%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq lost 1.23%. Prior to today's trading, shares of the cloud services provider had gained 2.03% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 0.1% and the S&P 500's loss of 2.4% in that time. The investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Akamai Technologies in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is scheduled to release its earnings on November 7, 2023. It is anticipated that the company will report an EPS of $1.51, marking a 19.84% rise compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Meanwhile, the latest consensus estimate predicts the revenue to be $944.57 million, indicating a 7.11% increase compared to the same quarter of the previous year. AKAM's full-year Zacks Consensus Estimates are calling for earnings of $5.94 per share and revenue of $3.78 billion. These results would represent year-over-year changes of +10.61% and +4.57%, respectively. Any recent changes to analyst estimates for Akamai Technologies should also be noted by investors. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability. Based on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. To capitalize on this, we've crafted the Zacks Rank, a unique model that incorporates these estimate changes and offers a practical rating system. The Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been no change in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Akamai Technologies holds a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy). Investors should also note Akamai Technologies's current valuation metrics, including its Forward P/E ratio of 18.14. This represents a discount compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 24.86. Also, we should mention that AKAM has a PEG ratio of 1.87. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Internet - Services industry had an average PEG ratio of 1.9 as trading concluded yesterday. The Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This industry, currently bearing a Zacks Industry Rank of 74, finds itself in the top 30% echelons of all 250+ industries. The Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.

8,"Have you been searching for a stock that might be well-positioned to maintain its earnings-beat streak in its upcoming report? It is worth considering Akamai Technologies (AKAM), which belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry. When looking at the last two reports, this cloud services provider has recorded a strong streak of surpassing earnings estimates. The company has topped estimates by 5.87%, on average, in the last two quarters. For the most recent quarter, Akamai Technologies was expected to post earnings of $1.41 per share, but it reported $1.49 per share instead, representing a surprise of 5.67%. For the previous quarter, the consensus estimate was $1.32 per share, while it actually produced $1.40 per share, a surprise of 6.06%. For Akamai Technologies, estimates have been trending higher, thanks in part to this earnings surprise history. And when you look at the stock's positive Zacks Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction), it's a great indicator of a future earnings beat, especially when combined with its solid Zacks Rank. Our research shows that stocks with the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) or better produce a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time. In other words, if you have 10 stocks with this combination, the number of stocks that beat the consensus estimate could be as high as seven. The Zacks Earnings ESP compares the Most Accurate Estimate to the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the quarter; the Most Accurate Estimate is a version of the Zacks Consensus whose definition is related to change. The idea here is that analysts revising their estimates right before an earnings release have the latest information, which could potentially be more accurate than what they and others contributing to the consensus had predicted earlier. Akamai Technologies currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.20%, which suggests that analysts have recently become bullish on the company's earnings prospects. This positive Earnings ESP when combined with the stock's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) indicates that another beat is possibly around the corner. We expect the company's next earnings report to be released on November 7, 2023. Investors should note, however, that a negative Earnings ESP reading is not indicative of an earnings miss, but a negative value does reduce the predictive power of this metric. Many companies end up beating the consensus EPS estimate, though this is not the only reason why their shares gain.

9,"Lumen Technologies LUMN has sold a few of its content delivery network (CDN) service contracts to Akamai Technologies. Both the companies will operate under a transition services agreement for 90 days. Post that period, Lumen plans to discontinue its CDN services. Customers will be able to work with Akamai for all their CDN requirements. Akamai is a leading provider of CDN services as its platform handles approximately 2 trillion web interactions on a daily basis. Its solutions help customers to address the challenges of bandwidth constraints and Internet traffic along with reducing the need for additional hardware to manage traffic loads. LUMN continues to simplify its business operations and the sale of CDN contacts is part of that process. The company remains focused on its Quantum Fiber business as well as “cloudifying” network. Lumen had 877,000 Quantum Fiber subscribers at the end of the second quarter while Quantum Fiber penetration was 26%. Management anticipates adding subscribers at a faster rate in the second half of 2023 driven by increasing investments in quantum marketing. The company also noted that it was well-poised to nearly double its current Quantum Fiber footprint to more than 7 million locations in the next four years.

Quote It offers a wide array of integrated services like wholesale network access, high-speed Internet access, managed hosting and colocation services etc. to its business and residential customers. LUMN has undertaken a business transformation initiative whereby it has shed many non-core businesses to focus only on its robust growth opportunities. In August 2022, it sold its Latin American business to Stonepeak for $2.7 billion. It also completed the $7.5 billion divestiture of its 20-state ILEC business in October 2022. The company offloaded its EMEA business to Colt Technology Services for $1.8 billion in November 2022. Lumen is working on creating a digital enterprise and adding innovative newer functionalities to the network infrastructure to drive more value for its clientele. As part of this strategy, in June 2023, it collaborated with Google and Microsoft to introduce a network interconnection ecosystem – ExaSwitch. This platform enables organizations with high bandwidth requirements to efficiently route their traffic between networks without the need for third-party intervention. The ExaSwitch project was initiated by several key participants to facilitate traffic routing between major Internet and cloud networks. The initial adopters include Lumen, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and another major cloud provider. This ecosystem will expand as more members join, which makes it easier to automate, boost and effectively manage network capacity between its members. LUMN currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy).

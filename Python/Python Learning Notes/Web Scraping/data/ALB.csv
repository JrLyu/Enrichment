0,"The board of Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) has announced that it will pay a dividend of $0.40 per share on the 2nd of January. Including this payment, the dividend yield on the stock will be 1.2%, which is a modest boost for shareholders' returns. While the dividend yield is important for income investors, it is also important to consider any large share price moves, as this will generally outweigh any gains from distributions. Albemarle's stock price has reduced by 35% in the last 3 months, which is not ideal for investors and can explain a sharp increase in the dividend yield.  View our latest analysis for Albemarle  It would be nice for the yield to be higher, but we should also check if higher levels of dividend payment would be sustainable. However, Albemarle's earnings easily cover the dividend. As a result, a large proportion of what it earned was being reinvested back into the business. Over the next year, EPS is forecast to fall by 13.1%. If the dividend continues along recent trends, we estimate the payout ratio could be 5.8%, which we consider to be quite comfortable, with most of the company's earnings left over to grow the business in the future. The company has been paying a dividend for a long time, and it has been quite stable which gives us confidence in the future dividend potential. The annual payment during the last 10 years was $0.96 in 2013, and the most recent fiscal year payment was $1.60. This means that it has been growing its distributions at 5.2% per annum over that time. Companies like this can be very valuable over the long term, if the decent rate of growth can be maintained. The company's investors will be pleased to have been receiving dividend income for some time. Albemarle has seen EPS rising for the last five years, at 62% per annum. Rapid earnings growth and a low payout ratio suggest this company has been effectively reinvesting in its business. Should that continue, this company could have a bright future. In summary, it is good to see that the dividend is staying consistent, and we don't think there is any reason to suspect this might change over the medium term. The distributions are easily covered by earnings, and there is plenty of cash being generated as well. We should point out that the earnings are expected to fall over the next 12 months, which won't be a problem if this doesn't become a trend, but could cause some turbulence in the next year. Taking this all into consideration, this looks like it could be a good dividend opportunity. It's important to note that companies having a consistent dividend policy will generate greater investor confidence than those having an erratic one.

4,"Albemarle (ALB) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future. Shares of this specialty chemicals company have returned -14.9% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's -2.3% change. The Zacks Chemical - Diversified industry, to which Albemarle belongs, has lost 4.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term? While media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making. Earnings Estimate Revisions Here at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock. Our analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements. For the current quarter, Albemarle is expected to post earnings of $3.72 per share, indicating a change of -50.4% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -9% over the last 30 days. For the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $25.45 points to a change of +15.9% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -2.5%. For the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $18.98 indicates a change of -25.4% from what Albemarle is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -11.6%. With an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Albemarle. The chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate: 12 Month EPS Projected Revenue Growth Even though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial. For Albemarle, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $2.41 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +15.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $10.32 billion and $9.98 billion estimates indicate +41% and -3.4% changes, respectively. Last Reported Results and Surprise History Albemarle reported revenues of $2.37 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +60.2%. EPS of $7.33 for the same period compares with $3.45 a year ago. Compared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.51 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of -5.48%. The EPS surprise was +71.66%. The company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company could not beat consensus revenue estimates in any of the last four quarters. Valuation No investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance. While comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price. As part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued. Albemarle is graded A on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade. Bottom Line The facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Albemarle. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

5,"Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of the biggest analyst cuts you may have missed since yesterday: downgrades for Alphabet, Albemarle , Corning, TransUnion , Affirm Holdings , and Farfetch. InvestingPro subscribers got this news first. Never miss another market-moving headline. After Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Q3 earnings release late Tuesday, the Google operator was taking a beating and lost its Buy rating at Monness, Crespi, Hardt and a number of Wall Street analysts trimmed their price targets on the stock. GOOGL shares were recently tumbling more than 9%. The search giant beat on top and bottom lines, but cloud revenue rose less than expected - it came to $8.4 billion, a 22% climb, vs. expectations for $8.6B - and operating income was also short of expectations at $21.34B. Overall earnings came to $1.55 per share, ahead of the $1.46 average target, and total revenue of $76.7B beat the $75.9B estimate. Monness, Crespi, Hardt analysts called the operating profit result ""disappointing"" and characterized its earnings call as ""opaque."" They said they believe the company is well positioned across a number of dimensions, including AI innovations and its ""leaner cost structure,"" but that ""regulatory headwinds persist, competition is dynamic, and we believe the darkest days of this downturn are ahead of us."" Elsewhere, Citi highlighted the poor operating income result as well. Bernstein acknowledged the solid top line, but wrote, ""margin contraction and a soft cloud print weighs heavily on the question 'why buy Google here?' Bernstein trimmed the price target by $5 to $135 while keeping its Market Perform rating on the stock, and Stifel cut its own price target by $9 to $145 - although kept its Buy rating on GOOGL. GOOGL shares were recently changing hands at $126.18. Chemical maker Albemarle (NYSE:ALB), the world's largest lithium producer, was losing ground after Piper Sandler cut its rating to Neutral from Overweight and dramatically cut its price target - to $155 from the prior $255 - , as reported in real-time on InvestingPro. The downgrade is based on macro concerns: the overall long-term outlook for the industry and ""challenges in [electric vehicle] manufacturing and demand, which may conspire to significantly degrade lithium’s S/D dynamics,"" wrote the analysts. They added: ""We believe widespread downstream issues for the product owing to slowing EV demand growth driven by macroeconomic factors and product issues within the OEMs and a relatively faster rate of lithium supply growth will take the lithium market to a balanced to long situation vs. estimates of a decidedly short situation as recently as 6 months ago. As a result, lithium prices may remain under pressure and earnings growth may suffer."" Piper also downgraded lithium-focused peer Livent (NYSE:LTHM) to Neutral from Overweight in that same note, with its price target sharply reduced to $19 (from the prior $33). Albemarle shares were falling 3.6% to $134.20 soon after market open. Livent was down 2.1% to $15.57. Deutsche Bank downgraded Corning (NYSE:GLW) to Hold from Buy and cut its price target to $30.00 from $37.00. This decision followed Corning's missed Q3 earnings and a Q4 outlook that didn't match the consensus. Deutsche analysts cited significant risks to forward estimates after disappointing results from the specialty glass and ceramics purveyor, and cut the company's core EPS projections for 2024 and 2025 by 18%. The analysts also wrote that demand seems weak across Corning's key end markets, and that an upward trend might not be seen until the latter half of 2024. Deutsche’s current predictions suggest a decline in year-over-year core revenue growth through H2/24, including a 10% reduction in Q4/23 and a 6-7% decrease in H1/24. Shares were off marginally to $26.84 soon after market open. TransUnion (NYSE:TRU) was cut by two Wall Street firms on Tuesday after the company missed its Q3 earnings and provided a disappointing outlook. Following the result, the company’s shares plunged more than 23% yesterday, and were recently down another 3.5% to $48.08. BofA Securities downgraded the stock by two notches - to Underperform from Buy - and cut its price target to $44.00 from $95.00. The decision stems from the anticipated continued decline in consumer lending, expected to last until mid/late-2024. Additionally, after TransUnion's substantial 28% reduction in its Q4/23 EPS guidance, BofA says trust has been shaken in management's visibility. The combination of ongoing macroeconomic challenges and the company's relatively high leverage further dampens sentiment, wrote the analysts. Meanwhile, Evercore ISI downgraded the company, as well - to In Line from Outperform - with a price target of $82.00 (from $95.00). Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) shares were plunging some 9% to $17.79 soon after market open after Compass Point downgraded the company to Sell from Neutral with a price target of $13.00. Societe Generale downgraded Farfetch (NYSE:FTCH) to Sell from Buy with a price target of $1.50. Shares were lately trading down 7.5% o $1.72.

7,"Albemarle Corporation ALB recently completed restructuring its MARBL joint venture with Mineral Resources Limited. This restructuring, announced earlier this year, has been closed after obtaining the necessary regulatory approvals. As part of these revised agreements, the parties involved have worked to simplify their commercial arrangements. Consequently, Albemarle retains 100% ownership of the Kemerton lithium hydroxide processing facility in Australia. Furthermore, Albemarle maintains complete ownership of its Qinzhou and Meishan lithium processing facilities in China. Notable points of the updated agreements include an economic effective date (EED) of Apr 1, 2022, and joint ownership of the Wodgina mine. Under this arrangement, Albemarle and Mineral Resources hold a 50% stake in the Wodgina mine, with Mineral Resources taking on the operator role. Albemarle, which is among the prominent players in the chemical space along with Dow Inc. DOW, Eastman Chemical Company EMN and Celanese Corporation CE, is expected to make a payment to Mineral Resources in the range of $380-$400 million. This amount covers various components, including the net consideration for estimated EED settlement adjustments and the remaining 15% ownership interest in the Kemerton facility. Albemarle, in the second-quarter earnings call, raised its net sales and adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2023, anticipating net sales of $10.4-$11.5 billion due to rising lithium market prices and expecting a 40-55% year-over-year growth driven by the global shift to electric vehicles. Adjusted EBITDA is forecasted at $3.8-$4.4 billion, and adjusted earnings per share are expected to be in the range of $25.00-$29.50, reflecting a more optimistic outlook than earlier projections. Another prominent chemical maker, Dow, continues to pursue cost savings and long-term strategic goals in a challenging economic environment for the second half of 2023. The company is progressing toward $1 billion in cost savings, and its disciplined capital allocation supports its ""Decarbonize and Grow"" strategy. For the third quarter, Dow expects net sales to be around $10.25-$10.75 billion. Eastman Chemical lowered its demand growth forecast, anticipating stability in specific end markets for the latter half of 2023. It expects a decrease in adjusted EPS for the second half compared to the first half and predicts full-year 2023 EPS to be within the range of $6.50 to $7.00. The company is also targeting $1.4 billion in operating cash flow for the year. Celanese forecasts adjusted earnings of $2-$2.50 per share for the third quarter of 2023, with an estimated 30 cents impact from M&M amortization. For the full year, the company expects adjusted earnings to be in the range of $9 to $10, which incorporates roughly $1.20 per share of M&M transaction amortization.

8,"This article takes a look at the 15 best places to retire in South America. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis of how the lithium boom in South America can power retirement in the region, you may go to the 5 Best Places to Retire in South America. According to Transitions Abroad, over 200,000 American expatriates live in South America. With its pristine beaches, lush Amazon forests, and the majestic peaks of the Andes mountains, the region stands as a dream retirement destination for many. Its rich cultural heritage, combined with bustling cities and an affordable cost of living, further creates a fulfilling retirement experience for them. Retirees get to immerse themselves in a diverse array of natural wonders, explore timeless traditions, and enjoy a comfortable, yet affordable lifestyle. Owing to the growing lithium industry in the region, several South American countries have the potential to enhance their economic prospects and, in turn, become appealing destinations for expatriates. The Lithium Triangle, in particular, is one such example. It's a stripe of high-altitude land covered with lakes and white salt flats comprised of Argentina, Chile, and Bolivia, which collectively holds a significant two-thirds share of the world's lithium reserves. Considered ""white gold”, lithium is used in the manufacturing or lithium-ion batteries used in highly demanded electric vehicles (EVs), laptops, and smartphones. Together, the three Andean countries make an estimated 45,000 tons of this metal. Some of the largest lithium mining companies in the world include Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), Jiangxi Ganfeng Lithium Co. Ltd and Tianqi Lithium. Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB) and Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM) are the only two lithium companies that are operating in Chile. Argentina, the world's third-largest producer of lithium as of 2022, has three companies operating here. Two of them, Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM) and Allkem are all set to merge. While the lithium triangle does possess the precious lithium in abundance, getting it out of the ground and putting it into a shiny new EV is a complicated process in itself. This is because the extraction of lithium requires large amounts of water. Around 2.2 million liters of water are required to extract a ton of lithium. In Bolivia, 50,000 liters of water are being used every day. Meanwhile, other reports accuse mining companies in Chile of having depleted 65% of the water supplies in the Salar de Atacama region. Lithium manufacturers such as Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM) are now launching programs revolving around replanting and new irrigation systems. Nevertheless, the global transition to renewable energy and the increasing demand for electric vehicles is also opening up new avenues for investment. Individuals can participate in the growing lithium industry by investing in companies such as Albemarle Corporation (NYSE:ALB), Livent Corporation (NYSE: LTHM), Lion Town Resources, Sociedad Química y Minera de Chile S.A. (NYSE:SQM), or even through upcoming IPOs such as EnergyX. “The easiest way is to invest in these companies which have a lot of upside but there will also be specialized funds and ETFs. One such vehicle is Sprott Lithium Miners' ETF (LITP), which launched in February and counts Australian miners Pilbara, Albemarle, and IGO as its top three holdings. There are also other opportunities.” - Industry consultant Andy Leyland If South America proactively leverages its vast mineral wealth, it holds immense potential to enhance its appeal as a retirement destination for expatriates from around the world. The growing lithium industry will be able to generate revenues that can be reinvested into healthcare, infrastructure development, and other amenities, thereby improving the quality of life for retirees in the region.

9,"(Bloomberg) -- Liontown Resources Ltd. plunged by the most in more than eight years on Friday as trading resumed after US giant Albemarle Corp. walked away from a proposed takeover, forcing it to find alternative funding for its key lithium project.

The move comes just a day after the Perth-based firm said it raised additional funds through a placement with investors, pricing shares at A$1.80 apiece, which is a 35% discount to the company’s closing price before the halt last week. On Thursday, Liontown had also announced it lined up A$1.1 billion ($694 million) through an equity raising and a debt financing to fund its Kathleen Valley lithium project. Albemarle had valued the company at A$3 a share before abandoning its planned purchase on Monday. The placement was part of the package. Friday’s plunge spotlights Liontown’s recent rocky ride as it’s sought to benefit from the surge in demand for lithium, a vital material in the new-energy boom. Eager to add new supply, Albemarle had pursued its Perth-based target for months to capitalize on Kathleen Valley — one of Australia’s most promising deposits that’s due to start producing next year. Read More: Iron Ore Billionaires Are Chasing a Greener Metal: Energy Daily Over the past weeks, however, Albemarle has had to contend with the arrival of combative mining tycoon Gina Rinehart, as her Hancock Prospecting Pty. steadily built up a 19.9% stake in Liontown. Last week, she became the single largest investor, with enough clout to potentially block a shareholder vote on the deal. That led to the US company abandoning the A$6.6 billion deal, citing “growing complexities associated with executing the transaction.” “The withdrawal of the US lithium giant is a double-shot disaster for Liontown,” said Hebe Chen, an analyst at IG Markets Ltd. “The ‘no-other-way-to-go’ new shares plan not only significantly discounts its share value but also exacerbates the financial turbulence that Liontown has endured throughout this year, which is disconcerting for its investors.” Liontown had raised A$365 million through the share placement with institutional investors, and a further A$10.8 million from Chairman Timothy Goyder. Liontown also signed commitment letters for a debt package of A$760 million from banks and government credit agencies, it said Thursday. The company plans to raise up to a further A$45 million from existing shareholders. Cost Pressures Proceeds from the debt and equity raising will be used to refinance existing debt and completing costs for the Kathleen Valley project in Western Australia, which has been pressured by higher input prices. In September, Liontown announced the project would cost A$951 million to enter production. “We have ensured an appropriate financial buffer is in place to allow the company to successfully weather any unforeseen issues that may arise,” Chief Executive Officer Tony Ottaviano said in Thursday’s statement, adding that the financings are critical in de-risking the development of the project. Rinehart’s next steps are unknown. Her privately held Hancock Prospecting said last week that it sought a “prominent influence in Liontown’s future.” Liontown’s share plunge on Friday — which was its biggest since March 2015 — was no surprise, according to Citigroup Inc. analysts led by Kate McCutcheon. “While the price of A$1.80 per share is a 40% discount to Albemarle’s withdrawn bid and likely to disappoint Liontown holders, it’s in line with the trading range of producers here given spodumene pricing is down about 30% over the quarter,” the analysts wrote in a note, in which they upgraded the stock from sell to neutral. “Kathleen Valley, in time, will likely be a meaningful producer,” while the company’s balance sheet overhang was now removed, they added. --With assistance from Annie Lee.

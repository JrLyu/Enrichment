0,"In the past week, sector heavyweights like Alaska Air Group ALK and Southwest Airlines LUV reported third-quarter 2023 earnings. While air travel demand remained upbeat, high costs hurt results. Meanwhile, Hawaiian Holdings’ HA loss widened in third-quarter 2023, owing to below-par revenues. Spirit Airlines’ SAVE revenues declined year over year due to the slowdown in domestic travel. .More earnings-related updates are available in the previous week’s write-up. 1.

1,"Institutions' substantial holdings in Alaska Air Group implies that they have significant influence over the company's share price A total of 15 investors have a majority stake in the company with 51% ownership Ownership research along with  analyst forecasts data  help provide a good understanding of opportunities in a stock If you want to know who really controls Alaska Air Group, Inc. (NYSE:ALK), then you'll have to look at the makeup of its share registry. With 82% stake, institutions possess the maximum shares in the company. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company. Given the vast amount of money and research capacities at their disposal, institutional ownership tends to carry a lot of weight, especially with individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future. Let's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Alaska Air Group.  See our latest analysis for Alaska Air Group  Institutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index. As you can see, institutional investors have a fair amount of stake in Alaska Air Group. This implies the analysts working for those institutions have looked at the stock and they like it. But just like anyone else, they could be wrong. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Alaska Air Group's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. Institutional investors own over 50% of the company, so together than can probably strongly influence board decisions. Alaska Air Group is not owned by hedge funds. Looking at our data, we can see that the largest shareholder is The Vanguard Group, Inc. with 11% of shares outstanding. The second and third largest shareholders are Victory Capital Management Inc. and BlackRock, Inc., with an equal amount of shares to their name at 6.3%. Looking at the shareholder registry, we can see that 51% of the ownership is controlled by the top 15 shareholders, meaning that no single shareholder has a majority interest in the ownership. While studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. There are plenty of analysts covering the stock, so it might be worth seeing what they are forecasting, too. The definition of an insider can differ slightly between different countries, but members of the board of directors always count. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves. I generally consider insider ownership to be a good thing. However, on some occasions it makes it more difficult for other shareholders to hold the board accountable for decisions. Our data suggests that insiders own under 1% of Alaska Air Group, Inc. in their own names. It's a big company, so even a small proportional interest can create alignment between the board and shareholders. In this case insiders own US$15m worth of shares. It is good to see board members owning shares, but it might be worth checking if those insiders have been buying.  The general public-- including retail investors -- own 18% stake in the company, and hence can't easily be ignored. While this size of ownership may not be enough to sway a policy decision in their favour, they can still make a collective impact on company policies. While it is well worth considering the different groups that own a company, there are other factors that are even more important. Be aware that  Alaska Air Group is showing  1 warning sign in our investment analysis , you should know about... But ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.

2,"It’s been less than two weeks since Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL kick started the third-quarter earnings season for the airline space. Overall, the season has been mixed for the industry. The sector still has to traverse a long way before it can reach the pre-pandemic level. However, the pureplay airlines ETF U.S. Global Jets ETF JETS has lost 11.5% past month (as of Oct 24, 2022). In fact, the fund underperformed the S&P 500 (down 2.1%) in the past one-month period. This makes third-quarter airlines earnings more important this season as it could determine what lies ahead of the sector. Let’s delve a little deeper. Delta Air Lines Inc. DAL reported third-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding 31 cents from non-recurring items) of $2.03 per share, which comfortably beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.92 and improved 35% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $15,488 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $15,290.4 million and increased 11% on a year-over-year basis, driven by higher air travel demand. United Airlines’ UAL reported third-quarter 2023 earnings per share (excluding 23 cents from non-recurring items) of $3.65, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $3.40 and improved 29.9% year over year. Operating revenues of $14,484 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $14,441.8 million. The top line increased 12.5% year over year due to upbeat air-travel demand. American Airlines’ AAL third-quarter 2023 earnings (excluding $1.21 from non-recurring items) of 38 cents per share easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 26 cents. Results were aided by higher revenues driven by the buoyant air-travel-demand scenario. In the year-ago quarter, AAL reported earnings of 69 cents. Operating revenues of $13,482 million increased marginally year over year. The top line missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $13,518.7 million. Low-cost carrier Southwest Airlines Co. LUV reported second-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $1.09, which outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.08 but declined 16.2% on a year-over-year basis. Revenues of $7,037 million beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $6,988.7 million and improved 4.6% year over year on solid leisure demand. Alaska Air Group ALK reported lower-than-expected earnings per share and revenues in third-quarter 2023. The underperformance was mainly due to high fuel as well as labor costs. Expenses on wages and benefits rose 14% year over year to $782 million in the reported quarter. The labor deal inked by management with pilots last year has led to increased labor costs. High fuel costs due to an escalation in oil price were also a bane and hurt third-quarter results. The $1.32-billion-fund holds about 50 stocks in its portfolio and is concentrated on a few individual securities. All the above-mentioned stocks get a place in the portfolio. The product charges 60 bps in fees. While the investing backdrop for JETS is still moderately gloomy, some companies beat on estimates. High oil prices are concerns. However, increased travel demand in the holiday season could bode well for the concerned stocks and the fund.   Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

4,"In a terrifying incident that unfolded yesterday, an Alaska Airlines flight, operated by Horizon Airlines, had to be diverted from its course when an off-duty pilot attempted to disable the aircraft’s engines. The incident, which ended without harm to the passengers and crew, has rekindled a heated debate on airline security measures and the screening process for airline staff. Shortly after departing from Everett, WA, on its way to San Francisco, the flight had to be diverted to Portland, OR., following what Alaska Airlines described as “a credible security threat.” The off-duty pilot, identified as Joseph David Emerson, was traveling in the flight deck jump seat and made an unsuccessful attempt to “disrupt the operation of the engines,” according to an official statement from Alaska Airlines. Emerson has since been charged with 83 counts of attempted murder, among other serious charges. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) confirmed that it is supporting ongoing law enforcement investigations into the shocking episode. However, as investigations continue, questions regarding security measures and staff screening procedures are being raised. Former airline pilot Ryan Tseko, in comments made to Benzinga, pointed out a potential vulnerability in current protocols. Unlike the average traveler, airline pilots and other staff members enrolled in the Known Crewmember (KCM) program have access to their own security line. Tseko highlighted, ""As a pilot, you’re commanding the ship. You're a trusted person. They let you walk through security with minimal screening."" While the KCM program is designed to streamline processes for verified airline employees, it might be a double-edged sword. Pilots and flight attendants show their badge and ID, but in many instances, their luggage goes unchecked. Tseko emphasized a recent trend that could exacerbate the issue, saying, ""As everyone knows, the airlines have been dealing with a serious pilot shortage. As a result, they're hiring pilots with fewer flight hours and they're being less stringent with their screening process."" With the daunting responsibility of managing a plane and hundreds of lives, it’s essential to ensure that pilots are both professionally and mentally equipped for the role. Tseko added, ""Being a pilot is stressful. If people aren't mentally fit, they will break."" This raises concerns about the regularity and thoroughness of mental health evaluations and screenings for airline pilots. Tseko, during an interview with Fox News, further articulated the potential internal threats, noting, “We’ve seen in the past the majority of threats actually in the airlines and in the airport are actually internal."" He suggested the recent incident could affect pilots’ ability to utilize the jump seat, a critical utility for many, as they often depend on it for commuting. The key question remains: Are airlines doing enough to guarantee the mental fitness of their pilots? “The airlines need to be asking themselves, what are we doing to make sure the pilots we're hiring are mentally capable of handling the job?"" remarked Tseko. As the dust settles from this alarming incident, it serves as a potent reminder of the importance of continually refining and improving security measures, both for passengers and airline staff alike. The incident is not just a call to re-evaluate security checkpoints but a broader push to ensure comprehensive mental health support and thorough vetting processes for those entrusted with our safety in the skies. Ryan Tseko boasts an impressive background in the aviation industry. With over 20 years of experience as a commercial pilot, Tseko began his career with United Airlines' United Express. He then climbed the ranks, eventually securing the position of lead captain at Jet Aviation, where he piloted the renowned Gulfstream G550. Tseko has since transitioned into the world of real estate and is currently the executive vice president at Cardone Capital, overseeing the management of a staggering $4.3 billion real estate portfolio.

5,"The attempt by an off-duty pilot to shut down the engines of a U.S. airliner in midflight highlights the threat that insiders pose to aviation safety with their ability to go where passengers are prohibited. Events like the one Sunday on a Horizon Air jetliner are very rare, but they are potentially devastating. The captain and co-pilot prevented disaster by subduing the off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who — from his perfect vantage point in the cockpit jump seat — tried to cut fuel to the engines. “We’re just lucky he wasn’t flying the plane when he decided to do this. What’s going to stop that?” said Jon Loffi, a longtime law enforcement officer who teaches aviation security at Oklahoma State University and wrote a paper on identifying insider threats. There is something of a see-something, say-something mindset in aviation, where employees are encouraged to voluntarily report anything that raises a safety concern, including suspicious behavior of colleagues. It's not clear how often that happens, however — if ever. The pilot who was arrested after Sunday's flight doesn't appear to have raised alarms. Neighbors and fellow members of a flying club where he was an instructor described him as a great guy who was obsessed with safety. Pilots are required to undergo psychological screening as part of their regularly scheduled medical exams. The pilot involved in Sunday's incident got his most recent exam in September, according to FAA records. During those exams, pilots are supposed to go through an interview and report whether they have received psychiatric treatment and what medicines they take. The Federal Aviation Administration says its approved medical examiners are trained to gauge a pilot's mental health. Airlines frequently conduct their own interviews that include a psychological evaluation, “but most of those are to determine whether the pilot is a good fit for the company, not whether they are mentally unstable,” said Jeffrey Price, an aviation-security expert at Metropolitan State University of Denver. The Horizon close call could result in the re-examination of the practice of letting off-duty pilots or other airline employees sit in the cockpit jump seat. “I’m afraid this will put that privilege in jeopardy now,” said Ross Aimer, a retired airline pilot who is now CEO of an aviation-consulting firm. “This is obviously an extremely important issue, and they have to quickly come up with an answer.” Price said airlines must approve people who sit in the jump seat, but the captain can deny access. “Our flight crew vetting system is just that — it’s based on trust,” he said. “We have to trust personnel to a certain extent, or the system doesn’t work.” Loffi, the Oklahoma State professor, said banning pilots from the jump seat would be silly because a pilot intent on crashing the plane could simply wait until their turn to operate a flight. Investigators concluded that is what happened on board a Germanwings plane in 2015. They determined that the co-pilot deliberately crashed the plane in the French Alps. The man had been treated for suicidal tendences but did not tell the airline. A FedEx pilot riding on a cargo plane tried to kill the crew and crash the plane in 1994 but was stopped by the on-duty pilots. In 1987, a fired employee who still had his security badge hijacked a Pacific Southwest Airlines jet, which crashed in California, killing everyone on board. On rare occasions, other employees including a mechanic have been accused of sabotaging planes. Loffi said pilots could be subjected to more rigorous psychological examinations, as is often done with police officers, but that’s not foolproof either. “I think we're doing a pretty good job of managing the insider threat,"" he said. ""How often does this happen? Darn seldom. And it's just so hard to predict this kind of behavior.” Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said the FAA will look into “any safety considerations"" that come out of investigations of the Horizon Air incident. Security experts say it would be difficult if not impossible to stop every determined criminal or terrorist who targets aviation. They say there are steps that could make such an attack more difficult, but they would come at a cost of time and money. One possibility is to make airline and airport employees go through the same type of security checkpoints as passengers. Currently many of those insiders can go behind security perimeters with the right credentials. Federal law requires that people seeking to work in secure areas of an airport must pass a criminal-records check and a ""security threat assessment” that includes checking their names against a terrorism watch list. The vetting is conducted by the Transportation Security Administration. The off-duty Alaska Airlines pilot who was arrested after the Horizon flight, Joseph David Emerson, joined Horizon as a first officer or co-pilot in 2001. In 2012, he went to work at Virgin America, which was bought by Alaska in 2016. Emerson was promoted to captain in 2019. Alaska Airlines said Emerson met all requirements for medical exams “and at no point were his certifications denied, suspended or revoked.” On Tuesday, Emerson was being held in the Multnomah County, Oregon, jail on one federal count of interfering with a flight crew and 83 state counts of attempted murder, a felony, 83 counts of misdemeanor reckless endangerment, and one count of endangering an aircraft, a felony. He was due to be arraigned Tuesday in Portland. Emerson's neighbors in Pleasant Hill, California, a suburb about 30 miles east of San Francisco, describe him as friendly, and officials of a local flying club say he is meticulous about safety. “No sign he was off. Nothing,” Karen Yee, a neighbor whose grandchildren play with Emerson's two elementary-school kids, told The (San Jose) Mercury News. “He is everything you would want to have in a good neighbor. We see him over the fence and on walks. Great guy. Great family.” Allen Scott, former president of a flying club where Emerson served as a flight instructor several years ago, told the San Francisco Chronicle he has flown with Emerson and he was “fanatical” about safety. ___ Claire Rush in Portland, Oregon, contributed to this report."
6,"Oct 24 (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Tuesday charged an off-duty pilot accused of trying to shut off the engines of an Alaska Airlines flight on Sunday over the Pacific Northwest. Joseph David Emerson, 44, of Pleasant Hill, California, an Alaska Airlines pilot, was charged in a criminal complaint with one count of interfering with flight crew members and attendants. Prosecutors said after the cockpit incident that Emerson, in wrist restraints, tried to grab the handle of an emergency exit during the flight's descent but was stopped by a flight attendant.

7,"PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) — An off-duty commercial pilot riding in an extra cockpit seat on a Horizon Air flight said “I’m not OK” just before trying to cut the engines midflight and later told police he had recently taken psychedelic mushrooms as his mental health worsened, according to a federal complaint made public Tuesday. It was not immediately clear from the court document if 44-year-old Joseph David Emerson was high on mushrooms when he was on the plane; in a written statement, Alaska Airlines, which owns Horizon, said neither the gate agents nor flight crew noticed any signs of impairment that might have barred him from the flight. But an FBI agent wrote in a probable cause affidavit that the pilot spoke with police after his arrest about the use of psychedelic mushrooms and “said it was his first-time taking mushrooms.” Kevin Sonoff, the spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Oregon, said it was still under investigation whether Emerson took psychedelic mushrooms and when. Emerson, an Alaska Airlines pilot from Pleasant Hill, California, was initially arrested in Oregon on Sunday night on state counts of attempted murder after the flight crew reported that he attempted to shut down the engines on a Horizon Air flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco while riding in the extra seat in the cockpit. The plane was diverted to Portland, where it landed safely with more than 80 people onboard. A federal charge of interfering with a flight crew made public Tuesday said Emerson, who as an off-duty pilot was authorized to ride in the cockpit’s jump seat, made casual conversation with the captain and first officer when the plane was between Astoria, Oregon, and Portland, before trying to grab two red handles that would have activated the plane’s fire suppression system and cut off fuel to its engines. After what the flight crew described as a brief struggle, lasting only about 30 seconds, Emerson left the cockpit, the FBI said. Flight attendants placed Emerson in wrist restraints and seated him in the rear of the aircraft, but as the plane descended, he tried to grab the handle of an emergency exit, according to the document. A flight attendant stopped him by placing her hands on top of his, it said. The Associated Press has been unable to contact Emerson’s family or others who might speak on his behalf. Court records did not indicate if he has obtained a lawyer. Alaska Airlines said Tuesday that Emerson had been relieved of all duties. The captain and first officer told police after the plane landed that Emerson said, “I'm not OK” just before he reached up to pull the handles. They were able to stop him before he pulled the handles all the way down, the affidavit said. Emerson walked calmly to the back of the plane after being told to leave the cockpit and told a flight attendant, “You need to cuff me right now or it’s going to be bad,” the affidavit said. Another flight attendant heard him saying, “I messed everything up” and ""tried to kill everybody.” According to the affidavit, he asked police if he could waive his right to an attorney: “I’m admitting to what I did. I’m not fighting any charges you want to bring against me, guys.” He also told them he thought he was having a nervous breakdown and said: ""I pulled both emergency shut off handles because I thought I was dreaming and I just wanna wake up,” according to the affidavit. Pilots are required to undergo psychological screening as part of their regularly scheduled medical exams. There have been crashes that investigators believe were deliberately caused by pilots. Authorities said the co-pilot of a Germanwings jet that crashed in the French Alps in 2015 had practiced putting the plane into a dive. Emerson took his most recent exam in September, FAA records show — but according to the FBI's affidavit, Emerson told police he became depressed about six months ago. Oregon this year became the first U.S. state to legalize the use of psychedelic mushrooms by adults. While psilocybin remains illegal in most of the country, the Food and Drug Administration in 2018 designated it a “breakthrough therapy” that might be used for mental health conditions or substance use disorders. Some researchers believe psilocybin changes the way the brain organizes itself, helping a user adopt new attitudes and overcome mental health issues. Emerson was to remain in state custody pending an initial appearance in U.S. District Court in Portland, the U.S. attorney's office said in a news release. He was also scheduled to be arraigned in state court on Tuesday afternoon. The federal charge of interfering with a flight crew carries up to 20 years in prison. Mark Angelos, a senior flight instructor at the NRI Flying Club in Concord, California, has known Emerson for more than 10 years. Emerson used to be president of the club and designed its safety program, meaning he was in charge of making sure instructors followed standard operating procedures, Angelos said. Angelos said that when he and other club members initially heard the news, they thought Horizon Air must’ve been conducting some sort of emergency drill. They couldn’t believe that a person they saw as a family man who loved his children could be accused of such a thing. “We thought the airline was conducting a test of its crew, to be honest,” he said. “We know now it was not.” Lost for words, he expressed his shock. “It just couldn’t have been our Joe.” ___ Johnson reported from Seattle."
8,"(Adds details from charging documents; suspect pleads not guilty to state charges) By David Shepardson and Steve Gorman Oct 24 (Reuters) - An off-duty pilot charged with trying to disable the engines of an Alaska Airlines jet in flight told police afterward he was suffering a nervous breakdown, had taken psychedelic mushrooms two days earlier and had not slept in 40 hours, court documents showed on Tuesday. Joseph David Emerson, 44, an Alaska Airlines pilot, was riding as a standby employee passenger in the cockpit ""jump seat"" of Sunday's flight, en route from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco, when the airborne altercation occurred, authorities said. After a brief scuffle inside the flight deck with the captain and first officer, Emerson ended up being restrained by members of the cabin crew and was arrested in Portland, Oregon, where the flight was diverted and landed safely. He was charged in Oregon state court on Tuesday with 83 counts of attempted murder - one for every crew member and passenger on the plane besides himself - and a single count of endangering an aircraft. He pleaded not guilty to those charges through his attorney at a brief arraignment hearing on Tuesday in Multnomah County Circuit Court in Portland. Emerson was charged in a separate federal criminal complaint with one count of interfering with flight crew members and attendants. The charging documents in both cases were filed with sworn affidavits from investigators outlining a harrowing sequence of events that came close to shutting down hydraulic operation and fuel to both engines of the twin-jet aircraft, an Embraer 175. MENTAL CRISIS SUGGESTED According to the affidavits, Emerson told police after his arrest that he was suffering a mental crisis during the incident and had struggled with depression for the past six months. The court documents said he also told police that he had taken ""magic mushrooms"" for the first time, ingesting them about 48 hours before boarding the plane. Alaska Air Group, the airline's parent company, said in a statement on Tuesday that at no time during the check-in or boarding process did employees observe any signs of impairment that would have led them to prevent Emerson from flying. Alaska Airlines Flight 2059 was operated by the group's regional subsidiary Horizon Air, the company said. Court documents gave no indication of whether investigators had confirmed any drug or alcohol use by the suspect, though one of the arresting officers told investigators that Emerson did not appear ""outwardly under the influence of intoxicants."" Medical research has shown that psilocybin, a naturally occurring hallucinogen found in certain mushroom varieties known as ""magic mushrooms,"" to be beneficial as a treatment for anxiety, depression and other mental disorders. A ballot measure approved by voters in 2020 made Oregon the first U.S. state to decriminalize psilocybin and to legalize its supervised therapeutic use for adults at least 21 years old. But psilocybin remains strictly prohibited under federal law. COCKPIT AND CABIN STRUGGLES The two pilots who were at the controls of Flight 2059 told investigators, according to affidavits, that Emerson had started out chatting with them casually, before suddenly hurling his radio headset across the cockpit and saying, ""I'm not OK."" At that point, he reached up and grabbed two red-colored fire-suppression handles, pulling them downward, an affidavit said. A scuffle ensued as one of the two pilots quickly clutched Emerson's wrist to keep him from fully engaging the handles, while the other declared an in-flight emergency, before Emerson abruptly quieted down again and left the cockpit. The flight crew later told investigators that had Emerson managed to fully deploy the shut-off handles, the plane was ""seconds away"" from being turned into a glider. In his interview with police, the affidavits said, Emerson acknowledged pulling the handles, saying he did so because he felt like he was trying to awaken from a dream. After leaving the cockpit, he was escorted to the back of the plane, placed in a flight attendant's seat and was fitted with handcuffs, having warned the cabin crew: ""You need to cuff me right now or it’s going to be bad,"" according to affidavits. Even as he was under restraint, the court documents said, Emerson tried to grab an emergency exit handle, but a flight attendant stopped him by placing her hands over his and making conversation to distract him. Another flight attendant cited in the affidavits was quoted as telling authorities she overheard Emerson say: ""I messed everything up,"" and that he had stated that he had ""tried to kill everybody."" Emerson joined Alaska Air Group as a Horizon first officer in August 2001 and later a pilot, Alaska Airlines said, adding that ""at no point were his certifications denied, suspended or revoked."" Aviators are expected to self-report any mental health conditions, the company said.

9,"Oct 24 (Reuters) - An off-duty pilot accused of trying to shut off the engines of an Alaska Airlines jet on a weekend flight over the Pacific Northwest was due to make his first court appearance on Tuesday in Portland, Oregon, where he faced 83 counts of attempted murder. Joseph David Emerson, 44, was arrested on Sunday in Portland, where the twin-engine aircraft landed safely after it was diverted during what the airline called a ""credible security threat"" on a flight from Everett, Washington, to San Francisco. Emerson was off-duty at the time and riding as a validated ""jump seat"" passenger in the cockpit of the plane - a routine mode of transport for commercial airline pilots hitching flights back home or to their next assignment, according to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). He was booked into jail on 83 counts of attempted murder, 83 counts of recklessly endangering another person and one count of endangering an aircraft, according to a spokesperson for the local prosecutor in Portland. Formal charges were expected to be filed on Tuesday in Multnomah County court in Portland, where the suspect was due to appear for an afternoon arraignment and enter a plea, the spokesperson added. Alaska Airlines Flight 2059 was operated by Alaska Air Group's regional subsidiary Horizon Air, the carrier said. The FAA told U.S. airlines in a notice seen by Reuters that the off-duty pilot had sought to disable the engines of the Embraer 175 by attempting to activate the engines' fire-suppression system while the plane was at cruise altitude. ""The crew was able to subdue the suspect and was removed from the flight deck,"" the FAA notice said. The engines were never disabled, Alaska said. An FAA pilot database showed Emerson listed as a certified pilot who received a medical clearance last month. Aviators are expected to self-report any mental health conditions, two U.S. pilots told Reuters. The Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA), the world's largest pilots union, which represents aviators at Alaska, said in a statement that the airline ""profession in North America is one of the most highly vetted and scrutinized careers."" Adam Silverthorne, president of California-based NRI Flying Club, said the incident was incongruous with the kindhearted, methodical family man he knew Emerson to be several years ago when Emerson was a club member and provided flight instruction. A club newsletter mentioned Emerson was at NRI in 2016. The FBI in Portland said there was ""no continuing threat related to this incident"" to the traveling public. The FAA told airlines in a separate notice on Monday the incident ""is not connected in any way, shape or form to current world events"" but said it is ""always good practice to maintain vigilance.""

5,"I feel this, I was a sophomore in high school when the 07-08‚Äô crash. My mom lost her job and I watched her go through her life savings to support our house. I was always wondering when our family was going to get help and the help never came. To add insult to injury I saw ws get billion dollar bail outs and spin the story on poor people. This is the first time in my 30years of life I‚Äôve ever seen ws feel the same pain and worry my mother felt. IM ALL IN TOMORROW. This is personal. The same children they robbed 13 years ago grew up and we have money now ourselves

EDIT: IM NOT FUCKING SELLING"
6,"I'm with you so much. 

I'm so fucking tired of these fuckers winning. I'm so tired of no consequences, of rules that are only for the 99% and never for the 1%. 

I watched my dad stress over his 401k during the .com bust of the late 90s (but he was an OG diamond hands and held strong!). Then lived through the hell of 9/11 and watched as our government utilized that to trample upon our civil liberties (Patriot Act, anyone?) for the next two decades. After that, I graduated college during the Great Recession of '08 and while I was pretty fortunate to grab a job in tech, I watched so many of my friends flounder for *years* trying to start a career in less resilient industries while these fuckwits like Melvin profitted off all of it. Now as I'm trying to start a family with my spouse, I have to deal with a global pandemic, no doubt exacerbated by DJT and his servitude to the 1%. I'm locked up in my fucking house, isolated from my own family for a year plus now, just lost my uncle to a very abrupt and unexpected COVID death, and seeing so many out there struggling financially, mentally, emotionally... and I am just FUCKING SICK OF ALL OF IT. And I realize that despite all that, I am still way more privileged than so very many. 

I'm angry for me but I'm MORE ANGRY for those who are even more powerless against the powers that be than I am. And I'm fighting for them too. I have to. We have to. WE are the ones with some fucking shred of morality left.

I am holding my position in GME. It's about principle. It's about the 99% starting to realize that we have a *fighting chance* to not spend the rest of our lives being completely and utterly steamrolled by these greedy boomer pricks, if we see ourselves as a collective and not as individuals.

I, for one, am not going to spend the rest of my life hearing about avocado toast and Starbucks purchases being the downfall of millennial/Gen Z's financial futures... while these ass clown Boomers have wrecked basically fucking everything from the environment to the financial world to actual human rights and dignity... all to make a goddamn buck. And had the audacity to tsk tsk at *us* all along, as if we EVER had the power or the control that they did.

GME $1000 let's fucking go. We like the stock. We like to say FUCK YOU."
7,"I was little when the recession hit, but I remember bits and pieces. I remember my grandparents losing their car dealerships, my dad losing his job at said dealerships, my Mom returning to work as a teacher. I didn't know the extent to how bad things were until recent years. I remember one day in freshman year of high school, I was having a mental and emotional breakdown. My dad leveled with me in a way he never had before. He admitted to me that when we lost the dealerships, he went on unemployment, and things were getting pretty bad. He admitted to me (something I don't even think he told my mother) that he was extremely close to just getting into a ""car accident"" and supporting us with his life insurance.

I've had the fortune of not actually seeing him in that state, and I intend to keep it that way. I'm not a tankie or anything, I fully believe in and support capitalism, but I genuinely hope these mushroom dick bankers and pig fuckers on Wall Street choke on my testicles. I don't like to believe that people in this world are cartoonishly evil, but I know these knob-slobbering chodes have absolutely no problem demolishing the lives of millions just so they can get another yacht.

And I really hope this is it, I really hope this is the beginning of a takedown of these predatory miscreants. I pray that this isn't just some blip in history where a bunch of assholes on the internet made a mess of things. This will be a revolution in which the masses reap their rewards. Not from violence and riots, not from meaningless protests that make school kids think they're revolutionaries, not from the government making taxes and legislation, but from *SHEER. UNADULTERATED. AUTISM.* WE'LL TAKE BACK WHATS OURS BY TAKING THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE FREE MARKET, MAKING IT INTO A FIST, AND SHOVING UP THEIR ASS! SORRY MR.

A lot of things were cut off, piano lessons, birthdays etc. My mom told me that till this day my dad isn‚Äôt himself. He‚Äôs still unemployed but day trading, but doesn‚Äôt earn as much as her. He feels depressed since he feels that he should be the breadwinner. Now, he‚Äôs taken care of me and my sister, so I gotta make sure him and my mom are taken care of. Fuck you Melvin.

Don‚Äôt you think all this retail investing and volume will go away once we all are really shown behind the curtain just how rigged the game is. 

CNBC proved yesterday and today that we have a rigged stock market. They did this though not by telling us; but by showing us in the way in which they behaved live on air; Andrew Ross Sorkin‚Äôs vagina aching; speaking down, or talking down, to us like we are all peasants. 

Fuck that. 

Fuck them.

If they think they can just move goal post & cheat and get away with it like a rigged election, not this time. Not with my $GME calls. 

Now when for once in American History, David has proven he can defeat Goliath.

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!!

Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

42,"Hey I just wanna say, I used to be on 4chan when I was in middle school and it did a lot of bad things for my development. I saw things a child was not supposed to see. It was ultimately bad for me. But the one thing I gained from that place was this sense of giddiness and community with people I have never and will never meet. It was a weird special feeling I would get every once in a while.

I was a casual reddit user and it was all fine, but WSB and this GME shit has filled me with a specific sense of euphoria I havent felt in a very long time. Seeing millions of fucking idiots banding together (LEGALLY AND NOT COLLUDING) with their scraps of income to ultimately cause one of the biggest and unprecedented shifts in the market I have ever seen fills me with such a deep sense of community and joy.

The squeeze probably will NOT happen today. All we will see is options expiring. This will drive the price up. DON'T BE FOOLED THOUGH. This won't be the real squeeze yet! That will probably happen next week.

THEY WILL RELEASE A PRESS STATEMENT AT 9AM, IT WILL ALL BE LIES, DONT BE FOOLED BY IT. DONT LISTEN TO THE MEDIA. HOLD YOUR FUCKING GROUND.

On top of this there will be HUGE SHORT LADDER attacks all throughout the day. DONT BE FOOLED, there is no fucking volume and like yesterday, nobody will be selling!

We will take them for EVERYTHING they have and more. Their bunruptcy is cover by insurance firms, who are also covered until infinity. We will get our money one way or the other!

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

65,"I hear a lot of people claiming that what's happening here with GME is some sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.

On Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the ""BUY"" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.

What happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!

Because these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.

They know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.
WE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.

On Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's ""too risky"", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.

They know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.

THAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand. We could see the stock rise to $1,000 a share, only too plummet to $5 in a matter of minutes, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA SELL SHIT!!!

We're living in a timeline where the most retarded community on the entire internet has a chance to be the ones that take down the biggest assholes living on this earth, and literally change the financial world forever. ALL YOU MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SHARES!!!

Fuck the moon, we got the gas the get to Andromeda. Are you willing to come along for the ride and make history? DON'T SELL!"

The squeeze probably will NOT happen today. All we will see is options expiring. This will drive the price up. DON'T BE FOOLED THOUGH. This won't be the real squeeze yet! That will probably happen next week.

On top of this there will be HUGE SHORT LADDER attacks all throughout the day. DONT BE FOOLED, there is no fucking volume and like yesterday, nobody will be selling!

We will take them for EVERYTHING they have and more. Their bunruptcy is cover by insurance firms, who are also covered until infinity. We will get our money one way or the other!

73,"Are we really doing this that any WSBer disagreeing is branded a shill?

OK.   Better get that fucking seppoku prevention hotline stickied to the daily thread.  For some of us, this is not our first time going through the hype cycle.

There are 10,000+ Hedge Funds. Russia are the world's biggest miner of Silver.

Anyone thinking they are still in a fight with Melvin Capital is fooling themselves.

We might still squeeze GME but without being able to lock up the float (thanks brokers and clearing house!) it is looking far less likely.

You can accuse me of shilling all you want, IDGAF but we have reached the point where the emojis need to turn into exit plans.

There are still motherfuckers in this sub thinking 69 thousand a share is possible even as it plummets 50% in a day.  This is not VW.  There is no corporate takeover.  It all feels like fun and games when 20,000 are cheering you to HOL.  Will they fucking Hold your depression when it sinks in you shat a quarter mill down the drain cause the mob made you?

Prevention hotline will be stickied soon, ask the old timers. They know it.

You don't have to sell but you do need to stop deluding yourself you have short sellers by the balls.  Melvin are fucking buried.  The volumes last week were 700m.  It was 17m alone after hours on Thurs.

Now there are 9,999 other Funds looking at retail holders and trying to figure out how to separate you from any gains you have made.

I have been through 2 iterations of this sub.  2013 and 2020 Pandemic.

This level of group think is unprecedented and I have no doubt Reddit will shut us down when the reports of total financial ruin come in and make media headlines.

We have so many invested in GME.  Literally can't go tits up.  I mean, they downvoted every naysayer, how could it fail? Amirite?

Edit:  *Here is how we know this is going tits up* 

- The sub is not considering that Melvin were destroyed by other Funds.  Less than 1% are actively looking at institutions and thinking ""how will they attack my gains""?
- The distractions are not being attributed to anything other than Citadel.  Not state sponsored. Not other funds.  It all one homogenous enemy in the subs eyes
- We have progressed to the QAnon part of our agenda. Yep, the shares are counterfeit and (insert deity) will reveal it ALL at (insert date).  Keep holding! It will be blown open! 
- The sub used to be intelligent people pretending to be dumb..and it declined bit by bit but now it is a festering cesspool of monkeys throwing shit and piss at each other and upvoting magic chants and spells.
- Most importantly, the monkeys **refuse** to believe the shorts have covered even though volumes last week were 700m.   We lost, the clearing houses and brokers fucked us.  The melt up to $450+ was the squeeze."
74,"I'm going to start repeating this as many times as possible:

FOR THESE HEDGE FUNDS, LEGALITY IS IRRELEVANT. ALL THAT MATTERS IS PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL. CAPITAL BUYS POLITICIANS, REGULATORS (YELLEN lol), AND LAWYERS TO DELAY AND DIMINISH ANY POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES.

Also, there is so many financial products OTC that can be structured and combined to control outcomes. Especially when the market distorts like this, yes there is a few in the cross hairs, but the rest just see opportunity. The bulk of the pain was done, and the Hedge Funds were wounded, maybe some mortally. But ultimately over the next month this board is going to be littered with individuals who have ruined their lives. To invest in a hedge fund you have to be an accredited investor- having at least 250k of liquid assets, usually in 25k increments. Whoever had capital at Melvin has a lot of capital and it‚Äôs just one position in a portfolio and not the end of the world. On the other hand there will be people that lose their retirements here, their savings, relationships, houses, and god forbid somebody fucking kills themselves. The board has gone from inspiring to delusional in a week flat, it‚Äôs fucking sad to see people careening off a cliff and not knowing it."

But yeah, literally all of this was called in advance and then it literally happened, so I'm not too worried about it. 6,000,000+ new people in this sub that weren't here when it started to pick up and weren't able to soak up all the information prior to the mainstream explosion, therefore are less educated on the situation and are more prone to folding."
80,"This is not 100% true. I was once employed by an oilfield company. When the CEO/Owner sold he gave ALL of us a gigantic severance package based on tenure. The secretary alone (35+years) got 6 figures.

81,"I work at 30ish person start up, and I think it‚Äôs reasonable for me to feel bad about screwing over my coworkers.

At one point he said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm your manager, which means I‚Äôm supposed to be helping you all out, not the other way around.‚Äù 

I‚Äôm sure that there are many people who do feel unnecessarily guilty about leaving companies that wouldn‚Äôt think twice about laying them off if it helped their profits, but I think it‚Äôs unfair to paint ALL companies and managers as being totally heartless. I would guess that bigger/publicly traded companies are more likely to behave like that, but for smaller ones where you all get to know each other, it‚Äôs different."

I have enough cash flow where it's not an issue, pay card off monthly, no interest charges. Of course, YMMV....just depends on situation.

In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it‚Äôs selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.


Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn‚Äôt. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it‚Äôs unlikely that it‚Äôs anyone at all.

GME SQUEEZE

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî> price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôå üíéüôåüöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ

Look i'm not saying don't buy GME. By all means please do. I'm on your side. Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

But i'm TELLING you! The mining deficit is real! The suppression of the gold and silver price is REAL! There has been delivery wall after delivery wall since April 2020 on the Comex. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THAT! We even have signs that the LBMA is running out:

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! üíéüôåüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**üöÄ** **üöÄüöÄüöÄ** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

117,"Saw this happen myself and it was ridiculous. New customer signup with a massive discount including free HD box rental because he lived in an apartment building that had a contract with us. 

There was a shortage on HD boxes, so they were giving out 4K boxes (which can run 1080p as well) instead. But, because his discount only worked with HD boxes, adding a 4K box to his account threw all sorts of errors. 

Not only would he lose his free rental (through no fault of his own, he didn't even want a 4K box), the system wouldn't let us activate his account. At all. I couldn't even add it on the system and apply a reoccurring discount...it simply would not let me process it. 

I elevated the issue as high as I could and was told it is ""physically impossible"" to activate his account. Wtf? It's just a different model receiver box than is on the building contract, but in order to activate his box they would have to allow ALL contracted buildings to allow 4K boxes.

Nevermind the fact that anytime our system was down or slow, we had to tell the customer that it was ""down for system upgrades."" The level of outright lying that we were expected to do was way too much and I quit shortly after. Out of my ""class"" of 22 people only 6 still work there."

120,"Journalist here. Long-time WSB muppet.

There is a problem with this approach.  Emailing/tweeting a journo your view on a situation just means a random anon is complaining because ""boo hoo the internet morons don't like being called this or attributed to that"".  Sounds like shit, but that's the view most journalists will take when contacted by some complete anon because a lot of us get a lot of shit on the day-to-day from people ALL across the spectrum.

The best individual anons can do is contact a journalist and say ""hey, look I know you wrote/reported this, but I don't think it's an accurate take on the community.  Please could you have a look at the top posts over the past few days involving what you've been reporting and you'll see that the **community consensus** is actually the counter.""

The people who need to speak out to journalists most are the community moderators who ARE able to go on public record as the heads of the forum to speak on behalf of the forum's sentiment and general consensus.  From a journalist's point of view, and as a long-time redditor, this is actually a role I expect moderators to step up to when the time is needed. They can talk about the state of a subreddit to a journalist just as they would stick a pinned post at the top of the  forum -  the difference being, the journalist can actually ask a few more questions to help them understand the community etc better. It's a two-way street. 

Some of us have been dealing with Reuters et al. regarding fact-checking over exactly this throughout the past week.  I have been talking directly with a number of news agencies to inform them and provide evidence that their reports are off/misinformed/jumped the gun on their assumptions and that I, a journalist at a major international news organisation am telling them, the agencies, their reporting is completely fucking wrong.  That's a power move in our industry btw and takes a lot of confidence and self-assurance because it's MY credibility as a reporter.

We've been speaking to MODS across multiple reddit forums (no reply from WSB mods tho) about the silver push and have issued repeated statements concerning the BOT pushes and new accounts attempting to astroturf a false consensus.  

Some of us have small followings on social and it does get lost in the noise.  But, we still keep doing our jobs."

123,"They never anticipated millions of people flooding a bankrupt stock, its completely unheard of, hence the naked shorts. This is an anomaly, and probably the reason they are running to the white house for help. They NEED this stock to be halted otherwise it WILL cause a stock market crash. If these millions of shorted GME stocks are forced to be covered, that would mean billions of dollars would need to be liquidated from ALL OTHER STOCK HOLDINGS of the hedge fund(s), creating a flash crash across the board and all sectors. At this share price, you are talking hundreds of billions of dollars would need to be sold in order to cover all the naked shorts. This is much bigger than we all can even imagine, even the mainstream media is being used as a psychological tool to get us to sell. And with that, I say fuck it, let it all burn. But not until we see the mother of all short squeezes play out. We may have literally broke the stock market."
124,"Yeah for sure, the original play assumed that they would bleed out from the interest and have to cash them all out at once. I‚Äôm sure if someone is funding their interest payments they can stretch it out infinitely. It just depends on how much capital people are willing to lose to uphold the illusion they exited ALL of their positions during the initial spike. Good thing is if they really haven‚Äôt exited all their original short positions, the longer this goes on, the more likely shit will slip out about how corrupt this has all been. Again though I have no idea if I‚Äôm just reading too much into shit, this definitely isn‚Äôt financial advice and I def am not telling anyone to trade based off my posts. This is just me daydreaming aloud.

EDIT: oh noooo they deleted this post too! Hmm wonder why üòÇ"
125,"Alright retards. We have held the line so far. If our diamond hands hold, the squeeze will be coming. 

When we finally see GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ there will be paper hands who will sell at some price points on the way. Most of them will be unretarded GME holders who are holding most of GME floats right now and don't share our love for the stock. Some of them will be fellow retards who have to give their dog surgery or put their girlfriends boyfriend through college, some of them may be you. Whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember.

**WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT STOCK GOES UP IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT STOCK DOESNT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN**

This üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ will keep flying as long as it doesn't hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts. This means that even when GME drops at some point, as long as it doesn't drop low enough for hedges to cover, the fuel will keep coming. There is an easy way to keep this up.

**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**

As far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.

**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**

I have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key. In normal stocks when price falls, people panic and sell until there is nothing left. You retards don't know how to sell and there is way too many of you.

Also I don't fucking know what I'm talking about. I bought my first stock yesterday. This is not financial advice. I'm just a retard. If you listen to me, you're an even bigger retard

The fact that they chose to shut down trading on Monday is no coincidence. Who else hates mondays? Give up? GARFIELD. How does this tie in? Think about it. Garfield is a cat who hates mondays and loves lasagna. Lasagna is a food. Lasagna=tendies, clearly. Now we've established the link to WSB, lets dive a bit deeper. Garfield is a cartoon cat beloved to boomers. Boomers hate WSB, they would instinctively Inverse WSB. Garfield starts with a G, the letter in the compass and square of Freemasonry, clearly a clue. What would be the inverse of G, you ask? A G is a broken loop with an interior facing prong. To inverse the G, we must form a  perfect loop with an outward facing prong? This letter is Q. Have you figured ot all out yet? Q, author of the Qanon posts is actually Jim Davis, author of Garfield. He is not actually a Q clearance government official, but a timetraveler. Go back and read all the old Garfield comics, its all in there. It fills in every puzzlepiece Q leaves out. He has been communicating directly with us from the past via the Garfield comics about future events yet to pass. How does this tie into Robinhood? DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH MAN, ITS ALL IN THE OLD GARFIELD COMICS!!"

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

10 minutes of you retards' life. You already have your life savings in, what's 10 minutes?

Basically he says this:

* He thinks it's cool
* He doesn't really want to get in at this price
* Trying to actually take profit during the moment of the squeeze will be like catching a falling knife, so be careful
* If you're in profits, you may want to take out your initial investment and 'just play with the house's money'
* Only put in what you can afford to lose
* These profits wont last forever. Dont quit your day job

Overall, I dont really see what's so negative.

**ALL HE SAID WAS TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY AND DONT GET CAUGHT BAG HOLDING. WHICH TO MANY OF YOU KOOLADE DRINKING RETARDS SOUNDS LIKE ABSOLUTE FUD**

175,"GME SQUEEZE

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî> price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôå  üíéüôåüöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ  üöÄ

198,"I worked with a lady who was in a semi-supervisory _function_ when I started, but ostensibly she was just a senior grade same role as me. I was hired at ~60% premium over her salary, which I only came to learn years later. Over six years, her responsibilities and authority grew, until the point where a staff of 50 experienced individuals were accountable to her. Her pay? Marginal (~2%) increases over the years. Management insisted she was paid fairly. Spoilers - with no disrespect to the food industry, there are people flipping burgers who make more than she did.

She left six or so years into it, for a job that paid her seven times as much, doing one third as much.

Myself? Independently, I was, of course, pushing for my own pay increases and getting some here and there, but after the first one, nothing to really write home about - but nothing to be super unhappy with. Until, about five years in, I found out what my peers in my subgroup were making. I made a simple projection based on years experience and education that fit the other 4, and asked for 87% of what would fit me on that curve - which, mind, would still have been the lowest by a good amount - in the group. I was told by a VP (!!!) I wasn't worth that amount - unfortunately, I'd gotten to our meeting earlier than he expected and overheard him leaving a desperate VOICemail to his boss, an SVP, asking how much he was authorized to offer me to stay.

It's all over the place, there are so many motivations and factors, it can be unknowable from the other side. I'm a supervisor now, and we have one guy who is in a similar position - he's underpaid (slightly), but we can't utilize the skills he's worth, and while we'd like to retain him, if he needs more money and threatens to walk, we're going to sadly let him go. Our unit just does not have the budget. We would do better taking the productivity hit and regaining some profitability than turning unprofitable.

201,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

212,Or it causes a fucking recession from retards diverting their retirement funds / pension plans into the RISKIEST STOCK OF ALL TIME.
213,"Oof. ""Tenure"" stirs up some very strong connotations for me.  As a former government employee, when it came up it was essentially shorthand for ""doesn't give a hot shit about anything or anyone.  Also, would like to stay at their current experience level and gradually do less and less until they retire.""

I'd rather hear questions like ""what does a 5-year career look like here? How about a 10-year?""

If the path is positive progression and role advancement, it's a good sign.  At my current job, there are career growth training programs for pretty much every level of employee and any number of years of experience.

It's rough finding good people in my field so we value retention.  However, I'm also a big proponent of ""chase your dreams.""  If you want to work for some unicorn or something, go chase it.  I will try to counter-offer, but I'm not going to stop you.  The only thing worse than being the person who didn't chase their dream is being the manager of someone who didn't chase their dream.

My honest hope is that you leave and make **ALL OF THE MONIES**.  This hope is followed closely by my second hope that our place is so rad to work for that once you get tired of the grind, you come back to us for a little sanity, stability, and work-life balance with a bunch of new skills.

227,"probably the last time ill argue this since this thread has traction. Short ladder attacks are not real. Check the good discussion in [This Thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/). Dont downvote it because you disagree with it, absorb it and form your own opinion. Asks questions. Some of us who have been doing this shit for a long long time are still willing to help.

Lets take your evidence 1 by 1.

 > At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices

This happens ALL DAY LONG for almost all tickers and especially done for high volatility tickers. it doesn't matter if its on an [Upswing](https://imgur.com/6WLu5gh) or a [Downswing](https://imgur.com/Hljw71l). This is Algos trading and scalping pennies on the dollar. If you want, I will show you any other symbol that has this exact same result throughout the day. 100 shares is also the default for any trading terminal. Orders through RH or online are generally left blank, but as soon as I open a trade through my terminal, default is 100 shares.

 > Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. :

This was based on nasdaq.com data. Like I just provided as evidence above this is on a trading halt on a [Downward Stock Move](https://imgur.com/7NgmHPL). nasdaq.com takes aggregate data and not true real time. Look at the right of my image, that is the real time trades. You have to pay money to see this information. This is what any stock ticker looks like when you have a massive amount of shares sold. 


 > Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

We had 2 notable halts today (I know there were more but these are easy). 1 of which was the price dropping, 1 was on the rise. Make your own call and judgement on this here. [This is the volume data with the price data](https://imgur.com/yKkMxYY). Tell me why, the drop is a short ladder, but the rise is just normal? To expand on this. The volume of a trade for the market to drop heavily DOES NOT MATTER. All that matters is if the amount of shares being sold is greater than bid depth chart. Thats it. It could take as little as a few thousand shares to break it, it could take millions. 

Please WSB stop saying this, its not real, its not based on logic. Ask questions, and be skeptical of what you read here. The echos are massive, find the opposing opinion and have a discussion. Dont write it off because you dont like it or dont want to hear it.

Edit: Another great read thats only found through controversial. Has the squeeze already happened and how does it compare to VW: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb640x/tired_of_seeing_these_incorrect_you_are_here/

One more Edit: For those of you that want to learn more. Sort by controversial. Front page is a waste of time. Join the discussions, ask questions. There are soooo many smart people here. People with many years of experience from Wall Street to day trading. They will help."

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî> price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

240," A lot of these sales are BS anyway.  I still remember going to HMV a week before and there were some games marked at $20 and $10.  I went back on Black Friday, ALL the games were marked at $20, even games I knew had been $10."
241,"I never get super into Black Friday because I work retail and often long shifts on the day, but this year I did a little shopping after work and used this logic on myself! I bought nearly nothing. Lipsticks which I would have bought at full price so they were a nice surprise, and some candy from a favorite store which I specifically went to. THAT WAS ALL. I was pretty excited and proud of myself.

Edit: Since I work retail, I want to add that while Black Friday still gets a lot of hype, retailers are adding a lot of discounts to the week of and the week after now. And when it's the week before Christmas and they haven't made their plans? They get crazy with it. Don't spend all your dough on Black Friday. It's almost never worth it. "
242,"WHY IS EVERYONE SO FOCUSED ON ROBINHOOD ONLY? 
Yes, fuck those crooks but what about INTERACTIVE BROKERS TD AMERITRADE TASTY WORKS SCHWABB AND MANY OTHERS?
They ALL halted trading!
They‚Äôre all made of the same pile of shit! 
Everyone here should put $1 each and we should create a people‚Äôs brokerage...like a WSB type thing but for buying and selling shares and options and it should be owned by the people and STRICT UNCHANGEABLE founding principles that would never allow anything like this to happen.
And as for the crook fucks in the white house that let this happen, we should have DIRECT DEMOCRACY, where the people vote directly! We don‚Äôt need any sharks running us...the people can decide their own future by themselves"

244,They were ALL complicit.  Big Hedge and the market masters pushed the stop button at just the right times with the right brokers and pulled a minimum of trades to stop the bleeding. The Big Squeeze was stopped at the top... I don't blame the brokers.  I blame the top dogs who had their hands on the stop button.  Don't be fooled.

(just putting this out there for everyone as a reminder and as a quick crash course for any new prospective GMEers)

THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT GME FOR THIS WEEK (first week in March):


1. DFV is a beast and we honestly owe a lot to him.
2. We crushed the $100 resistance level out of the park and very well may have established a NEW FLOOR at $117. Finishing above $120 in regular market hours yesterday was HUUUUUGE as it shows a commitment to the witching hour from the masses.
4. According to people who actually commit their lives to understanding trends in the stock market, our NEXT RESISTANCE LEVEL will be at $126. This may be our next potential fight, and as such we need to be prepared to send it into the stratosphere as soon as we see it start to dip at that level.
5. BUY THE MINI DIPS! Waiting for the ‚Äòright‚Äô moment isn‚Äôt going to happen on a stock like this. Any dip is going to be quickly corrected and if you wana make the most out of things it‚Äôs in your best interest to pump it up as soon as you see negative movement - whether you have stock in GME already or not.
6. The more people that buy more and hold, the better chance we have of getting ourself triple digit+ gains. This means that NO ONE SHOULD SELL TODAY. This is not your typical stock. There is a mission behind this onslaught, and you better understand it. This only works if everyone gets on board and stays on board. 
7. There are PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS on the masses whenever we fuel the jet. Whenever a true stock rocket is taking off, everyone and their mother hops on. That‚Äôs how this works. When someone sees a sure way to make money for free, they do it. It‚Äôs that simple. And it makes sense. Thus, whenever we see a rocket, the more and more we pump it up ‚Äî> the more people jump on ‚Äî> the higher the resistance level we create. Pretty numbers like 150 and 200 are both extremely exciting and terrifying to people. People will doubt those numbers are reachable, but once those barriers are hit there is some involuntary reflex that says ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and more people hop on and FOMO their tits to Valhalla. While this may typically be a less than stellar idea in normal circumstances, it is the best thing that could happen right now. And make no mistake, IT WILL HAPPEN in the curious case of GME.
8. The amount of options in place at 150, 200, and 800 is truly RIDICULOUS. The likelihood of this thing rocketing to a realm where the gains legitimately changes peoples‚Äô lives, their children‚Äôs lives, and their grandchildren‚Äôs lives for the better is not just a pipe dream.
9. This is not going to come without it‚Äôs trials and tribulations. The stock market has ebbs and flows, even with an atypical situation like this. PAPER HANDS ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY. Don‚Äôt get fooled by market manipulation or a slight dip. This thing is going up whether you think it is or not. You can either be a part of history and change your economic sustainability or watch from the sidelines as others have the courage to change their lives forever. DIAMOND HANDS WILL SET YOU FREE.

‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre offered a seat on a rocket ship, don‚Äôt ask what seat! Just get on.‚Äù

It‚Äôs not moving like a stock, it‚Äôs not trading like a stock, it‚Äôs not covered by the media like a stock, so stop talking about healthy pre market and ‚Äúthis looks bullish‚Äù because we have no idea what it looks like. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD, and wait till they bleed out. Their moves are simple and desperate, which means they‚Äôre running out of time. Every pass is a Hail Mary and we will intercept one of them and run it back to our end zone soon enough.

EDIT: I‚Äôm aware my account is new, I jumped on this in January with barely any knowledge (proof in comments) and really loved what you guys were doing so I‚Äôve been buying and holding ever since. I have read a ton of DD and learned everything I could in the past couple months which still is nothing compared to some of you. I appreciate all the love and I think the best part of this group is you can be a true retard like me and in just a short time... well I‚Äôm still retarded, but I like the stock üòú"

264,"> Most people can't.

Just to add onto this: it's not ""most people can't"" in a ""shoot a half-court shot with a basketball"" sort of way, it's ""most people can't"" in a ""mathematical certainty"" sort of way.

Since ""the market"" is the sum total of ALL investors; by definition, the better ""most people"" do, the better the market does. The only way ""most people"" can beat the market is if they do slightly above average at the cost of a minority who lose the same dollar value shared between fewer traders.

Put in other words, it's a zero sum game. If Alice makes a smart trade and gains $100, that's only because Bob lost that same $100 on his trade. The average of their two accounts (ie. ""the market"" in this 2-party-example) has not shifted a penny in either direction but both Alice and Bob will have to subtract the cost of their advisors and the brokerage from their net results.

Edit: clarifying from /u/youngsyr's point - here's the original quote I butchered
""...If you don‚Äôt believe that is what most investors experience, please think for a moment, about the relentless rules of humble arithmetic. These iron rules define the game. As investors, all of us as a group earn the stock market‚Äôs return. ***As a group‚ÄîI hope you‚Äôre sitting down for this astonishing revelation‚Äîwe are average***. Each extra return that one of us earns means that another of our fellow investors suffers a return shortfall of precisely the same dimension. Before the deduction of the costs of investing, beating the stock market is a zero-sum game.""

265,"It isn't your responsibility to do the school's job, but if you do report this to the police or FBI it is worth keeping in mind that the company/employer registered with the school is probably itself the victim of identify theft in this scam. After all, it would be pretty stupid of a scammer to set up a fake company that might be traced back to them in some way. Instead, better to just pick a legit employer and spoof/steal their ID to scam students.

So the school banning this employer is *probably* not going to solve the problem. The scammer could easily spoof one of the hundreds of other employers in the school's system tomorrow and keep right on scamming students.

The real solution is not for the school to ban an individual employer. Instead, you could push the school to set up a multi-step third-party transaction verification system with ALL of the employers in its system, and to inform/train ALL students using the system to ignore any communication that does not come through a verified secure pathway.

In other words, the solution to this problem is for the school to secure their system against fraud, not to ban companies that have themselves been victims of identity theft (because that's probably what happened unless the scammer is a complete moron)."
266,"For us lowly people in Scotland where ¬£750 is ALL of our monthly after tax/after recurring bills budget. Can you elaborate a little on how big your family is, what you and your partner do etc? Is this take home pay average for your age/location/peer group? "
267,"But there's also the flip side -- of the family worried that they're going to have to cart a bunch of stuff that may have sentimental value to them, to the tip, and they're GLAD when they find someone who is really enthusiastic about a few pieces.  I bought some dinette chairs and a small lingerie cabinet from the 40's from an estate sale for $70 total, and they asked what kinds of knick-knacks I liked, because they had plenty of knick-knacks to get rid of... I told them I'd just moved into my first place in a new city with 8 boxes of stuff and had nothing, and would appreciate kitcheny stuff like jugs or serving utensils or bowls... they brought 2 bags worth, and I still use ALL of it a few years later.

I'll admit I'm like the poster about 2nd hand soft furniture, don't want to deal with the possibility of bugs/pee/baby puke, but 2nd hand clothing and bedlinens that can be washed, hard furniture, and kitchen stuff that can be washed is all fair game for me. Heck, even most of my IKEA is from Craigslist - the win being that it's usually at least partially assembled and costs a bit less than buying the flatpack new."

270,"They can help you more over in /r/studentloans - however, things to know 

1) the BDTR is basically for cases of fraud by the college.  The Art Institute is one of those colleges that have made settlements, however it's possible that your particular program was not one of the ones covered.

2) the  streamlined process was just initiated in December by DoEd 

3) they are working through the known cases first as groups and it's possible you might be in one of those groups (these are ones where settlements have been made, state AGs have forwarded lists, etc) 

4) at the moment ALL BDTR FORGIVENESS IS TAXABLE - DoEd has put in a kind word to the IRS, but until someone over there issues a ruling or a law is passed about it, if you get $100K forgiven, you'd owe about $30K to the Treasury.  The IRS is generally pretty decent about setting up payment plans, but still, it's not going to magically go away.

5) you aren't going to hear back until June at the earliest, unless you are in one of the groups they are contacting.

274,"I used to work for AOL and this happens ALL THE TIME.

If you haven't called yet, honestly, make it sound like your father is pretty much senile and had this set from when he was using it and since then hasn't touched a computer...we're ""taught"" that you use the terms of service and that you should be managing your finances so it really isn't up to AOL to monitor your usage or your finances.

They CAN do a credit back to the card, don't let them say otherwise, BUT DO NOT MENTION ANY LAWYERS...the minute you do that, they have to refer you to legal and the conversation stops. 

ALSO, DO NOT CANCEL THE ACCOUNT UNTIL AFTER A REFUND HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. If you do, it locks the CSR out of the account and you can't get anything back. You MIGHT be able to get a years worth of AOL refunded back to your card, but I wouldn't hope for much more.

Dear God if there was ever a time you read all the comments to your post...let it be this."
275,"I became a consultant at the ripe age of 18 when I got fired from a company I worked for since I was 15 (summer warehouse helper).

After they fired me from my whopping $11.25 hourly princely wages, 6 months later they told me they were rethinking and offered me to come back at $12.50 an hour.  One of my old coworkers said shit had hit the fan so I incorporated a few weeks later (was doing it already) and told me they can pay my company $40 an hour.  They did, fired me again after 6 months saying I was too expensive.

So I went to ALL their competitors, straight down the line, and when they rehired my firm when I was 25, they were paying us $120 an hour and I was farming out employees to them.

As far as I know, my old company (I sold it to a young partner 2 years ago) still consults with them, and I wouldn't be surprised if they charge $250-$300 per hour.  No clue, but I could have worked there and gotten crapped on, or I could have turned demand into supply and made a good income with endless writeoffs."

0,"I did. Finally got in on ARK, added more Disney, Apple, AMD and some other else.. But my broke ass can only buy so much dips."
1,"I keep selling parts of my portfolio and buying more gme. 

FUCK TESLA 
FUCK AMD
FUCK NIO
FUCK BLINK

it‚Äôs all going into GME"
2,"Man, I fucked up so big on AMD.

I knew this shit was so undervalued, ryzen was just coming out and the 3 series was gaining insane hype like I've never seen before in the pc enthusiast market, and their stock value just wasn't reflecting that at all, so I bought in at around $9, then for some reason, just decided to sell at $12, even though I had told myself I'm going to hold this for the long term, this stock is going to go crazy, there's no reason it's so far below intel with the hype surrounding their ryzen and threadripper releases, just sold at $12 and completely forgot about it, lmao.

3,"Yes definitely a smart decision. I was about to comment Amd as well. Amd is having their gpu tech and cpu tech in the ps5 and their new thread ripper pro lineup makes it impossible to resist the opportunity. Not to mention that they have a brilliant new CEO and are dominating Intel in the CPU game and Nvidia in the GPU game as far as price to performance. Also, this is kind of a risky investment because if you look at AMD's past you can see that every time they seem like they are doing good their stock price crashes because intel launches a new insane chip. Sorry if my English sucks by the way and I hope this gets chosen man."
4,AMD is the best
5,"I'm going to level with everyone here. I'm not an investor. I took $120 two years ago, bought $AMD stock because I liked the stock and had a hunch their 3rd gen Ryzen, Epyc, and Radeon GPU's would help them continue to steal Intel/Nvidia market share.

I was right and that $120 turned into $386 after 18 months. That stock has been pretty stagnant compared to the gains I was getting (I'm now reading $AMD might be getting shorted which is the reason it's growth has halted, but don't get distracted, $GME is all we like right now), but I was still ahead. I heard about the $GME hype from my brother-in-law who, sadly, bought at about $30/share and sold when it hit $90. A great return, but man if he could have held. He's back in now, but at a much higher cost.

I don't go to the casino that often, but when I do, about $100 is the most I'm willing to lose, and I do *play to lose*. Gambling is entertainment, not a business (unless you own the house). My husband and I make comfortable money for the area we live in. If I can make that $100 last me 1 or 2 hours, I consider that a major win, and the loss just means a little less goes into savings that month, or maybe I don't buy the special edition game and just get the base edition.

So, despite *wanting* to make bank, if $GME does keep dropping and the short squeeze really is over like the news outlets want us to believe (it's not), well, that's $120 of gambling money I made last two years. That's a win in my book. The fact that there is this giant community that will experience the same thing as me just makes the whole effort worth it in my book.

TL;DR, if I can make a huge profit, I'm going to sell. If I lose it all, which I understand is far, far less then what many people have in (1 share at $350.11), I'll consider the two years of gambling with the same $120 totally worth it.

For anyone curious, my current investment, which once peaked at a 222.17% increase over 18 months, has dropped to a 14.94% increase over the same time period since cashing out $AMD and buying $GME. But I'm having fun and the ticket price is well worth the ride."
6,"I'll miss the old state of this sub, too. Long time lurker and lost all my money on AMD, bless su bae. Funniest/most chill place since old school boards."
7,"Anything WSB touches, the price never goes down. See MU AMD."
8,AMD also never goes up
9,"seriously AMD? what the fak?!?! that is a blue fucking chip not some gamble gem, are they trying to tank their biz that hard or what?"
10,"I've been checking it out since AMD was the big thing and Mama Su was the top post of all time. 

Not just this sub but all the meme stock subs have become a lot like Qanon. There's the evil hedgies out to get everyone instead of satanic pedophiles. There's a bunch of ""research"" that's extremely retarded conjecture. Any dissent is just shouted down with catchphrases."
11,"Psh, old wsb was praying to SuBAE for AMC tendies and watching people yolo on AAPL earnings calls.

Edit: I‚Äôm an idiot. AMD."
12,do you remember the guy who maxed out his credit card with cash advances to buy AMD calls?
13,I got me some AMD stocks and options I don‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about üòÇ
14,The dude started with 100k and put an additional 50k into this each year. I was pretty active a few years back when MU and AMD were big meme stocks and I don't remember seeing too much good advice on here. So maybe it was before then. Or I just forgot.
15,All the while AMD beats their earnings report. 
16,AMD
17,"I'm not even close to an expert, and am fairly new myself, but I'd probably sit the GME thing out if you don't have any money to burn. Maybe wait to see what happens on Monday - if GME surges off the back of the gamma squeeze people are predicting, the rest of the market might take a dive because people are worried about the hedge funds selling off holdings for liquidity, just like what happened a day ago before they halted buying. That dip would be a good time to buy into safe stuff like Apple or Microsoft, or even Intel and AMD (though they're not quite as safe). This wouldn't multiply your money, but it's also less likely to delete it, and even if they go down after that, they're almost guaranteed to eventually go back up, barring a full on market correction. Which, not gonna lie, is a real possibility - the last few days have shown the cracks in the financial system, and I wouldn't be entirely surprised if something breaks. The absolute safest bet would probably be to wait a month or two for the instability to go down before entering the market.

That said, if you're looking to YOLO, NOK and BB are pretty cheap right now, and have a non-zero chance of going up both in the short term (hype from WSB and others) and the long term (both companies are poised for growth over the next few years, if all goes well).

**WARNING:** Be *very* careful about acting on any of what I just said, or what anyone else around here is saying; none of us are giving financial advice, since almost none of us are qualified to or have any idea what we're talking about. As always, do your own research."
18,"Gotta disagree here. CPUs and RAM from 2012 underperform in many modern tasks found in gaming and programming.

Between the core-count doubling, the IPC (instructions per click) rising around 5% every generation, and the new competitors in the field (AMD) you're looking at big increases in performance over 5 years.

This is my layman understanding of course, could be a bit wrong. But I notice the difference on my 2013 hardware"
19,"Same. Sold AAPL, AMD etc. calls for GME.

What can I say? I like the stock."
20,Guilty of buying OTM AMD yesterday and completely expiring worthless... Still not selling my GME. I like the stock to much
21,"Exactly. Despite all their efforts, they can‚Äôt unteach us.  Additionally they have now shown us soooooo many strategies.  

Distraction: silver gonna fly! Weed! MicroCap! Their Mom!

Yelling: You all idiots. Well it squoze. Dip shit retail don‚Äôt know what they doing. 

Sabotage: let‚Äôs stop the buying for their sake

Media: WSB and GME = dumb. Nothing to see. 

Bots: AMD, XXX, TUNA, etc. ‚Äúeveryone selling‚Äù

More sabotage: WSB Mods all fired. Chaos

Team Members: SEC, Brokerages, NASDAQ, politicians, HFs

Rumors: WSB is saying shit to OGs. Blah blah blah 

I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm missing others. But, with the enemies tactics revealed, we all want Tendies and we know how to get them."
22,"It's supposedly always a good time to buy if you're playing the long game since the market is always trending up over its existence. As a gamer, back in 2015, I went with what I know, Nvidia and AMD, even after this pull back my dollar cost average is still up over 800%. I have no intention of selling yet."
23,"I've got some AT&T as well set up to compound the dividends into more shares. The AMD and NVIDIA shares were just extra money I could afford to risk. Basically a little over 20% of my paychecks go directly into a savings account, from there about 15% gets automatically distributed into an IRA and another mutual fund. What's left is used to make sure my credit card can be zeroed out. Then around the end of the year I put what's left into the IRA and/or consider putting it into some more stock."

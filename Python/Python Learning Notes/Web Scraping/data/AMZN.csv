0,"Maybe. 

Probably not. Fees are now stabilizing above 30%. For reference, AAPL and AMZN are both 0.3%. 

Conceivably, they can continue to just cover on the down swings. The problem is that the volume is so low with restricted buying and people not selling, any real covering would shoot the price up. We don't know exactly how many shares the shorts have, but if it's still over 100% of float then it will take months. Considering that they've already lost billions, they are hoping that a drop happens soon. 

Realistically, their deadline is Q4 earnings because that's when we'll likely get a big announcement from Gamestop. My goal was to pay down some outstanding credit card debt, I've done that with only a fraction of my position. I'm cool waiting out until long term gains kicks in."
1,Pelosi has yolo'd millions on tech stocks for years.  AMZN calls used to be her bread and butter.
2,"I say split it into 2 50,000 plays. You could do one 50k into options and one 50k into stock. Let's say 50k Disney (DIS) calls expiring in Aug and 50k AMZN or tesla stock, either way both of those will give you a wild ride."
3,Fucking AMZN drivers shitting in the car because they are treated so poorly. GME-commerce wants us to shit on Melvin

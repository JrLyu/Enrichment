Smith’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if there are any catalysts for a price change.  See our latest analysis for A. O. Smith  The stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to my valuation model. It’s trading around 13% below my intrinsic value, which means if you buy A. O. Smith today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe the company’s true value is $79.53, then there isn’t much room for the share price grow beyond what it’s currently trading. Although, there may be an opportunity to buy in the future. This is because A. O. Smith’s beta (a measure of share price volatility) is high, meaning its price movements will be exaggerated relative to the rest of the market.

Future outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. A. O. Smith's earnings over the next few years are expected to double, indicating a very optimistic future ahead. This should lead to stronger cash flows, feeding into a higher share value. Are you a shareholder? It seems like the market has already priced in AOS’s positive outlook, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the track record of its management team. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value? Are you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping tabs on AOS, now may not be the most optimal time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the optimistic prospect is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.

9,"A. O. Smith Corporation AOS is scheduled to report third-quarter results on Oct 26 before market open.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the company’s third-quarter earnings has been revised upward by 2.6% in the past 60 days. The company has a stellar earnings surprise history, having outperformed the consensus estimate in each of the preceding four quarters, the average beat being 10.5%.Let’s see how things are shaping up for A.O. Smith this earnings season. We expect the North America segment’s third-quarter revenues to increase 2.7% from the year-ago reported number, driven by robust demand for commercial and residential water heaters. Our estimate for the segment’s adjusted operating income in the quarter indicates a year-over-year increase of 7.9%.Strong demand for residential and commercial water treatment products in China and higher sales in India are likely to boost the Rest of the World segment’s revenues in the to-be-reported quarter.Also, A. O. Smith’s third-quarter results are expected to reflect the benefits of improving supply chains and higher shipments. For the third quarter, we expect AOS’ revenues to increase 1.7% from the year-ago reported figure. Our estimate for the company’s earnings indicates a 10.7% rise from the year-ago reported number.However, increasing steel costs are likely to partly affect AOS’ bottom line in the third quarter.

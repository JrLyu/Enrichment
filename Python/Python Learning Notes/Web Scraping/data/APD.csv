That’s understandable as markets go through down cycles and it’s applicable even for specific sectors. I believe that the correction in hydrogen stocks is a good opportunity to accumulate for the next few years. Some of the best hydrogen stocks are poised to deliver multi-bagger returns due to stellar revenue growth. To put things into perspective, global “spend on producing hydrogen for energy purposes from now until 2050 will be USD 6.8tn, with an additional USD 180bn spent on hydrogen pipelines.” The growth story will span over several decades. The revenue for some of the best hydrogen companies is the tip of the iceberg. Let’s explore three hydrogen stocks that look attractive for long-term exposure. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com Plug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) stock has plunged by 61% in the last 12 months. I believe that PLUG stock is attractively valued considering the Company’s long-term growth outlook. It’s worth noting that the short interest in the stock remains high at 23%. I would not be surprised with a big short squeeze rally from current levels of $6.6. Coming to the financial roadmap, Plug Power has ambitious targets. For the current year, the Company expects revenue of $1.2 billion. The guidance is for revenue of $6 billion and $20 billion in 2027 and 2030 respectively. Further, Plug Power expects a gross margin of 35% by 2030. While the targets are steep, industry tailwinds are positive. It’s a risk worth taking and multibagger returns seem likely. In August, the Company showcased the world’s first 15TPD green hydrogen plant. Business progress has been in the right direction and I don’t see financing growth as a concern.

The 2.47% dividend yield stock looks attractive at a forward price-earnings ratio of 24.4. With aggressive investments planned towards building the hydrogen economy, Air Product is likely to be a value creator. Air Products and AES have agreed to build the largest green hydrogen facility in North Texas. With an investment of $4 billion, the facility will have a capacity of 200mt/day. The Company will also be constructing a 1.2 million tonne per year green hydrogen facility in Saudi Arabia, which will be the largest in the world. Additionally, the Company is investing in a blue hydrogen hub in Western Canada. The key point to note is that Air Products has high financial flexibility and I expect continued investments. This sets the stage for healthy revenue growth and cash flow upside in the next five years. Source: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock Bloom Energy (NYSE:BE) stock has remained depressed for year-to-date. It’s among the hydrogen stocks that are worth accumulating. As an overview, Bloom Energy has a solid oxide platform for distributed generation of electricity and hydrogen. The Company’s Solid Oxide Fuel Cells have already been deployed in applications across healthcare, data centers, critical manufacturing, and retailers. The solid oxide platform already has more than 700 installations globally. With a big addressable market, the growth outlook is positive. For Q2 2023, Bloom Energy reported revenue growth of 23.8% on a year-on-year basis to $301.1 million. However, Bloom Energy reported an operating loss of $54.5 million for the quarter. The positive is that the Company has guided for a positive non-GAAP operating margin for 2023. With operating leverage, I expect sustained margin expansion. As of Q2 2023, Bloom reported cash and equivalents of $900 million. This provides the Company with high financial flexibility to invest in deepening the product pipeline. Some of the recent launches include Series 10 and an enhanced CHP solution for net zero heating and cooling.

1,"Investors looking for stocks in the Chemical - Diversified sector might want to consider either Compass Minerals (CMP) or Air Products and Chemicals (APD). But which of these two companies is the best option for those looking for undervalued stocks? Let's take a closer look. There are plenty of strategies for discovering value stocks, but we have found that pairing a strong Zacks Rank with an impressive grade in the Value category of our Style Scores system produces the best returns. The proven Zacks Rank emphasizes companies with positive estimate revision trends, and our Style Scores highlight stocks with specific traits. Right now, Compass Minerals is sporting a Zacks Rank of #2 (Buy), while Air Products and Chemicals has a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold). Investors should feel comfortable knowing that CMP likely has seen a stronger improvement to its earnings outlook than APD has recently. However, value investors will care about much more than just this. Value investors also tend to look at a number of traditional, tried-and-true figures to help them find stocks that they believe are undervalued at their current share price levels. The Value category of the Style Scores system identifies undervalued companies by looking at a number of key metrics. These include the long-favored P/E ratio, P/S ratio, earnings yield, cash flow per share, and a variety of other fundamentals that help us determine a company's fair value. CMP currently has a forward P/E ratio of 17.60, while APD has a forward P/E of 22.08. We also note that CMP has a PEG ratio of 0.31. This figure is similar to the commonly-used P/E ratio, with the PEG ratio also factoring in a company's expected earnings growth rate. APD currently has a PEG ratio of 2.16. Another notable valuation metric for CMP is its P/B ratio of 2.11. Investors use the P/B ratio to look at a stock's market value versus its book value, which is defined as total assets minus total liabilities. By comparison, APD has a P/B of 4.10. These metrics, and several others, help CMP earn a Value grade of A, while APD has been given a Value grade of C. CMP is currently sporting an improving earnings outlook, which makes it stick out in our Zacks Rank model. And, based on the above valuation metrics, we feel that CMP is likely the superior value option right now. Want the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

3,"We’re in the midst of a major economic transition, one that may eventually match the changes of the Industrial Revolution. The change, of course, is the advent of the green economy, and the switch from fossil fuel energy sources to renewable energy. While wind and solar power are soaking up the headlines, a more plausible long-term green power source is already near at hand: hydrogen. Hydrogen is the most abundant of all the chemical elements, and also the simplest by molecular structure. It is found everywhere; with carbon and oxygen, it forms the basis of the organic compounds that make life possible, and in the heart of the sun, its nuclear fusion generates the light and energy on which we all depend. Without hydrogen, we couldn’t exist. Hydrogen also offers high potential as fuel. It is highly reactive, and amenable to our technological control. As a fuel, it can be burned with oxygen to release both light and heat; as an element in fuel cells, it can generate clean electricity. Being so common, relatively simple technological processes – electrolysis powered from renewable sources and steam methane reforming associated with carbon capture and storage, to produce ‘green’ and ‘blue’ hydrogen respectively – can produce hydrogen at scale for industry and utilities. A recent report from Deutsche Bank’s David Begleiter points out that, due to recent initiatives of the Biden Administration, it pays for companies to produce clean hydrogen. The Department of Energy has announced $7 billion in funding for regional clean hydrogen hubs in the US, and the US government is working to promote demand for clean hydrogen. Begleiter, a 5-star analyst, has also been pointing out stocks that stand to gain as hydrogen use expands. We’ve used the TipRanks platform to look up the details on two of those picks, producers and distributors of industrial gasses, that are leaders in the sector – and that investors should watch them closely. Linde plc (LIN) Linde, the first company we’re looking at, was founded in Germany and traces its roots back to 1879. Today, the firm operates with a global footprint and has become the leading provider of atmospheric gases – argon, nitrogen, and oxygen – for industrial use, as well as other pure gases such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, ammonia, and methanol. The company’s products have found uses in aquaculture, agriculture, chemistry, construction, electronics, healthcare; there is hardly a sector of our economy that does not make use of gases in some way. All of this isn’t just big business, it is huge. Linde has a market cap of $185 billion and generated over $33 billion in total revenues last year. Its gas business is supplemented by engineering services, in separating and pressurizing gases, developing and building systems for the liquefaction and storage of gases, thermal processes for recovering gases from industrial feedstocks, and developing the specialist equipment for the manufacture of industrial gases. When it comes to hydrogen, Linde has the long-term experience, the technical expertise, and the existing infrastructure to rapidly generate the gas in large quantities, to store it safely, and to ship it when and where it is needed. Linde already provides hydrogen for several industrial applications, including aviation, heavy industry, mobility, and power buffering. Linde’s oversized footprint in the industrial gas niche has been beneficial for both the company and its investors. Earnings are trending upward in recent quarters, and the firm’s stock is up 18% year-to-date. In its last quarterly financial release, for 2Q23, Linde showed an adjusted EPS of $3.57, beating the forecast by 9 cents and growing 15% from the prior-year quarter. The top-line result, however, was down ~5% year-over-year and missed the estimates by $500 million. For analyst Begleiter, all of this can be summed up in a simple list of achievements: “With Linde executing well on pricing and productivity, 18 consecutive earnings beats, a highly resilient business model, a $50B-plus and growing slate of clean energy investment opportunities and valuation a fair 27.0x ’23E EPS and 16.6x ’23E EBITDA, we reiterate our Buy rating.” That Buy rating comes along with a $450 price target suggesting ~19% one-year upside potential for the stock. (To watch Begleiter’s track record, click here) Overall, Linde gets a Strong Buy consensus rating from the Street’s analysts, supported by a decisive 13 to 1 Buy-over-Hold margin among the 14 analyst reviews on record. The shares are trading for $379.24, and the $434.86 average target price points toward ~15% upside on the one-year horizon. (See Linde stock forecast) Air Products and Chemicals (APD) Next up is Air Products and Chemicals, a Pennsylvania-based industrial gas firm. Like Linde above, Air Products provides a wide range of gases, including hydrogen, helium, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide, as well as the common atmospheric gases argon, nitrogen, and oxygen, along with the engineering and storage expertise to use them efficiently. The company’s products are found across the economy, in electronics, food and beverage, cement and lime, pulp and paper, rubber and plastics, food and medicine – the list is nearly endless. By the numbers, Air Products has an impressive footprint. The company operates in over 50 countries, employing more than 21,000 people to serve over 200,000 industrial customers. APD generates its products in a network of 750+ facilities and can transport gases through 1,800 miles of pipelines. The company posted $12.7 billion in sales for fiscal year 2022 and has ~$64 billion market cap. Earlier this year, Air Products announced that it had ‘closed the deal’ on an agreement with two partners, ACWA Power and NEOM Green Hydrogen, in the development of the world’s largest green hydrogen production facility. Air Products and NEOM concluded contracts worth $6.7 billion for engineering, procurement, and construction activities in the project. This announcement was only the latest in Air Products’ hydrogen activities. The company is deeply connected to the North American green hydrogen industry as part of its work to create a decarbonized economy. Air Products reported its results for Q3 of the fiscal year 2023 in early August, showing revenue of $3.03 billion. This was down 5% year-on-year and came in $260 million below expectations. However, the company’s bottom line was stronger. Earnings have been rising gradually over the past several quarters, and the fiscal Q3 2023 bottom line was $2.98, up 13.7% from fiscal Q3 2022 and 7 cents better than had been anticipated. Once again, we’re looking at a gas stock that Deutsche Bank’s David Begleiter sees in a generally bullish position. The analyst writes of Air Products, “With a large, green (blue/green hydrogen, carbon capture, SAF) and project backlog underpinning Air Products’ energy transition growth strategy and providing a line of sight to 10%-plus EPS growth over the next 5 years, a growing track record of large project execution and valuation a fair 22.3x ’24E EPS, we reiterate our Buy rating.” Looking ahead, Begleiter gives the shares a price target of $330 to go along with the Buy rating, implying a 15% potential gain in the coming year. Zooming out, we find that Air Products shares get a Moderate Buy consensus from the Street, based on 7 reviews that break down to 4 Buys and 3 Holds. The stock’s average price target of $328.71 suggests a gain of 14.5% from the current selling price of $287.12.

5,"In this article, we discuss best dividend aristocrats according to analysts. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance, and go directly to read 10 Best Dividend Aristocrats According to Analysts.  With the stock market facing ongoing fluctuations, investors are experiencing the frustration of seeing their profits disappear. For instance, the S&P 500 increased by 19.5% from January to July 2023 but has since fallen by 6%. Considering the Federal Reserve's inclination to maintain higher interest rates for an extended period, negative investor sentiment, and the typical seasonal decline, it appears that the momentum of this summer's market rally might continue to weaken as we enter the fall season. According to analysts, investors can mitigate their losses by investing in dividend stocks. Dividend stocks are already a popular choice among investors due to their reliability in providing a steady stream of income. Between 1993 and the end of last year, the S&P 500 index increased by 777%. But with dividends included, the S&P 500 grew by over 1,400% during that same time frame. In addition to this, when we examine the performance of the S&P 500 on a decade-by-decade basis, we can see that the role of dividends in contributing to the total return has fluctuated over time. From 1930 to 2021, dividends accounted for an average of 40% of the S&P 500's total return. A recent study conducted by Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, found that stocks that pay dividends tend to perform better in the long run and are more resilient during market downturns. Here are some comments from the analyst, taken from his interview with Business Insider this month. ""Our economists are of the view that inflation will continue to slow from elevated levels over the next 12 months. That backdrop is supportive of owning dividend-related factors and defensive dividend payers, in particular."" He further said: ""Dividends provide a positive return cushion with a notable portion of outperformance for payers versus non-payers coming during periods of market volatility. Specifically, the majority of outperformance comes during large market pullbacks such as 2000, 2008, 2015, and 2020."" The Business Insider report also revealed that stocks that started paying dividends in 2000 have outperformed the market since then. The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG), Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL), and PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) have been raising their dividends for decades, becoming top choices for investors. In this article, we will discuss some of the best dividend stocks to buy according to analysts.

We then ranked these stocks according to their average analyst ratings from Yahoo Finance, where a lower score signifies a better rating. The ""Recommendation Rating"" is a way to assess stocks. It uses a scale from 1 to 5, with each number indicating a different recommendation: Strong Buy Buy Hold Underperform Sell From this ranking, we selected the stocks with scores of 2.4 or less. Average Analyst Rating Score: 2.4 Federal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is an American real estate investment trust company that specializes in the ownership, management, development, and operation of retail and mixed-use properties.

The collective value of these stakes is roughly $125 million. Average Analyst Rating Score: 2.3 Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) is a multinational corporation that specializes in food distribution and related services. It is one of the world's largest foodservice distributors, serving a wide range of customers in the food service industry.

The number of hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owning stakes in Sysco Corporation (NYSE:SYY) grew to 39 in Q2 2023, from 34 in the previous quarter.

Average Analyst Rating Score: 2.3 Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV) is an American diversified industrial manufacturing company that operates across a range of industries. The company has been increasing its dividends for over 67 years, which is one of the longest streaks in the market. It currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.51 per share. With a dividend yield of 1.45% as of October 9, DOV is one of the best dividend stocks on our list. As of the close of Q2 2023, 34 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey owned investments in Dover Corporation (NYSE:DOV), up from 30 in the previous quarter. The collective value of stakes owned by these hedge funds is over $387.4 million. Average Analyst Rating Score: 2.3 PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) is a global industrial company that specializes in the production and distribution of paints, coatings, and specialty materials.

The company has been rewarding shareholders with regular dividends for 124 years and has raised its payouts for 51 consecutive years. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.02%, as of October 9. ClearBridge Investments mentioned PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) in its Q2 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say: “We were fairly active in the quarter as market dislocations allowed us to be opportunistic, while focusing on companies with stronger moats, better pricing power, more predictable long-term growth and higher returns. In the materials sector we exited PPG Industries, Inc. (NYSE:PPG) and initiated a position in Sherwin-Williams. While both companies operate in the paint and coating industry and are benefiting from improving margins as raw material prices have come down of late, we believe Sherwin-Williams’ dominant retail footprint affords it better pricing power through the cycle. The company provided conservative 2023 guidance and has been successfully gaining market share in the pro segment. While PPG has more European and industrial exposure, Sherwin-Williams’ residential and more domestic focus should also benefit the company as housing indicators appear to be troughing. Weak housing in the face of higher mortgage rates caused Sherwin-Williams stock to sell off in the first quarter, creating a compelling investment opportunity for long-term focused fundamental investors.” Average Analyst Rating Score: 2.3 An American multinational consumer goods company, The Procter & Gamble Company (NYSE:PG) is next on our list of the best dividend stocks. The company's dividend growth streak currently stands at 67 years and it pays a quarterly dividend of $0.9407 per share. The stock has a dividend yield of 2.62%, as of October 9.

If you want to skip our discussion on the natural resources market, head directly to 5 Best Natural Resources ETFs To Buy.  As the world accelerates its efforts to innovate and transform itself in technology and lifestyle, our dependence on natural resources only grows. The natural resources sector is made up of a number of industries involved in the research, mining, extraction, commercialization, and utilization of naturally occurring materials. These resources can be classified into three main categories – renewable resources, non-renewable resources, and environmental services and conservation. This article discusses ETFs involved across all these categories.  According to PwC, the revenue for the top 40 mining companies amounted to roughly $711 billion in 2022. Coal remained the largest contributor, with over 28% of total revenues being attributed to coal mining. With the inflation rising and the industry focused on a net-zero emissions policy, the demand for minerals continues to rise. To this effect, roughly 66% of the top 40 mergers & acquisitions in 2022 have been critical-mineral deals. Since 2003, the market capitalization for the top 40 miners has tripled from $400 billion to $1.2 trillion in 2022. Over the past few years, the world has rightfully shifted its focus on generating clean energy. This rapid focus has caused governments to legislate to secure mining supply, while introducing fund initiatives that help stabilize mineral supplies. The Global Mining Leader for PwC Australia, Mr. Paul Bendall, stated:  “Mining is playing a fundamental role in underpinning the global transition to clean energy, but the path ahead is rocky. A net zero world requires more mined critical minerals, not less, and the flow of industry dealmaking clearly reflects this. But the increasing rise of geopolitics as an influencing factor in global mining may complicate operations in an increasingly complex world with new actors.” Despite the governmental efforts, the inflationary pressure and other global supply chain issues have certainly impacted the natural resources industry as a whole. As per PwC’s annual CEO survey, over 41% of respondents believe that their business would not be profitable in a decade, if these conditions were to continue. The Inflation Reduction Act committed an additional $40 billion dollars for the generation of clean energy. With the government’s injection of public funds in the sector, the industry remains concerned about generating an adequate level of return on these investments. According to the International Energy Agency, the total investment in clean energy is forecasted to grow to $1.7 trillion during this year.

1,"GET THIS FUCKING (speculative) DD OUT THERE:

&#x200B;

Guys think about what is REALLY happening here!!

The hedge funds dont matter that much, yes they are the degenerates that think every trade they make will never go tits up. The reason this trade is working is because SHARES THAT DONT EVEN EXIST HAVE BEEN SHORTED!!

Who made this risky ass loan (because shorting shares is borrowed shares meaning loaned)???

Why are brokerages restricting/suspending trading shares/options/ANYTHING related to the underlying? They shouldn't give a fuck if you lose money right? THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE AT RISK!!! THEY MADE RISKY FUCKING LOANS THINKING IT CANT GO TITS UP.

This is why GME is the only play, its the only one shorted above 100% float!! THEY ARE CAUGHT WITH THERE FUCKING PANTS DOWN AND ARE DESPERATE TO NOT GET CAUGHT.

WASSUP LEIMAN BROS!!!??!?!

Ahem. Not financial advice, I just like commenting on shit and love this stock"

7,"I’m a silent browser on reddit but the news turned me to this sub. The ‘08 recession collapsed my family (6 boys, parents with no college and new credit) so far into poverty that my parents will never climb out. Banks don’t touch them with a ten foot pole, they hit rock bottom and that’s how I grew up. I’m doing great after climbing out of the lower class but my younger brothers still have a mountain climb to get out of that dark shadow. YOU PEOPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL; FUCK THESE BASTARDS.

Edit for anyone who cares; I grew up sleeping on the floor of my grandmothers house in a bedroom with all my brothers. Fucking poor.


Edit again: GUYS THE AWARDS ARE SO NICE BUT PLEASE SAVE YO MONIES FOR THE STONKS!!!!"
8,"I was little when the recession hit, but I remember bits and pieces. I remember my grandparents losing their car dealerships, my dad losing his job at said dealerships, my Mom returning to work as a teacher. I didn't know the extent to how bad things were until recent years. I remember one day in freshman year of high school, I was having a mental and emotional breakdown. My dad leveled with me in a way he never had before. He admitted to me that when we lost the dealerships, he went on unemployment, and things were getting pretty bad. He admitted to me (something I don't even think he told my mother) that he was extremely close to just getting into a ""car accident"" and supporting us with his life insurance.

I've had the fortune of not actually seeing him in that state, and I intend to keep it that way. I'm not a tankie or anything, I fully believe in and support capitalism, but I genuinely hope these mushroom dick bankers and pig fuckers on Wall Street choke on my testicles. I don't like to believe that people in this world are cartoonishly evil, but I know these knob-slobbering chodes have absolutely no problem demolishing the lives of millions just so they can get another yacht.

And I really hope this is it, I really hope this is the beginning of a takedown of these predatory miscreants. I pray that this isn't just some blip in history where a bunch of assholes on the internet made a mess of things. This will be a revolution in which the masses reap their rewards. Not from violence and riots, not from meaningless protests that make school kids think they're revolutionaries, not from the government making taxes and legislation, but from *SHEER. UNADULTERATED. AUTISM.* WE'LL TAKE BACK WHATS OURS BY TAKING THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE FREE MARKET, MAKING IT INTO A FIST, AND SHOVING UP THEIR ASS! SORRY MR. HEDGE FUND MANAGER, BUT YOU ARE GONNA LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY! YOUR GONNA HAVE TO GO WITHOUT HOOKERS FOR A WHILE CAUSE ITS GONNA BE US WHO WILL BE FUCKING THE WHORES WITH TENDIES SHOWERING DOWN ON US!

**Either they are:**

**1) Incredibly retarded and dont deserve to be in control of other people’s money, thus deserve to go bankrupt and let a more honest and intelligent hedge fund take their place or;**

**2) They think we are all “dumb money” cowards and that they can outsmart us and our position by swinging their big money nuts around in the media and the SEC to get their corrupt crony buddies to shut us down and take our mortgage payments, student loan payments, and children’s college funds.**

Most retail traders (You) lack the ability to trade before and after the market opens/closes. This is why it is currently down. Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock. It will happen every single evening for the next several days so be prepared for this. If it is to stressful for you, please put away your phone/computer and check again in the morning.

22,"My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

Melvin is 100% in this sub, they're definitely posting trying to influence the ""herd. ""  They're doing just like they do to boomers through NBC and newspapers etc. But, they're ALSO reading posts trying to go along with the herd. I think they have realized that if you follow the meme stocks, you can make money, like we all have and are also using it as a resource that way. That's key, after this situation they've had to respect the sub and are going to be playing along with us too, it's just the only logical thing. 

There's been a silver gang for as long as I have been in this sub and some posts are of course legitimate retards. We ARE NOT a group of buyers, but a bunch of individuals with varying opinions and levels of retardation. Those new here think that it's always like the GME or fuck you posting, but that's new because of the situation.

47,"People need to understand that these posts hit r/all regularly, and as much as 🚀🚀💎✋ is a funny meme, that these a-holes are still WAY oversold, and that we ain't fking selling.

It's dropping because they are opening new shorts (borrowing shares then selling) and this puts downward pressure on the stock. They are short ladder attacking. Think of this as 2 dudes passing shares back and forth over and over for 1 dollar less each time. The latest trade gets updated and it looks like the price is falling, but it's really just two dudes being idiots. They are trying to create FAKE volume in order to scare people to sell, creating REAL volume.

The sad thing is, it probably worked a bit today. The other thing is, myself and many others BOUGHT MORE. Why? BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL WAY OVERSHORTED.

Also, don't discount the fact that the whole fucking world came together to save gamestop, and there is massive ""social citizen"" collatoral that Gamestop has gained in this massive event. That singlehandedly means that any smart CEO will capitalize on this and turn Gamestop into an e-sports giant.

There were memes about Ninja turtles growing up and taking care of their old pal Splinter, and those memes are real. The world has got gamestop and we will help it recover.

Why does this matter? Because it's VERY LIKELY that $100 share price is very very good entry point, not just to fight the over-shorted stock, but also simply as a long term hold.

These prices just make it easier to go long on GME, and that actually being a smart play.

Let these greedy fucks bleed out, the lower this goes, the more I buy, and many others also. And there's only 65M shares. That's 1 share per 65 million people. I myself represent hundreds of those people. How many others also do?

TLDR, the language in this subreddit is a meme and to an outsider makes us look stupid. But there are a lot of smart people here, who understand that today changed everything. And the thing that changed is that it is VERY EASY to hold $100 GME for FUCKING DECADES"
48,"To be clear: a lot of advice on the internet about how to handle this. I’m going to give you a pre-step to do.

Assuming you have lined something else up, do the following before saying anything to your employer about moving on. WARNING: DO. OT THREATEN TO LEAVE OR OTHERWISE INDICATE YOU ARE LEAVING, IF ASKED, DENY DENY AND DENY

Make an appt with your direct supervisor and whoever authorizes raises. Ask the following question: 

“What does the next 5 years look like in terms of my progression at this company? I would like to be making $XXX,XXX and am currently making $YY,YYY...what do I need to do to get there? I feel that my contributions (list major specifics, with backup for pushback here) are contributing to the bottom line and would like to have more of an impact to continue to grow along with the company.”

That’s it. The other thing you might ask for is an equity stake in the future of the company, be that stock options, or accumulating ownership percentage.

Expect your supervisors to make you feel small with cheesy little details, late reports, and every minor transgression. Your response should be “I understand those deficiencies and will work on them, are you saying my job is at risk because of them?”

If you want to further this script, I’ll play. I think I may have recently missed an equity share by bailing too early."
49,"Shits complicated.  A team being in a bad spot when someone leaves does not automatically mean that team was understaffed.  Even if they ARE understaffed, it doesn't mean they haven't been trying to fill a spot."
50,"I’ve been on the sidelines of this as well. In fact, I had $BB in my portfolio from a play weeks before, and when I saw that WSB was jumping in to pump it up, I immediately sold. Why? I’ve worked in investment banking compliance and regulatory enforcement for years. I was laid off, but planned to return to the same field at some point. I’m trading for the first time in years (I’m not really allowed to while employed) and didn’t want to get caught in the SEC dragnet that is likely coming. 

But something in me snapped. I closed positions that I had done plenty of *real* DD/fundamentals analysis and had planned to hold through the pandemic.

Look i'm not saying don't buy GME. By all means please do. I'm on your side. Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

Everything that we have experienced this past week is evidence of one thing, and that is fear. FEAR, not on our behalf, but on the other side of the playing field. In any game, your opponents reactions is a tell-tale sign of where he stands in his position. CITADEL and any other players on the opposition have lost and risked losing more than 70 BILLION in an effort to avoid the INEVITABLE. They've restricted the BUYING POWER OF THE MAJORITY in an effort to suppress the INESCAPABLE. Do not decide whether we are headed in the right direction based on our current position, instead base your judgement on how the other players are handling the game.

So, welcome Mr/Mrs Journalist, Reporter person. We are all dumb apes that like the stock."
88,"Journalist here. Long-time WSB muppet.

There is a problem with this approach.  Emailing/tweeting a journo your view on a situation just means a random anon is complaining because ""boo hoo the internet morons don't like being called this or attributed to that"".  Sounds like shit, but that's the view most journalists will take when contacted by some complete anon because a lot of us get a lot of shit on the day-to-day from people ALL across the spectrum.

The best individual anons can do is contact a journalist and say ""hey, look I know you wrote/reported this, but I don't think it's an accurate take on the community.  Please could you have a look at the top posts over the past few days involving what you've been reporting and you'll see that the **community consensus** is actually the counter.""

The people who need to speak out to journalists most are the community moderators who ARE able to go on public record as the heads of the forum to speak on behalf of the forum's sentiment and general consensus.  From a journalist's point of view, and as a long-time redditor, this is actually a role I expect moderators to step up to when the time is needed. They can talk about the state of a subreddit to a journalist just as they would stick a pinned post at the top of the  forum -  the difference being, the journalist can actually ask a few more questions to help them understand the community etc better. It's a two-way street. 

Some of us have been dealing with Reuters et al. regarding fact-checking over exactly this throughout the past week.  I have been talking directly with a number of news agencies to inform them and provide evidence that their reports are off/misinformed/jumped the gun on their assumptions and that I, a journalist at a major international news organisation am telling them, the agencies, their reporting is completely fucking wrong.  That's a power move in our industry btw and takes a lot of confidence and self-assurance because it's MY credibility as a reporter.

We've been speaking to MODS across multiple reddit forums (no reply from WSB mods tho) about the silver push and have issued repeated statements concerning the BOT pushes and new accounts attempting to astroturf a false consensus.  

Some of us have small followings on social and it does get lost in the noise.  But, we still keep doing our jobs."

MODS please don't delete! This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got deleted, if this one does too, spread the word.  
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but Robinhood who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when Robinhood's order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME can still be squoze for all the aforementioned reasons above. Thank you for taking your time to read my DD, please mods do not delete."
93,"I disagree, I’d say it’s a long shot not because the numbers don’t add up but simply because of the game we’re playing. Make no mistake, it is the little guy vs the big guy and we ARE the little guy and we’re playing the big guys game. To say it’s inevitable because the numbers add up is naive imo. Yes the numbers and DD (and hopefully the SI on the 9th) point to hedge cunts being overextended on shorts and being big gains and potential on a squeeze, but without the proper momentum and attention/publicity, there could also easily not be a squeeze. I think staying in the game and holding is the right move, but just like in blackjack and poker, making the right move doesn’t always mean you’re going to win"

In my experience, bullys cover their fear with threats. Thats what this all is right now. EMPTY THREATS. They are desperate and scared cause now the whole playground is on to them and they about to get their asses WHOOPED!

They're acting like we never took a hit before, like we're scared of a little scuffle cause they don't live in the streets we grew up on. They're SCARED of being broke and eating ramen daily to make ends meet. MOTHER FUCKERS DONT KNOW WE ALREADY THERE LIVING IT! 

They saw fearlessness last week and are trying to break us of that. What they don't get is that we aren't fearless, WE ARE JUST RETARDED AND STOCKS GO BRRRRR!!

You cant just excuse everything you don't like as some sort of hedge fund deep state manipulating the market like hell (Melvin literally has 33 employees)

Have fun watching the prediction of your payout day keep getting pushed back from Friday to Monday to the 5th to even farther with no noticeable increase in average  value. I'm fairly sure they repositioned Thursday.

Have you considered that because you invested a lot of money a sort of confirmation bias is kicking in? The idea that we must keep buying buying buying is just making you want to be in a confirmation echo chamber more as you have more to lose.

However, I assure you, they do not loose often because the system is rigged in their favor and they play knowing THEY ARE THE HOUSE. Ask yourself, when is the last time a CEO, CFO, COO, or a Board member of a major bank went to jail for stealing millions or even billions from us? Never, because the laws that the Congress write protect them. That’s right our fucking elected representatives Democrats and Republicans alike write laws to protect these Corporate assholes from being arrested and thrown in jail. Just like the Representatives and Senators write laws that protect themselves. They can lie through their teeth as long as they do it on the Congress and Senate floor they have immunity, BAM! 

The only way to beat them is to beat them at their own game just like we did with $GME except this time we have the fore knowledge that they will try anything and everything to fuck with us. Perhaps this time we go strictly cash, no margin. Yep, I know no moon shot money but they also can’t fuck with your shares either. Just one suggestion. I’m sure there are many more options and opportunities to strike back at the evil empire. God Bless and Godspeed."
223,"Ladies and gentlemen, Democrats and Republicans, you’ve been duped

Over the last 10 years, we’ve been told our country is getting increasingly divided. For the last 4 years, we’ve been told that Civil War was around the corner. For the 12 months, we’ve been worried about a pandemic, lockdowns, losing jobs, a divisive election, an insurrection. 

The truth is – we’ve been fighting the same enemy this whole time. We just didn’t know it.

To the liberals here – how often have you worried about the gap between the rich and the poor? The 1% vs the 99%? Wages stagnating? Inequality? Environmental destruction from multinational corporations? We were all listening to Green Day not too long ago, railing against the establishment. Are you not a little suspicious of the number of corporations that have suddenly changed their “values” to be progressive? Are you not suspicious over Big Tech’s rush to censor dissent? 

To the conservatives here – you have been worried about your jobs being outsourced overseas, about your factories and manufacturing base disappearing, about the destruction of the family unit (particularly in rural communities). You wanted to drain the swamp. You’ve worried over the rise of China and our trade dependence on them. Yet so much of the GOP’s policies have favoured the corporations who have abandoned you for decades. 

We (the liberal and conservative base) have been worried about the same thing. We’ve been fighting the same foe this whole time. And yet we’ve both allowed the Corporatist Media and Party Establishments to pull the wool over our eyes. We have been so focused on fighting each other for years, blinded by our (skewed) perception that “the other side” was working with the enemy, we failed to see who was behind us this whole time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all Gandalf, just realizing now that Saruman is in league with Sauron. 

This is beyond hedge fund predators. This is the 1%. The swamp. Crony capitalists. “The man”. Whatever you want to call them. They’ve been making trillions of dollars during this pandemic. They’ve been gambling with your money for decades, causing the near collapse of our economy in 2008. They’ve been milking you dry. They’ve been short-selling and squeezing the life of so many companies, losing millions of jobs, to the point where companies like Sears can’t even pay the pensions of retirees. Speaking of that - there are no pensions anymore. There is no minimum wage. All wages have been stagnating for decades. Where is your future? They claim the stock market is doing well. The economy is growing. And yet, where are you? Stuck? Still? Do you have a home yet? Are your student loans paid off yet? Will you ever afford to have a family? WHERE IS YOUR FUTURE. 

Jeff Bezos has enough money to pay $50,000 to 4 million people. The 20 wealthiest Americans have $1 TRILLION worth of wealth. That’s $50,000 for 20 million people. Or $3400 for 300 million Americans. Sure beats the $600 we got! Their world is completely different from yours. Everything in this system is rigged in their favour. We can have a global pandemic, a lockdown, and yet they can be richer now than they’ve ever been. We could have a Civil War (which is what they wanted?) and they could come out of it completely unscathed. Do you know how many billionaire’s own doomsday bunkers? They don’t have to go underground. They can take their yachts and travel the world until shit blows over. They can rest easy in their Switzerland-based chalet’s or their countryside villa’s in southern France. They don’t need you. 

We should be ashamed of ourselves. We have fought with our neighbours these last few years. Called the other side (people who vote differently from us) idiots and fools. Persuaded in the righteousness of our own cause. We have all been individual pawns knocking each other off. But there’s only one King in this game, and nobody is trying to topple them. 

I want you to think about the other side for a moment. People different from you. Place yourself in their shoes right now. We’ve had a year of protests and riots and destruction. We’ve all placed the blame on each other. But at the end of the day, our needs are exactly the same. We all just want to be treated with respect. We all want the inherent dignity of being a human fucking being. And all of us have been getting robbed – of our dignity, of our jobs, of our future - by the Barons of Wall Street. We are suffering from opioid crisis in our communities. We have an entire generation of NEETS (not in employment, education, or training) who have been cut-off from the supposed Great American Dream. Even those of us who have jobs – was this the job you actually wanted? Was it the job you actually went to school for? Things are supposed to get better with each generation. And yet it seems like our futures were stolen for us before our lives even began. 

So now you know why WallStreetBets, the Gamestop Short Squeeze, is IMPORTANT. This is a beautiful moment we are witnessing in history. You are in the midst of a true DIGITAL SOCIAL MOVEMENT. No more petitions. No more cancel culture. Real digital action. 

The party establishments won’t do anything. The media has been railing against us this whole time, gaslighting you against your own interests. WE ARE FIGHTING BACK. WE WILL NOT LISTEN. Get your diamond hands on those stocks and never let go! 

If you cannot afford Gamestop shares, then get to:

\*Blackberry (BB) – hedge funds are trying to short sell them right now. 

\*AMC 

\*Nokia (NOK)

\*KOSS

\*Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)

\*this is not financial advice, just the ramblings of a retard. Do as you wish\*

There are dozens of others that you can find on the r/WallStreetBets group. It’s time we build our own hedge fund that works for US. 

And who’s to say that we can’t turn Gamestop or Blackberry or AMC theatres around? Who’s to say it’s a “bad stock”. I like the stock. Hell, I even like the companies! We’re the OWNERS now, we can change how things are done. Have our own Reddit WSB Board of Directors, and appoint u/DeepFuckingValue as all-encompassing CEO/Director/COO/etc. at large. Whatever the hell it is these guys do. 

So, look to your left, and look to your right. Give each other a hug. It’s time we moved on from the bickering and divisiveness that has been plaguing this country. We want the same things. It’s time we get our share. 

We want our future back."

(just putting this out there for everyone as a reminder and as a quick crash course for any new prospective GMEers)

THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT GME FOR THIS WEEK (first week in March):


1. DFV is a beast and we honestly owe a lot to him.
2. We crushed the $100 resistance level out of the park and very well may have established a NEW FLOOR at $117. Finishing above $120 in regular market hours yesterday was HUUUUUGE as it shows a commitment to the witching hour from the masses.
4. According to people who actually commit their lives to understanding trends in the stock market, our NEXT RESISTANCE LEVEL will be at $126. This may be our next potential fight, and as such we need to be prepared to send it into the stratosphere as soon as we see it start to dip at that level.
5. BUY THE MINI DIPS! Waiting for the ‘right’ moment isn’t going to happen on a stock like this. Any dip is going to be quickly corrected and if you wana make the most out of things it’s in your best interest to pump it up as soon as you see negative movement - whether you have stock in GME already or not.
6. The more people that buy more and hold, the better chance we have of getting ourself triple digit+ gains. This means that NO ONE SHOULD SELL TODAY. This is not your typical stock. There is a mission behind this onslaught, and you better understand it. This only works if everyone gets on board and stays on board. 
7. There are PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS on the masses whenever we fuel the jet. Whenever a true stock rocket is taking off, everyone and their mother hops on. That’s how this works. When someone sees a sure way to make money for free, they do it. It’s that simple. And it makes sense. Thus, whenever we see a rocket, the more and more we pump it up —> the more people jump on —> the higher the resistance level we create. Pretty numbers like 150 and 200 are both extremely exciting and terrifying to people. People will doubt those numbers are reachable, but once those barriers are hit there is some involuntary reflex that says “fuck it” and more people hop on and FOMO their tits to Valhalla. While this may typically be a less than stellar idea in normal circumstances, it is the best thing that could happen right now. And make no mistake, IT WILL HAPPEN in the curious case of GME.
8. The amount of options in place at 150, 200, and 800 is truly RIDICULOUS. The likelihood of this thing rocketing to a realm where the gains legitimately changes peoples’ lives, their children’s lives, and their grandchildren’s lives for the better is not just a pipe dream.
9. This is not going to come without it’s trials and tribulations. The stock market has ebbs and flows, even with an atypical situation like this. PAPER HANDS ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY. Don’t get fooled by market manipulation or a slight dip. This thing is going up whether you think it is or not. You can either be a part of history and change your economic sustainability or watch from the sidelines as others have the courage to change their lives forever. DIAMOND HANDS WILL SET YOU FREE.

243,"here is a frequent scenario:   

--you're waiting in your car for the next ride request.  
sometimes as long as 10 or 20 minutes during a slower period (100% not paid by lyft)  

--you take the request and drive to the passenger pick up location, up to 15 mins away (also, 100% not paid)  

--the passenger is not ready, they take up to 5 mins to get into the car. (100% not paid, EVEN THOUGH LYFT CLAIMS YOU ARE PAID FOR WAIT TIME, YOU ARE NOT)

--its a short ride, it only takes 5 minutes to get to their destination.   

lyft pays the absolute minimum for this ride (in los angeles) its $2.36

**you just spent** 20+15+5+5 = **45 minutes and got paid $2.36**   

this is before expenses like gas, upkeep, or income tax as an ""independent contractor""   
you have no employee benefits like healthcare or 401k etc.    
no job security.  
no possibility of a raise.  
no possibility of advancement.  
no training for advancement.  

in addition to this, any time lyft claims there is ""surge pricing"" as a multiplier for how much you get paid.  
THEY JUST DONT PAY IT.  

when you look at the ride breakdown of how much you get paid versus how much lyft stole from you, you notice **LYFT TAKES UP TO 70% of the money**  
and they're not doing anything.  
you are the driver, you do 100% of the work.   

lyft takes its ""ride set up fee"" from every single ride, they got their cut, but NO, thats not enough.  
they take 30 to 70% of your ""PER MINUTE"" and ""PER MILE"" ON TOP of the ""ride set up fee""

its a scam. dont do it."

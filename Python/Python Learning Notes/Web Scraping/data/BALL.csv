1,"THEYRE FUCKING IDIOTS. We aren’t like the previous generations, most of us are financially literate and most of us know they do not teach us financial literacy in school. 

So we taught ourselves. We taught each other. 

I was a late in life baby and my parents had me close to retirement (M: 43 / F: 55). I got the pleasure to watch my mother and father struggle most of my life. Especially during the 2008 crisis. my dad spent his entire life tobacco farming and throwing money into the stock market. He lived well-to-ok for the first 70 years of his life only to sell the farm he grew up on in 2010 and now lives off of a social security check and worked until COVID. My mother is a retired teacher and receives a small pension but still has to work. 

BECAUSE THESE WALLSTREET FUCKS SHORTED THE HOUSING MARKET
THE OTHER WALLSTREET FUCKS AT BLACKSTONE PISSED AWAY MY FATHERS RETIREMENT
AND THE ASSHOLES WHO OVERSEE MY MOTHER’S TEACHERS PENSION SOMEHOW COULDNT GENERATE MORE THAN $2,300 A MONTH EVEN THOUGH SHE PAID INTO FOR OVER F-O-R-T-Y FUCKING YEARS 

There is no time to die. We aren’t fucking leavin’. The show goes on. It’s gonna take a fucking WRECKING BALL to take us out"

But... please explain to someone who makes 40-60k a year (or 18k a year at wendy's) how companies that are worth Billions of dollars, (let's assume 40billion for Melvin capital \[Idk, someone floated some big ass number, but let's just stick with this for now, or approximately 1 million years worth of human labor @ 40k a year, or roughly 18,181 Avg Human Working Lifetimes, doesn't have enough fucking money.  And that's just 1 Company.  There's something inherently wrong with a system that allows such a stupid concentration of wealth in such few hands. Why should we/they care?  they screwed us in  the 1920's, they screwed us in 2008, and countless times in between, and then we had to bail them out.  Imagine having to turn around and pay for your terribly unwanted sexy time session that you didn't ask for.

Fuck these guys.  Fuck Melvin.  Fuck Enron, Citron, Citadel and every other A/B/C shitshow that is screwing people over.

Get your money ladies & gents.

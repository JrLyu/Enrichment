0,">If i borrow a stock from you to short, and when I short it and your buddy buys it, then they can loan it to someone else to short

I finally get it now:

* A loans 1 share to B
* B short sells it to C
* C then loans the share out to D
* D also short sells it

Even though only 1 share is involved the short interest is now 2 because D owes C 1 share, and B owes A 1 share. D could buy and close the short with C, now C has a share that B could buy and close with A and the whole thing is unwound.

Only problem is D sold the share to WSB... and WE AREN'T SELLING!!! 💎🙌"
1,"Party A has 4 shares at $10 

Party B [hedge funds in this case] thinks the share price will drop to $5 so they borrow those 4 shares from Party A and sell them to Party C at $10 per share ($40 total), hoping they will be able to buy back those 4 shares when the price goes down to $5. This would give them a 50% profit because ($40 selling gain - $20 of shares bought back and returned to Party A) 

Party C is now in possession of 4 shares 

Party D also thinks the share price will drop to $5 so they borrow the 4 shares from Party C and also sell those 4 shares to party E for $10 each (same situation as A and B are in) 

So now we have 8 shares that have been sold in total out of the 4 actual existing shares. This represents a short interest of 200%. 

Party D now has to buy back 4 shares from Party E in order to give them back to party C. Once that's done, Party B can buy 4 shares from Party C to give back to party A so that the whole thing can be unwound. 

BUT - if party E finds out about all this and holds the stock then party D can't pay back party C , and party B can't pay back Party A. 

Once we reach a certain point in time, party A and party C are both owed their shares back from B and D respectively. But because E is hanging on to those shares they can't return those shares. The only way to return them is to buy more shares, which will either be WAY higher price by now resulting in unfathomable losses, or be unavailable to buy entirely which if I understand correctly would skyrocket the stock price because there is not enough supply.  

This is my understanding. Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm just a dumb fucking retard on the internet who doesn't know shit about fuck"
2,"Lol no not at all dude. Younger people are just as gullible. Have you seen the bullshit being posted in this sub that people blindly trust? Someone was saying Cohen and the C suite not selling meant they knew something was going to happen and the price was worth 300+. Clearly wasn't aware the board and C suite cannot sell shares outside the trading window.  Dumbest shit I've ever seen and people here just ate it all up.  

sincerely, someone who's not selling."
3,"08 definitely sucked. I was 27 and managing a small architectural metals fabrication company in Miami for an absentee owner.  We had a Lehman funded project in Antigua and ob the day Lehman fell, they threw everyone off the jobsite and locked the gates; my foreman called and asked what to do - I told him to jave the guys hoo the fence overnight and ""steal"" their tools back. Owner decided not to pay our shop crew their promised Christmas bonus, so I sold all our stainless scrap and gave them small cash bonuses.

I had to be the axeman that let all the staff go, then it was me too - had to move my wife and young son back to California and move in with my parents. Totally sucked. Meanwhile, the big bank C-suite dickheads pleaded for help and got bailed out, then proceeded to get multi-million dollar ""retention"" bonuses because, even though they ran the country into the ground with their wreckless greed, they were too valuable to lose as they were ""necessary"" to guide their ""too big to fail"" banks through the recession.

Fuck those guys then and fuck them now. Same shit, different day. I'm glad to be a part of this. GameStop is going to be an amazing turnaround story. Wall Street just wants to take, take, take"

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

The best plan they could come up with to avoid total bancrupcy for Wall Street.

10,"Hello fellow traders,

Like you, I am completely disgusted by the actions Robinhood and others have taken to manipulate the market. In response, I have written this letter that you may use to send to your respective Attorney General of the state you live along with any congressmember and state representative. I have removed my state and put in XXX where you can fill in your respective state and you may also fill in your attorney general's name at the top. 

These actions set dangerous precedents that could allow for these companies to do this in the future if their reckless shorting results in them incurring losses. We cannot allow this to happen on our watch or on our dime. 

I have never seen so much community from one subreddit that I've seen here. I have seen countless stories about how this subreddit has helped people pay off their college debt, donate to countless Charites and help their family. We can no longer allow large multibillion dollar hedge funds to bully the little guy. 

It is time to show them that we can fight back... and we will fight back.

&#x200B;

  

Office of the XXX Attorney General

(include their office address as well)

Dear Mister (Or Madam) Attorney General XXX,

I am writing this letter to you today out of concern in response to the drastic steps trading platforms, namely Robinhood Financial LLC, have taken to effectively halt trading on certain company stock and force its sale. This is of great concern because it strikes at the very core of our free and open market because no one person or institution may influence the market. Pursuant to Robinhood’s own disclaimer, under section C it reads in part “I understand that all investments involve risk, that losses may exceed the principal invested, and that the past performance of a security, industry, sector, market, or financial product does not guarantee future results or returns”. I, along with others who use this trading application, agreed, and accepted this condition. It would appear that the hedge funds and other institutional trading instruments refused to heed this warning and engaged in reckless short selling of these companies that Robinhood has now attempted to block. Moreover, their reckless short selling has caused their institutions to lose billions of dollars because of their own greed which brings me to my concern today.

I believe that the halting of trading on these positions of a select few companies effectively manipulates the market and in turn helps these institutional trading companies, mainly Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital, to recover their losses at the expense of XXX investors. In concert with Robinhood, these institutional investment companies have forced XXX investors to cover the immense losses because of their own reckless shorting of GameStop and others by directly giving XXX investors the only option to sell these companies for a loss. As of this writing, Robinhood only allows for the option to close positions on GameStop and others and does not allow for the free market acquisition of more securities of these publicly traded companies.

I ask that your office investigate the alleged connection between Citadel LLC and Melvin Capital with Robinhood Financial LLC and their alleged collusion and subsequent market manipulation. I would ask that the state of XXX joins in with the class action lawsuit that is being filed against Robinhood Financial LLC currently in the works. 

Our free market system hinges on the ability for all citizens to engage in the sale and acquisition of securities at their own risk. The actions of a few large financial corporations do not have the authority to manipulate the market to cover their own recklessness. If nothing is done in response to this, I fear that these trading institutions will be able to, at will, hedge their risk with the knowledge that they can shut down trading on a current stock if it exceeds their risk tolerance. This idea cuts at the fundamental idea of free market capitalism and is a dangerous precedent if nothing is done to address these concerns. 

Thank you for your consideration on this matter."

14,"Pro-tip. Never bet on a ""partnership"" unless there is an actual financial investment or joint venture announced along with.

I used to be a corporate strategy lead for a major data company and its common to have a ""partner"" meeting where the whole purpose is a brainstorming session that leads to a non-specific press release on a partnership opportunity.

Idea of it is that you are ""putting a stake in the ground"" and generating momentum to excite your C-level execs but in reality its a cheap way for some company VP to get some shine and AWS uses it as a way to get in the door for a cloud sales pitch."
15,"This is how this ends this upcoming week: theres been a lot of buying of short term dated call options on stocks all over the market. There was a lot of unusual options activity the past few days. So what does this mean? While retail has been selling their value stocks to chase a meme fomoing in, algorithms follow that price action & drive the market down to get people to bleed. Notice how GME was up during that entire downturn? Then as the market started recovering a bit GME started a downturn (ladder attack) and they made a killing forcing people to sell their calls through robinhood at some really low prices relative to where they were at open. I am of the belief that other stocks will start to rip this next week & people will fomo into those while GME slowly bleeds throughout the week from a high open. They’re going to propel the market up after accumulating a bunch of paper hand value stocks & options, and then as GME dies down, people are going to have to chase that runaway train that is the market ripping. And when they’ve bought back in high, they’ll get crushed back down again and the house will win. They’re going to keep manipulating the stock. Just my two cents. I’m seeing stuff right now that I only saw at the zealous height of B T C ( 💩c0in) and the “H O D L” mentality. I’m pro GME, but the amount of super bullish unusual options activity on stocks market wide I saw this week leads me to believe this next act will be one of the wilder ones."

Also they have refused to send me a copy of my bill from one month in fall that I needed to claim on my work expenses.  It did not populate online, even though I paid it, and a paper one was not sent out to me, and no matter how many times I explain to them that I need a copy of that bill, it takes multiple attempts to get them to understand that I want the bill to look at, and then some other department promises to email a copy within *seven business days* because apparently that's how long emails take to get to you.

21,"> AMC is a good option for people that missed the boat on GME. Most of you that are actually going to make money on GME got in when the price was in single or double digits. That’s where AMC is right now

Exactly. I have one share of GME but I can't really afford to buy more at this price considering the risk. I missed getting in early. AMC, however, is still at a completely reasonable price (undervalued IMO) and has a lot of room to run, especially considering A. Massive short volume B. Theaters set to re-open and get post-COVID boom later in the year and C. The company being in a much better position financially thanks to this run. It may not be the perfect storm of GME, but it still has massive potential and it's another opportunity to fuck the hedge funds"

Edit: my post is back up! Thank you mods and thank you guys for bringing awareness! I'm still shadow banned though I am unable to submit new posts or comments on this subreddit 😢  
  
MODS please don't delete! This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got deleted, if this one does too, spread the word.  
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but Robinhood who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when Robinhood's order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME can still be squoze for all the aforementioned reasons above. Thank you for taking your time to read my DD, please mods do not delete."
23,"I submitted this as a “help with a federal agency” inquiry on whitehouse.gov

https://www.whitehouse.gov/contact/

I had to trim it down so it fit in the character limit. Im thinking that if they get thousands of submissions MAYBE they will look into it. Here is the trimmed version:

Dear SEC and President Biden, I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly... To effect... a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange... or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement... raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others."" Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity: https://preview.redd.it/nmiqx27md4e61.jpg?width=1170&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f3e61c081b3332670eaa8b972c309c6d56177e33 Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government. Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in violation... shall be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price which was affected by such act or transaction."" The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest. Sincerely, Your Average Retail Investor"

Dear President Biden,

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States.

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member of a national securities exchange -- (2) To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, a series of transactions in any security registered on a national securities exchange, any security not so registered, or in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such security, or raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. § 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades) and [https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj](https://imgur.com/gallery/Y9TVxCj) Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S.

Sincerely,

41,"I've read 1-2 papers on clearing so maybe I'm all wrong.  But here goes. tldr: if the seller does an FTD (failure to deliver), the buyer receives an FTR (a failure to receive). An FTR is a coupon that looks exactly like a share and sorta acts like one.

\---

D+0: Bob the Buyer buys 100 shares XYZ at $20 per share. Sam the Seller sells 100 shares XYZ at $20 per share. An exchange matches them up. They have a deal.

D+1: Bob's broker delivers $2000 cash to NSCC (a subsidiary of DTCC). Sam's broker delivers 100 shares XYZ to NSCC.

D+2: NSCC delivers 100 shares XYZ to Bob's broker. Bob's broker puts the shares in Bob's account. NSCC delivers $2000 cash to Sam's broker. Sam's broker puts the shares in Sam's account.

\---

Now, suppose Sam is a sneaky snake and does not deliver the shares. Maybe Sam is a short seller but failed to borrowed the shares. Maybe Sam is a naked short seller and never even tried. to borrow the shares

That's called Failure to Deliver (FTD). One of several things happens.

Alternative A: Sam's broker finds 100 shares XYX somehow and delivers them to NSCC and we're back on track. Sam's broker now has a beef with Sam.

Alternative B: Sam's broker does an FTD. NSCC finds the shares of XYZ somehow and delivers those shares to Bob's broker.  NSCC now has a beef with Sam's broker (and Sam's broker has a beef with Sam).

Altnerative C: Sam's broker does an FTD. NSCC doesn't find the shares. Get this! NSCC creates a coupon called a ""fail to receive"" and transfers that coupon to Bob's broker. Bob's broker puts the FTR coupon in Bob's account. The FTR coupon looks and acts a lot like 100 shares of XYZ. Bob doesn't even know his stock is just an ersatz FTR.

Bob can trade like XYZ, Bob can collect dividends (someone is on the hook for those dividends). However Bob cannot vote the FTR, and Bob cannot hypothecate the FTR for margin credit. Bob probably can't order a physical certificate either (if it's a stock that has physical certificate). 

In Alternative C, NSCC will work to quietly replace the FTR with real stock as time goes by.

\---

As I understand it, this system works okay when there's accidents, like when Bob's broker and Sam's broker report two different versions of what the trade actually does. Or when there's occasional FTD. But again, in my understanding, naked short sellers figured out that they can abuse the system by placing sell orders and then intentionally FTD.

\---

Whew. That's the retard version. Now what I want is someone from AOC's office, and someone else from Ted Cruz's office, who really actually knows this stuff, to drop by the SEC, pick up the full non-redacted versions of these records (with the names of sellers who FTD'd hundreds of thousands of GME shares), and then write some laws with some teeth so that sellers cut down on the so-called ""strategic FTD"". And as long as I'm fapping about this, I'll also fantasize that the media write some honest explainers about this stuff. Bloomberg and CNBC should have some analyst reporters who can do better than one broken down old fart on WSB."

They balance the books and their numbers inform strategy and spending -- but the decisions are made by C-suite execs.

I told them I would commit to staying two more years with the company for a title bump and no raise, which they denied. 

I informed them I would be quitting and within a few weeks I was fired for bullshit. Senior management (C-level executives) didn't think I was worth it. 

Within a month I was hired in at a much larger company, got about a 40% raise, PLUS the title bump I wanted. It took my former company (1) year to find someone to fill my position and they are still trying to figure out what all my programs did. All in their decision probably set back their goals by (2) years. I've since found out that a number of other people also left (I told all of them exactly why I was let go,) and that the C-level executive who didn't think I was worth it is no longer very well respected (for a variety of other reasons.)

Long story short it was very costly to replace me and in my example I wasn't even asking for a raise. In retrospect I probably could have gotten a raise but not the title jump. Go figure."

58,"Matt Levine write about this in his latest blog:

“There are 100 shares. A owns 90 of them, B owns 10. A lends her 90 shares to C, who shorts them all to D. Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90—there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”

60,"Naked shorting is a thing. What happens when C shorts shares which he DOESN'T have to D? How about E doing the same to F? See the situation this creates? A possesses 90, B holds 10. C is on the hook for 90 non-existent shares which now belong to D. E also has to account for the 90 shares which now belong to F. Even though only 100 shares exist, there are 280 shares in ownership only balanced by 180 I.O.U.s.

Imagine having to purchase 180 shares when ONLY 100 exist."
61,"I agree with you.  “Ownership” greater than 100% is a natural extension of short selling.  A lends a share to B who sells it to C.  Now A and C both “own” the same share. In a world with only one share, 200% of shares will be reported as owned by brokerages*

But if A calls the share back, B has to buy it back from C at any price.

Yeah, that's basically the thing that's bugging me. I like the democratization of investing, but it's also created a weird situation wherein you have guys like Andy shooting themselves in their collective feet because they don't know any better.

I know they're adults and everything, and I don't *generally* feel badly for people who make dumb/uninformed decisions, but Andy's been my friend for 20 years. It just kinda drove it home for me. People are going to do whatever they're going to do and you can't stop them. Maybe they'll read a warning and listen to it like Andy  did*n't*, but probably not.

I do think it's a net positive that trading has become so simple. It's just sad that there are so many people who saw GME and now AMC/BB as their only way out of nearly-crippling poverty.

67,"The shares aren't really ""not real"". They are real but they have traded hands a lot. Take 4 people

A: Buys a share

B: Shorts a share, borrowing person A's share

C: Buys the share B sold

D: Shorts the share C bought. 

This creates 2 short positions based on 1 share sold. This isn't fake, this is how the market works. At the same time, technically A and C own the same share share, while C technically owns A's share its counted as 2 as well."
68,"That's entirely possible.

It's also extremely slow to unwind without tapping into the free float.

D sells a retail share to cover C's short. C sells share to market. B buys C's share to return to A

The only way that ladder works is if the lenders of shares are also selling them back into the market.

So if you have a lot of short positions to cover which you're paying for, and you need shares and fast, there are two ways to do it:

* Saturate the market with buy orders and cover your ass at any cost

* Manipulate the market

A short can be covered by the purchase of a call. A call covering a short is allowed to be naked according to SEC rules. This is done into perpetuity and one way to create counterfeit shares.

We didn't see the market saturated with buy orders. I'm leaning towards the latter but only time will tell. I think they halted the markets because they saw they didn't have the sellers to exit their shorts like they wanted."
69,"Thanks for the response. Appreciated and agreed about naked shorts with call options to cover (making them technically not naked). I will note though, that if you have person A and C not selling, both B and D have no need to cover. Add to that if they have a long call, brokers see that as neutral and wont force B and D to buy from the float. So you in a way remain stuck by holding."

79,"Yeah, it's ridiculous and screams fraud (although it might not be).

In any event, it's not ""investing"" as the term is normally used.  It's an [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Strategies) fund.  

From what I've read over the years it works like this:  Stock exchanges are now, of course, 100% computers.  The exchanges exist on servers which are located in different areas across the country.  

When you put in a buy/sell order, your broker will relay this order to the various servers.  What Renaissance does is, it has top-of-the-line direct internet connections to the various servers.  So it will, say, see you want to buy some stock on Server A.  It then goes and buys that stock on servers B, C, and D before *your* buy order even gets to those servers over the network.  It then relists it for a small profit-- and sells it to you.

So it's basically a form of frontrunning using network latency.  Virtually risk-less.

Their argument to regulators is that this is providing market liquidity."

D) and for the double whammy of shitty parent lottery my mother never saved for my college like she was supposed to after the divorce and I basically lost out on 20 grand that would have payed like 75% of the loans I have currently and constantly begged me to borrow money(learned my lesson with dear old dad).

At least I could trust my grandparents with their name on my checking account and my taxes. there were a couple times gram wanted to see the statements because she didn’t like some things(I think it was over MTG cards and I wasn’t even spending that much on them) I was spending my money on by I basically told her to fuck off she wasn’t the one working and putting money into it and my decision was accepted and she never asked again. Still got my own account when I moved out though after college."
82,"I’m not them, but password manager software literally generates random strings for your password (you can set length and complexity) and saves them. The manager is opened with a master password, like a master key for a lock. When you need to use the passwords in the manager, you can either use the password manager and C&P or drag and drop or w/e, or just keep the passwords saved in browser (some managers have browser extensions). I use one that has a mobile app, as well. It’s quite a handy thing and better than making all your passwords variations on “umbrella” or something."
83,And C they don't have to move it out
84,"I literally can't even search $AMC on RH right now. Searching $AM is fine but as soon as I add a C I come up with an ""unexpected error"""
85,I have a friend who bought a new Mercedes C class for like 45-55k. He got  7 year loan with a 600$ payment. He justifys it by using to drive Uber every other weekend to pay for it. I really think he's going to get 4 years into this plan and have like 100k miles on his car.
86,"His first mistake was buying a \~50k C class. You can get a well-equipped one for 40k. The only way to hit 50k+ in a C class is to get an AMG or option everything you can click; including carbon trim pieces, painted pieces, wheels, grills, etc."
87,"I bought a 1999 Corolla for $400 and freaking love it. It has all sorts of quirks but the A/C blows cold and the engine runs strong, and it has a relatively new clutch in it (oh yeah, it's a manual too). I work in a well-paid profession and some of the guys at work drive absurdly expensive vehicles. I saw an Aston Martin in the parking lot last Friday. Anyway my point is that if people looked at depreciation as a check they had to write each year, they'd make different choices when buying cars I think."
88,"MSRP on a 2020 C class is $41K, C43 AMG starts around $52K~"
89,"Oh, I'm very aware the 58 cents/mile covers more than gas- I've worked as both a tax preparer, and an independently contracting ""courier"" filing Schedule C's

&#x200B;

> New tires? 750$/80k miles

$750 / 80k miles = 0.94 cents/mile

> Oil change? 40-90$/5k miles 

$50 / 5k miles = 1.0 cents/mile

&#x200B;

My gas cost is $3.50/gal @ 26mpg = 13.5 cents/mile

So, adding in tires and oil changes makes it 15.44 cents/mile, leaving plenty of room to get to my 20 cents a mile estimate (another *$3,648/80k miles to get to 20 cents/mile*, or, more amazingly, *another $34,048/80k miles to get to 58 cents/mile*)"
90,"No one pays MSRP, you can easily get 5-8k off a C class just for walking in the door.

&#x200B;

>C43 AMG starts around $52K\~

I already said AMG. But I doubt he is ubering in his AMG."
91,"FYI, C corps and S corps will be the same with respect to paying yourself and paying payroll taxes.

C corps have double taxation which require more bookkeeping, and doesn't really provide any benefit for a single person corporation. There's a reason 2/3 of small businesses are S corps."
92,"Yeah, safety is huge for me. I don't care if I save $10k off the price of my vehicle if the trade-off is increased risk of harm in an accident. I can always make more money, but I can't restore years to a crash-shortened life.

Edit: [This really says it all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6V6mtTOIgfU&t=11s). That's a 1997 Mercedes C-class vs a 2014 Mercedes C-class. You can look up other comparisons as well, they're all pretty telling."
93,"Yep. Fuck taxi businesses and fuck taxi drivers. As someone who's traveled a lot, the amount of bullshit they pull is unreal. Lying about distance, lying about bus times, lying about safety of other means of getting somewhere, changing the cost after the trip, not running the meter, hiding the meter, running the meter up intentionally by taking a longer route, pretending they don't have change and therefore you should just pay the difference, rejecting rides because of destination, upcharging tourists for a trip that locals have said has a standard price. Literally I've experienced each and every one of these personally, and this as someone who takes cabs as a last resort. F-U-C-K T-A-X-I-S."
94,Big C has brought me mighty profits before. I'll follow that shiny head through the dark. 
95,"The corporate tax cuts are for a C-Corp, the suggesting here is about an S-Corp. "
96,"We don't know what OP actually does, but there may be some serious liability issues that would make it advantageous for a C-Corp. It's easier to pierce the veil of an S-Corp.

With Occupational Health and Safety, I can see liability being a huge issue."

The Division concludes that the benefits to regulatory and public uses of information from Real-Time Short Position Reporting are likely to be modest. In particular, the Division believes that Real-Time Short Position Reporting and Transaction Marking would provide regulators with little additional information than would already be available from the CAT. However, the Division concludes that the implementation and compliance costs, which could include updating or building a system to collect short position reports, are likely to be significant, even if the information is provided to regulators only. Implementing the CAT will enable the Commission to reassess the extent of any additional benefits that may be derived from requiring Real-Time Short Position Reporting and Transaction Marking, and the costs of any additional infrastructure needed to collect such information. Finally, the Division concludes that a voluntary pilot in Transaction Marking is unlikely to be of much utility. While this report concludes that the short sale reporting regimes studied are unlikely to be cost-effective, the analysis contained in this report should still provide valuable insight to potential future rulemaking regarding short sale disclosure.

1,"As an actuary (person who analyzes insurance claims, prices/designs insurance plans), if you feel like your insurer is trying to take advantage in any way you can either file a grievance+appeal with the insurer which are taken seriously, or file with your states insurance commissioner, also taken seriously. These are not limited to Aetna.   

I can assure you that fucking a customer over is not a factor in goal when decreasing a plans benefits, or the decision in the denial of a claim, or when the insured(you) is  charged too much. There are many checks to ensure that the right procedures are done to the right people. Would monthly MRIs/CAT scans/other visits increase the health of the population? Sure, but is that financially reasonable or necessary? No.  

Procedures are put in place to give the right things to the right people. Sometimes forms are submitted incorrectly which cause something to be denied or processed wrong, there is not optimal communication between doctors and insurers. Sometimes the claims computer just fucks up. It's not as simple as it would seem, but it can be resolved. Follow up with the appropriate channels. "

0,"Congrats on that, glad other are sharing in the gains right now. This last week has been pretty incredible for me as well. Got up to 10k because of etc (yeah I know it's a shitcoin) but reinvested it into ctsi at the bottom when it hit CB and feel incredibly lucky right now. I actually just wanted to hodl ctsi initially, because the speculation it's a great coin with a ton of room to grow, people said $2 by august, yet here we are at like 1.50, and I've already doubled my money again lol. Guess I kind of have a goal to make it to 100k by the end of the year. Idk if thats feasible, but it's a goal"
1,"Just a heads up, I've been using CBP for about a week alongside binance us and the difference in Fees felt significant. Personally I decided on trading on Binance, hodling on regular CB or wallet and split my RH cash withdraws 50/50 between the two.

Edit: should note, I'm dumb and do a good amount of swing trading with alts and such - if you're going to have lots of transactions the 0.075 with BNB vs .5 on CBP really adds up"
2,It's garbage by comparison now; wasn't back when it was the first to offer 5% CB when Chase was only 3% CB

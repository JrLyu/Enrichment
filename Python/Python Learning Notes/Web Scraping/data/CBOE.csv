TIL The original word for 'bear' has been lost. People in middle ages were superstitious and thought saying the animal's name would summon it. They called it 'bear' which means 'the brown one' to avoid saying its actual name.

Make sure you comment and upvote because...

If we reach 5,000 comments, everyone gets some mod privileges.

If we reach #1 on r/all, everyone gets full permissions.

Thread will be locked at 23:59 PM Apr. 2nd, so make sure to comment before then!

THE MODDENING 2019
EDIT

You have 15 minutes to accept the invitation or it will be rescinded, as there can be a maximum of 25 pending invites at any one time.

EDIT 2

We have hit the rate limit! https://i.imgur.com/b2gBgcL.png
The moderator invites will resume in 1 hour!

Again, everyone who comments below will be modded eventually

EDIT 3

Currently #400 on r/all...

UPVOTE IF YOU WANT TO SEE THE WORLD BURN
EDIT 4

#250 now... the modpocalypse is nigh...

If we hit #1 on r/all, we continue adding moderators as fast as we can (considering the ratelimit).

Once everyone has been added as a moderator, we will shut down the subreddit and give everyone full permissions. The subreddit will then open to the public on the following business day at 9:00am

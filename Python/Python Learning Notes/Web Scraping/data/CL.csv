You are an *individual investor*

Robinhood Financial LLC is an *Broker-Dealer* (I believe this to be the better answer than Day-trading firm or On-Line Trading Firm)

A common stonk is an *Equity Security (general)*

GME calls would be *Options (Except Stock Index)*

Security symbol: *GME*

NameÂ of IssuerÂ or Security:  *GAMESTOP CORP NEW CL A*"
1,"For the SEC ""Tell Us About Your Complaint"" I put this:

Robinhood Financial LLC has manipulated GAMESTOP CORP NEW CL A stock Ticker symbol: GME. They have done this by prohibiting the ability to buy the stock yet not the ability to sell. This violates Rule 144 of the SEC because it is a manipulation of the stocks Volume. 

Robinhood has ties to hedge funds invested in shorting GME. They sell data to Citadel LLC who has recently bailed out Melvin Capital Management LP who was heavily shorting the stock. This is a conflict of Interest. Please look into how Melvin Capital was able to short GME 140% of the shares outstanding thereby depressing GME's Market Cap below its cash value. Look into the loan by Citadel. Look into Robinhood's ties to Citadel and Melvin capital.

Thank you for your time."
2,"Nice try with the FUD. PhD and this the best you got? FOH. The share numbers don't add up because as [bohoo123er](https://www.reddit.com/user/bohoo123er/) mentioned, you don't account for investors lending shares out. Also, the data you linked to shows each stock's fail to deliver on each day of December. According to the [link](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) you provided, ""Fails to deliver on a given day are a **cumulative** **number** **of all fails outstanding until that day**, plus new fails that occur that day, less fails that settle that day. The figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails. In other words, **these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's aggregate fails.**"" 

Why are you summing each GME line if each value is already an aggregation up until that date? You're giving us a sum of cumulative sums. Even these numbers don't add up:

20201201 GME 91971 GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A 16.56

This is from the first half of December, the total already exceeds your supposed **5,969,693.** Because it's not the right sum.

People, be careful what you read on this sub and be sure to fact check everything and click into those links to verify what they say is accurate. They're trying to spread misinformation on the sub.

All we need to do is BUY and HOLD ðŸ’ŽðŸ™ŒðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"

And a relevant bit of info I found on investopedia:

[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/failuretodeliver.asp)

>During the financial crisis of 2008, failures to deliver increased. Much the same as check kiting, where someone writes a check but has not yet secured the funds to cover it, sellers did not surrender securities sold on time. They delayed the process to buy securities at a lower price for delivery. Regulators still need to address this practice. 

What I can assume is that there was a lot of naked call selling during this time and whoever sold the calls is struggling to buy the actual shares needed to fulfill the call options contract.

So, bullish ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€ðŸš€ ðŸš€ ðŸš€

NOTE: Not financial advise, do you own research and I hold 1 share of GME."
4,"Holy fuck. How can they sell shares they don't have? I read some articles about a guy who bought an ENTIRE company who's stock was at a fraction of a cent for like $5k and even though he owned every single share the market still showed millions of shares of trading activity. 

If this event does anything I hope it brings to light the amount of fraud and bullshit that these funds have gotten away with for fuckin decades. This is way beyond GME, this is a revolution.

Edit: This is the most recent report on the OP's source for shares that failed to deliver. 

>**36467W109|GME|621483|GAMESTOP CORP (HLDG CO) CL A|31.40**
>**20210114**

It's showing 621,483 shares failed to deliver on Jan 14th. I have no doubt this number is in the millions by now."

According to my calcs right at $101M"
6,"My friend had a very tense yelling with his boss. The boss was being an a-hole and docking his annual bonus, blaming him for some snafu that happened while my friend was on vacation. 

Anyways, my friend found the boss personal email and signed him for all sorts of online junk, mostly related to penis enlargement - the junk emails came personalized (first name, last name). He also set-up fake Craigslist postings. The boss started getting random calls of people inquiring about the pleasure toys he's selling. He also created a post on ""male seeking males"" on CL - boss was getting way many dick pics from unknown numbers.

His boss almost went mad. He had to change his phone number and his personal email."
7,We could buy a brand new sofa...but *why*? Got a killer one with a sleeper pull-out on CL for $100. Just got a beautiful stand up easel for $40 at a thrift store. 
8,"Contents sales, estate sales.  Local investment bank hires some hotshot out of Munich, brings him over to Toronto, puts him in a house and furnishes it with high-end stuff, a year later he is transferred to Tel Aviv and the furnishings are sold for pennies on the dollar.  And remember, that guy hardly spent a minute at home and his wife and kids only came to visit that one time, so the furniture is basically new.  Do a little negotiating with the contents sale main guy and you're off to the races.

Also garage sales of course.  Half my nicest pieces are mine because the nice old guy or little old lady trusted my word that I'd use the item as a furnishing in my home, rather than flogging it on CL.  Nothing massively valuable but nice well-kept pieces that my heirs will be happy to receive.  Sure the house is a bit of a hodgepodge design-wise but IDC, it's the kind of house I always hoped I'd live in, filled with neat-o things and comfy chairs"
9,"Mine too. I loooove Craigslist. All of our best furniture is from there. Stuff we never could have afforded otherwise.  I love furniture design and you have to wade through a lot of junk, but there are real treasures on CL."
10,Craigslist is the best for furniture! I'll spend $200 on something secondhand on CL before I even step foot into Target or IKEA to spend $200 on particle board. I got my solid wood dresser for $75 from an older couple and my futon for free from a rich area because they just wanted it gone.
11,"Hand-me-downs are even better than thrift store/CL finds. They're usually free, you know where they came from, & family (hopefully) won't give you something with bugs in it. 

My grandmother moved from FL to live with my mom & gave us loads of furniture for our new house. Two power-recline chairs she paid something like 2k/per chair.... That's more than we've spent on all our other furniture combined! It's not stuff I'd spend my money on, but it's nice having quality stuff like that mixed in with everything else. "
12,"Gotta be dedicated where I live. I rarely see anything but garbage in thrift stores, anything decent on CL is really overpriced or gone immediately. Consignment is hit and miss but a lot of them are super expensive."
13,"uh why not? I have two fantastic, comfy, amazing couches I got both on CL for $50 each. They're better than the $3000+ couches my girlfriend's family has."
14,"I think the problem with Craigslist (not my problem, everyone else's!) is that so many people assume that every CL transaction ends with you getting brutally murdered.  At least this is what happens in my life.  I assure people though that Craigslist is full of people who have something to sell who are looking for someone to purchase it.  End of story."
15,"Sooo.... We were moving, and we had a festive night out before moving day. I passed out on the couch, and someone may have peed my pants. A lot. Still never found out who.    
    
Anyway, it was a nice couch, though cloth, and I didn't want to have it cleaned to move it. It was typhoon wet in the middle cushion and backing. So I put it on CL. I said my friends child slept on it and peed it up (The shame was too great). I said that on the ad, full disclosure. Although I didn't say it was full grown man-pee, pee was definitely involved. It needed to be cleaned.    
    
I listed it for a silly price (like $20 because I thought 'free' would take longer than crazy low price). The people that came 2 hours after I listed it asked about the pee area. The lady pointed to the pee ""zone"", then (*shutter*), pushed her spread hand into it until it did that weird wet phhhshhhuuuk moist compression noise. She raised her now moist hand and said ""Ain't that bad!"", then put said glistening hand in her purse and grabbed me $20. She never asked to use my sink. Loaded up the couch and off they went.    
    
I don't know how this is relevant. But that CL lady touched my pee."
16,"Agreed. Not to burst anyones bubble or anything but bed bugs don't really care about socioeconomic status. People travel for work, school, etc. So, if they are unlucky enough to come in contact with a person who just so happens to have bed bugs--well, let me tell you, the nice neighborhood won't protect them or their things they want to sell to you. 

If you've been lucky enough to avoid bed bugs or any other ""fun"" items on your CL bargain hunts I say wonderful and I hope your luck continues. 
However, all it takes is ONE item that can't be washed and/or steamed down or treated that can turn your home into a living hell. 

I have a friend who purchased a lovely dining set from none other than an, ESTATE SALE in a lovely area, turns out that the wood had some guests attached. ""woods?"" Roach eggs. (I dunno specifically what type, but for story purposes assume they are just the fancy kind that like to hang out in wooded rich areas). Lovely right? 

Another friend of mine purchased a lovely solid bed frame and set another CL 'need to move out by xyz date for closing/everything must go estate sale etc etc.' The set was absolutely gorgeous probably over 15k originally--it brought with it bed bugs. She spent over $6,500 to get rid of them and had to throw out her kids toys and other items that couldn't be washed. It was a nightmare and totally not worth the risk.

Bottom line, I refuse to purchase ANY furniture from CL unless it's wrought iron and I'm tossing it outside. Just because a home looks clean, you can never really tell what the item you are bring home is carrying with it and unfortunately people who know they have bug problems aren't going to tell you ahead of time or maybe they genuinely don't even know (some folks don't react to bed bug bites at all). 

My solution? I shop the furniture outlets and wait for deep discounted sales. I purchased an entire sectional from the Raymore and Flanagan Outlet for $499. I also purchased a king size solid wooden frame for $199. My mom hunted at the Macy's furniture outlets and when they are clearing inventory from their warehouses they practically give the furniture away! She purchased three three-person sofa's for 400 bucks. 

I do agree that it takes time to build a home. But I say it's safer to save, wait, and stock it with newer items when they become available at a price your willing to pay at a furniture outlet. The alternative could be spending thousands you don't have on emergency pest control last minute & putting yourself and/or your family at risk. 

Not worth the, 'bargain.' At least that's my opinion. 

*Edit: 
Just some light reading on how pervasive these little buggers can be in any neighborhood. 

Take a look at this article from the, *NYMag*. 

An oldie but a goodie: http://nymag.com/news/features/65733/

Notice how complete anonymity was required to print the story and exterminators were required to sign non disclosure forms... crazy right? 

I'm getting itchy just thinking about all this! Ugh. "
17,"I bought a mattress, box spring, storage bed frame, two bedside tables, and two lamps (with bulbs! lol) on Craigslist all for only $250. This was an incredible steal. Everything was from IKEA and basically what I wanted to purchase anyway (I was only looking for the bed). In fact, I was already at IKEA when I got the email reply about the sale. Everything was practically new. The mattress could not have been older than two years and it was clear that it had barely been used. They said it was in the guest room. I took a chance on bed bugs, etc, but when I got to that apartment, I saw it was in a swank building and extremely clean and neat. I really was not worried at all. The sellers were pretty awesome people as well. 

So, you can totally find great ""soft"" items on CL. Just wanted to share my experience because I'm still in awe how much of a deal I got. These people just wanted to move from a two bedroom down to a one bedroom in the same building. 

This was in NYC metro area btw. "
18,"Your last sentence seems sincere. Those are two grade A reasons for using CL. Preferably not in the same transection, but I wouldn't judge."
19,"Look at the condition of the home it is in. If it's a really clean place in a really clean building, that's a good sign. 

Also, ask why they are selling it. If it's because they are moving, that is also a good sign. Also, look at the beginning of the month, because this is when people move into new places and either there is too much furniture between roommates or certain pieces don't fit.

As so many others have already said, besides mattresses, CL and estate/garage sales can be real treasures. Especially if it is solid wood furniture."

0,"Lots of good info here- would note however that the minimum to open cost of $2500 is not required (Fidelity). Neither the CMA nor the brokerage acct require that initial minimum to open or maintain the account. It states this on the account application to prevent confusion after the fact, coinciding with the $2500 initial mutual fund investment you mentioned. 

I would also be interested in hearing how, in regards to the section beginning ""Also, though both Fidelity and Schwab..."" regarding trade commissions, expense ratios, etc result in Schwab being ""the clear winner"". There's a lot to that statement, and nothing that really shows a definitive answer that Schwab wins out there. Far too many different expense ratios and fee structures across each companies multiple products to have a ""clear winner"", as there are many products that are neither proprietary to that specific company, as well as products with expenses at both ends of the spectrum for both."

We met EPS expectations.

We had 171% growth in eCommerce.

We had better margins and SG&A

We have a new COO, Jenna Owens, director  level roles in the past around digital transformation at fucking Google, McKinsey, and Amazon.

We have a much deeper emphasis on digitisation strategy, fat loss.

We paid down $57m of debt.

We shot up 8% in AH as a result but all some folks are screaming about in here is that AH is now only +5%?

9,"Sadly, we are up against THE most powerful, most politically connected, wealthiest, dirtiest, most cutthroat, group of sociopaths you NEVER want to meet. That is why they hold the positions of power that they do. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm NOT saying it‚Äôs impossible to beat these Mother fuckers because it IS possible. However, I assure you, they do not loose often because the system is rigged in their favor and they play knowing THEY ARE THE HOUSE. Ask yourself, when is the last time a CEO, CFO, COO, or a Board member of a major bank went to jail for stealing millions or even billions from us? Never, because the laws that the Congress write protect them. That‚Äôs right our fucking elected representatives Democrats and Republicans alike write laws to protect these Corporate assholes from being arrested and thrown in jail. Just like the Representatives and Senators write laws that protect themselves. They can lie through their teeth as long as they do it on the Congress and Senate floor they have immunity, BAM! 

The only way to beat them is to beat them at their own game just like we did with $GME except this time we have the fore knowledge that they will try anything and everything to fuck with us. Perhaps this time we go strictly cash, no margin. Yep, I know no moon shot money but they also can‚Äôt fuck with your shares either. Just one suggestion. I‚Äôm sure there are many more options and opportunities to strike back at the evil empire. God Bless and Godspeed."
10,"Ladies and gentlemen, Democrats and Republicans, you‚Äôve been duped

Over the last 10 years, we‚Äôve been told our country is getting increasingly divided. For the last 4 years, we‚Äôve been told that Civil War was around the corner. For the 12 months, we‚Äôve been worried about a pandemic, lockdowns, losing jobs, a divisive election, an insurrection. 

The truth is ‚Äì we‚Äôve been fighting the same enemy this whole time. We just didn‚Äôt know it.

To the liberals here ‚Äì how often have you worried about the gap between the rich and the poor? The 1% vs the 99%? Wages stagnating? Inequality? Environmental destruction from multinational corporations? We were all listening to Green Day not too long ago, railing against the establishment. Are you not a little suspicious of the number of corporations that have suddenly changed their ‚Äúvalues‚Äù to be progressive? Are you not suspicious over Big Tech‚Äôs rush to censor dissent? 

To the conservatives here ‚Äì you have been worried about your jobs being outsourced overseas, about your factories and manufacturing base disappearing, about the destruction of the family unit (particularly in rural communities). You wanted to drain the swamp. You‚Äôve worried over the rise of China and our trade dependence on them. Yet so much of the GOP‚Äôs policies have favoured the corporations who have abandoned you for decades. 

We (the liberal and conservative base) have been worried about the same thing. We‚Äôve been fighting the same foe this whole time. And yet we‚Äôve both allowed the Corporatist Media and Party Establishments to pull the wool over our eyes. We have been so focused on fighting each other for years, blinded by our (skewed) perception that ‚Äúthe other side‚Äù was working with the enemy, we failed to see who was behind us this whole time. Ladies and gentlemen, we are all Gandalf, just realizing now that Saruman is in league with Sauron. 

This is beyond hedge fund predators. This is the 1%. The swamp. Crony capitalists. ‚ÄúThe man‚Äù. Whatever you want to call them. They‚Äôve been making trillions of dollars during this pandemic. They‚Äôve been gambling with your money for decades, causing the near collapse of our economy in 2008. They‚Äôve been milking you dry. They‚Äôve been short-selling and squeezing the life of so many companies, losing millions of jobs, to the point where companies like Sears can‚Äôt even pay the pensions of retirees. Speaking of that - there are no pensions anymore. There is no minimum wage. All wages have been stagnating for decades. Where is your future? They claim the stock market is doing well. The economy is growing. And yet, where are you? Stuck? Still? Do you have a home yet? Are your student loans paid off yet? Will you ever afford to have a family? WHERE IS YOUR FUTURE. 

Jeff Bezos has enough money to pay $50,000 to 4 million people. The 20 wealthiest Americans have $1 TRILLION worth of wealth. That‚Äôs $50,000 for 20 million people. Or $3400 for 300 million Americans. Sure beats the $600 we got! Their world is completely different from yours. Everything in this system is rigged in their favour. We can have a global pandemic, a lockdown, and yet they can be richer now than they‚Äôve ever been. We could have a Civil War (which is what they wanted?) and they could come out of it completely unscathed. Do you know how many billionaire‚Äôs own doomsday bunkers? They don‚Äôt have to go underground. They can take their yachts and travel the world until shit blows over. They can rest easy in their Switzerland-based chalet‚Äôs or their countryside villa‚Äôs in southern France. They don‚Äôt need you. 

We should be ashamed of ourselves. We have fought with our neighbours these last few years. Called the other side (people who vote differently from us) idiots and fools. Persuaded in the righteousness of our own cause. We have all been individual pawns knocking each other off. But there‚Äôs only one King in this game, and nobody is trying to topple them. 

I want you to think about the other side for a moment. People different from you. Place yourself in their shoes right now. We‚Äôve had a year of protests and riots and destruction. We‚Äôve all placed the blame on each other. But at the end of the day, our needs are exactly the same. We all just want to be treated with respect. We all want the inherent dignity of being a human fucking being. And all of us have been getting robbed ‚Äì of our dignity, of our jobs, of our future - by the Barons of Wall Street. We are suffering from opioid crisis in our communities. We have an entire generation of NEETS (not in employment, education, or training) who have been cut-off from the supposed Great American Dream. Even those of us who have jobs ‚Äì was this the job you actually wanted? Was it the job you actually went to school for? Things are supposed to get better with each generation. And yet it seems like our futures were stolen for us before our lives even began. 

So now you know why WallStreetBets, the Gamestop Short Squeeze, is IMPORTANT. This is a beautiful moment we are witnessing in history. You are in the midst of a true DIGITAL SOCIAL MOVEMENT. No more petitions. No more cancel culture. Real digital action. 

The party establishments won‚Äôt do anything. The media has been railing against us this whole time, gaslighting you against your own interests. WE ARE FIGHTING BACK. WE WILL NOT LISTEN. Get your diamond hands on those stocks and never let go! 

If you cannot afford Gamestop shares, then get to:

\*Blackberry (BB) ‚Äì hedge funds are trying to short sell them right now. 

\*AMC 

\*Nokia (NOK)

\*KOSS

\*Bed Bath and Beyond (BBBY)

\*this is not financial advice, just the ramblings of a retard. Do as you wish\*

There are dozens of others that you can find on the r/WallStreetBets group. It‚Äôs time we build our own hedge fund that works for US. 

And who‚Äôs to say that we can‚Äôt turn Gamestop or Blackberry or AMC theatres around? Who‚Äôs to say it‚Äôs a ‚Äúbad stock‚Äù. I like the stock. Hell, I even like the companies! We‚Äôre the OWNERS now, we can change how things are done. Have our own Reddit WSB Board of Directors, and appoint u/DeepFuckingValue as all-encompassing CEO/Director/COO/etc. at large. Whatever the hell it is these guys do. 

So, look to your left, and look to your right. Give each other a hug. It‚Äôs time we moved on from the bickering and divisiveness that has been plaguing this country. We want the same things. It‚Äôs time we get our share. 

We want our future back."

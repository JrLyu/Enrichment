I know that money is probably gonna be lost, but fuck it! 360.000 COP is a small price to pay to contribute to the suffering of those wall street pigs!

If you Americans think they fucked you over! Then imagine how us in the 3rd world were affected, skyrocketing dollar price, TLC deals that fucked our farmers over and festered the cartels, my dad got killed in 2008, my family got into a ton of debt and we almost lost or small company (my dad had made some long term deals that ended up saving us in 2012), I have many reasons to hate those disgusting slimy motherfuckers as well.

And I’ll contribute with what I can (we’re  on financial trouble again because of Covid)"

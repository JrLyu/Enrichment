Robinhood Financial LLC 85 Willow Road Menlo Park, CA 94025 United States

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

Edit: Fellow Regarded, please buy more GME and Hold 💎🤚🏾 the rewards helps with visibility but it’s better spent there.

Edit 2: 
I’m getting a lot of questions regarding the same things so I’ll try my best to answer them. 
- For FINRA online complaint, scroll down to the section reading “Problems addressed by FINRA” under it click the Orange button that reads “FILE ONLINE COMPLAINT” 
- FINRA CRD NUMBER: 165998 [ Thanks u/Mattcwh ]
- User [R] pointed out that Robinhood is owned by Citedal, a hedge fund that along side with Point72 injected ~$3B into Melvin. Standing to lose a shitton of money to us degenerates. This further points out why Robinhood  is trying to manipulate the market to help out the suits at Wall St. 
- Lots of questions concerning the Security type. If it’s for GME you put it under CLASS A OR D Securities.

Edit 3: Thanks for all the people who filed what they could."

2,">If i borrow a stock from you to short, and when I short it and your buddy buys it, then they can loan it to someone else to short

I finally get it now:

* A loans 1 share to B
* B short sells it to C
* C then loans the share out to D
* D also short sells it

Even though only 1 share is involved the short interest is now 2 because D owes C 1 share, and B owes A 1 share. D could buy and close the short with C, now C has a share that B could buy and close with A and the whole thing is unwound.

Only problem is D sold the share to WSB... and WE AREN'T SELLING!!! 💎🙌"
3,"Damn Mark, wasn't expecting this caliber or question or response lol. Edge compute ftw! :D"
4,"Party A has 4 shares at $10 

Party B [hedge funds in this case] thinks the share price will drop to $5 so they borrow those 4 shares from Party A and sell them to Party C at $10 per share ($40 total), hoping they will be able to buy back those 4 shares when the price goes down to $5. This would give them a 50% profit because ($40 selling gain - $20 of shares bought back and returned to Party A) 

Party C is now in possession of 4 shares 

Party D also thinks the share price will drop to $5 so they borrow the 4 shares from Party C and also sell those 4 shares to party E for $10 each (same situation as A and B are in) 

So now we have 8 shares that have been sold in total out of the 4 actual existing shares. This represents a short interest of 200%. 

Party D now has to buy back 4 shares from Party E in order to give them back to party C. Once that's done, Party B can buy 4 shares from Party C to give back to party A so that the whole thing can be unwound. 

BUT - if party E finds out about all this and holds the stock then party D can't pay back party C , and party B can't pay back Party A. 

Once we reach a certain point in time, party A and party C are both owed their shares back from B and D respectively. But because E is hanging on to those shares they can't return those shares. The only way to return them is to buy more shares, which will either be WAY higher price by now resulting in unfathomable losses, or be unavailable to buy entirely which if I understand correctly would skyrocket the stock price because there is not enough supply.  

This is my understanding. Correct me if I'm wrong because I'm just a dumb fucking retard on the internet who doesn't know shit about fuck"

7,"My uneducated guess and probably based on hope is that the process so far has developed as it follows: 

1. The HF shorted GME predicting an inevitable bankruptcy due to COVID19
2. Some educated retards from WSB of the likes of DeepFuckingValue who’ve been studying and daydreaming of this type of situations saw the opportunity and raised awareness. It also happened that GME is a gaming asset with deep emotional ties for a major part of the whole Reddit community. Add to that the support of some VERY well know and respected figures 📷📷📷 which happened to have a lot of hate for HF shorting his business and a huge snowball formed while the HF were hoping for the hype to wear off
3. The hype never wore off and an emergency plan was executed. Maybe the HF had it in their protocols for years, maybe they just had to improvise. Whatever it was they came up with THIS plan: 0) Delay covering the stocks shorted A) Short the stock again at 400$ B) Ask brokers to cut demand while artificially driving down the price of stocks with ladder attacks. C) Ask brokers to force stop losses on assets D) Buy those assets automatically beeing sent back into the system to cover the stocks shorted at 400$

This leads us to tue current situation where:

1. They still have to cover for the stocks shorted at 4$
2. They recovered some of the billions they will lose covering thise shorts by shorting at 400$ and covering at 100$
3. They cleaned the system of all the paper hands eho puechased during the hype.
4. Now there will be comolete and absolute silence as if everything has passed and everything is lost
5. They keep buying back stock at a rate where the market allows for the price to stay steady, buying from those who tyink it is game over.
6. When the final deadline will arrive, they will stomp to buy what’s left to cover.

15,"This is fucking cringe. Seriously.

It’s a fucking stock. There are many others out there that you can make money off of. The stock was going to come down eventually. There can never be a situation where the stock is in a bubble and “everyone wins”. Everyone DOES win when the stock is fairly valued and shareholders’ value grows as the company’s does. But when the stock is in a market bubble with nothing pushing up the value but more people buying in, then it’s bound to sell off at some point. People who bought in are bound to lose. Even without the brokers restricting trades, this sell off was bound to happen. This is basic finance 101. Most of you who bought in were bound to lose your money anyways, just like people who bought the dot com bubble at the top, just like people who bought the VW short squeeze, D***c***, etc. The brokers didn’t want to restrict trades on these stocks - they were made to by their clearing houses because the clearing houses didn’t want to be on the hook for when most of you tards became insolvent. They simply were not equipped for the market entering this level of volatility.

OG WSB would never have garbage like this getting upvoted to the front page. Your money is your money. The only person who matters in the market is you: you’re not “sticking it to the hedge funds” by bankrupting yourself as part of a retarded, futile attempt to drive a stock’s price into a massive market bubble. Make the decision that will most benefit you and your money, not this retarded “movement”."
16,"Person A sells 100 shares so Fund B can cover their short. By covering, Fund B gives those 100 shares to Bank C that lent it to them. Bank C can sell those 100 shares to Fund D who was also short and wants to cover. Fund D now gives those 100 shares to Bank E who lent them the shares. Same 100 shares just used to get 200 shares of shorts covered"

They are in it to make money and the potential ripples it could cause in the system if they start pushing to bankrupt clearing houses is probably not worth it for them. look up the 13-D. some small texas teachers pension fund has 60k shares.

19,"This is how this ends this upcoming week: theres been a lot of buying of short term dated call options on stocks all over the market. There was a lot of unusual options activity the past few days. So what does this mean? While retail has been selling their value stocks to chase a meme fomoing in, algorithms follow that price action & drive the market down to get people to bleed. Notice how GME was up during that entire downturn? Then as the market started recovering a bit GME started a downturn (ladder attack) and they made a killing forcing people to sell their calls through robinhood at some really low prices relative to where they were at open. I am of the belief that other stocks will start to rip this next week & people will fomo into those while GME slowly bleeds throughout the week from a high open. They’re going to propel the market up after accumulating a bunch of paper hand value stocks & options, and then as GME dies down, people are going to have to chase that runaway train that is the market ripping. And when they’ve bought back in high, they’ll get crushed back down again and the house will win. They’re going to keep manipulating the stock. Just my two cents. I’m seeing stuff right now that I only saw at the zealous height of B T C ( 💩c0in) and the “H O D L” mentality. I’m pro GME, but the amount of super bullish unusual options activity on stocks market wide I saw this week leads me to believe this next act will be one of the wilder ones."

The STOCK act was passed to combat the insider trading in congress, as a [direct response to a 60 minutes report that explicitly mentions](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2011/11/hustle-defuse-60-minutes-congressional-insider-trading-story/335497/) Nancy Pelosi (D) Spencer Bachus (R) [Dick Durbin](https://web.archive.org/web/20080920014104/http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087) (R), and John Boehner (R) in relations to trades they made before the 2008 housing collapse. For what its worth, Boehner Durbin and Bachus look far worse in this specific scenario, but regardless

putting us at D(1) and R(3).

this was left an unshaken pot [as far as i can see](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insider_trading#By_members_of_Congress), until [2020 of course where we had a new scandal related to covid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal). In that senators David Perdue (R), Kelly Loeffler (R), John Hoeven (R), Richard Burr (R), Jim Inhofe (R) and Dianne Feinstein (D) were all implicated in this insider trading. as well as Greg Gianforte(R), a governor but candidate at the time.

Giving us a total tally of 

**D(2) and R(9)**. 

Which, I would personally consider statistically relevant."
36,"> Which, I would personally consider statistically relevant.

Fortunately we have actual math to tell is whether or not this is truly statistically relevant.

So given 11 insider trading senators, how significant is it that 9 of these 11 are republican?

If we assume the senate is about 50/50 D/R (close enough, even if it leaned 60/40 in either direction the numbers would basically be the same). We'll say there are 50 Ds and 50 Rs.

Pulling 11 Ss from this pool completely randomly yields a 3.27% chance of 9 of them being R.

A sample size of 11 (out of 100) gives us a confidence level of 70% and a margin of error of 15% [source](https://www.calculator.net/sample-size-calculator.html?type=1&cl=70&ci=15&pp=50&ps=100&x=45&y=2).

I do not even need to check the p-table to tell you that this will yield a p-score far above 0.05, thus letting us say this is clearly not statistically significant."
37,"Love it. I think my most delicious non financial case was a girlfriend whose husband literally changed jobs to get on an insurance plan that covered IVF. They did all the research to make sure. They got on the plan and THEN were told that although they cover the actual IVF procedure, they don’t cover the necessary drugs. The drugs are the expensive part.

She posted in grief on FB. She’s always wanted kids and thought she had figured out a way to make it work with her health issues.

I convinced her to file a complaint with her state insurance commissioner, the company immediately not only said they would cover her drugs but to change their whole policy.

65,"Same :)

I don't even have any shares I'm just here for support :D"
66,"I've read 1-2 papers on clearing so maybe I'm all wrong.  But here goes. tldr: if the seller does an FTD (failure to deliver), the buyer receives an FTR (a failure to receive). An FTR is a coupon that looks exactly like a share and sorta acts like one.

\---

D+0: Bob the Buyer buys 100 shares XYZ at $20 per share. Sam the Seller sells 100 shares XYZ at $20 per share. An exchange matches them up. They have a deal.

D+1: Bob's broker delivers $2000 cash to NSCC (a subsidiary of DTCC). Sam's broker delivers 100 shares XYZ to NSCC.

D+2: NSCC delivers 100 shares XYZ to Bob's broker. Bob's broker puts the shares in Bob's account. NSCC delivers $2000 cash to Sam's broker. Sam's broker puts the shares in Sam's account.

\---

Now, suppose Sam is a sneaky snake and does not deliver the shares. Maybe Sam is a short seller but failed to borrowed the shares. Maybe Sam is a naked short seller and never even tried. to borrow the shares

That's called Failure to Deliver (FTD). One of several things happens.

Alternative A: Sam's broker finds 100 shares XYX somehow and delivers them to NSCC and we're back on track. Sam's broker now has a beef with Sam.

Alternative B: Sam's broker does an FTD. NSCC finds the shares of XYZ somehow and delivers those shares to Bob's broker.  NSCC now has a beef with Sam's broker (and Sam's broker has a beef with Sam).

Altnerative C: Sam's broker does an FTD. NSCC doesn't find the shares. Get this! NSCC creates a coupon called a ""fail to receive"" and transfers that coupon to Bob's broker. Bob's broker puts the FTR coupon in Bob's account. The FTR coupon looks and acts a lot like 100 shares of XYZ. Bob doesn't even know his stock is just an ersatz FTR.

Bob can trade like XYZ, Bob can collect dividends (someone is on the hook for those dividends). However Bob cannot vote the FTR, and Bob cannot hypothecate the FTR for margin credit. Bob probably can't order a physical certificate either (if it's a stock that has physical certificate). 

In Alternative C, NSCC will work to quietly replace the FTR with real stock as time goes by.

As I understand it, this system works okay when there's accidents, like when Bob's broker and Sam's broker report two different versions of what the trade actually does. Or when there's occasional FTD. But again, in my understanding, naked short sellers figured out that they can abuse the system by placing sell orders and then intentionally FTD.

\---

Whew. That's the retard version. Now what I want is someone from AOC's office, and someone else from Ted Cruz's office, who really actually knows this stuff, to drop by the SEC, pick up the full non-redacted versions of these records (with the names of sellers who FTD'd hundreds of thousands of GME shares), and then write some laws with some teeth so that sellers cut down on the so-called ""strategic FTD"". And as long as I'm fapping about this, I'll also fantasize that the media write some honest explainers about this stuff. Bloomberg and CNBC should have some analyst reporters who can do better than one broken down old fart on WSB."

81,"Seems oversimplified. I'd agree that replacing an employee has a cost and one should not be shy to use it as a leverage. But few anecdotes from my personal experience:

* Years ago I worked as an intern in a company. We had to deal with warehouse workers. Most of the workers there would leave within 6 months. I asked our financial director, why they did not want to put any effort to retain them, seemed like a waste of resources. But he clearly explained, that even though some training was required, it was still cheaper to replace regularly than retain. First, it was an entry-level position, young folks without experience flocked there. They always had a pool to select few sane candidates. Training would take up to two week, which was called a probation and they were paid peanuts. They salary was low anyhow. They could have fucked up, but it was mitigated by having few permanent supervisors with dictatorial management style, so damage was controlled and predictable. Trying to retain them would require someone's dedicated attention and more money. It did not make sense, because everything worked as expected and it was not a dream job anyway. Good worker would leave soon enough regardless, bad workers weren't worth retaining. **Sometimes high employee attrition rate is a feature, not a bug.**

* My uncle is an accountant. He has been with the same company for a long time. Their accounting is intensive. He manages a team of 5-7. He always complains that it is very hard to find adequate people. He is not even expecting smart or experienced candidates, just sane and trainable. He has to let someone go often. I suggested that he needs to set up a more rigorous interview process. He laughed. Their pay is low, not enough to attract high quality candidates or retain them for a long time. His boss is very stingy and my uncle has to battle him for every penny. He isn't paid great, but enough to stay put and deal with it. Over the years he was able to get a somewhat satisfactory salary for few of his subordinates he likes and if a bonus comes his way, he usually splits it with the rest to keep them motivated. I met few of his ex-coworkers at his birthday party, as far as I could see there was a good understanding of the work affairs between them. He mostly tries to motivate them by being a good boss, providing training, allowing flexible hours or extra leave when possible and making them feel very comfortable. But when one of his aforementioned coworkers received a better offer, my uncle was like: ""I am glad for you, take it because we won't be able to match it"". **At the end of the day, you and your manager are in the same boat and they are limited in what they can do for you.**

* I have been with my current company for almost 7 years. Company designs medical equipment, R&D. Lots of bright, talented, educated and ambitious folks with various backgrounds. The company has few thousand employees over multiple locations. People leave all the time, our department is the one that actually delivers products. When I joined I saw few lead researchers leaving, it surely seemed like a big deal. At one time I thought the world was going to end (in other words we would't be ready to demo a product at an upcoming conference), but no, everything was fine. Some people left, new people got hired and onboarded, someone got promoted, responsibilities redistributed. His project got delayed, but projects get delayed all the time and for various reasons, someone's departure can be a drop in the bucket. Later another senior researcher left that I was sort of close with. He asked for more money, his salary at that time was ~130k, he asked for 20k more, but would have settled for 10-15k. Just the payment to an external recruiter for someone with his expertise would be 20% of his annual salary, so 20k+, this excludes time and effort required from the company to interview and onboard a person. But his project was not important enough for the company, in fact after he left they did not hire his replacement for a long time, other things were a priority. So it was either switching to another project or switching to another company, he chose the latter: smaller company, strictly focused on his area of expertise, he got much more significant pay raise. **He was sort of overqualified for his position. Leaving was a win - win for everyone.**

* Another example, one of our engineers left. He was not a PhD or anything, nevertheless it was a well established fact that he knew his shit. Asked for a raise multiple times, I don't know the numbers. He did not get it, found a better offer within weeks and left, they had to replace him fast and it wasn't easy. His relationship with his manager was not great, it was alright, but they had few pain points, mostly personal: different temper, different personalities. Not too bad overall, but not good enough for his manager to try harder to match the salary. In the bigger picture most likely for a company it'd make sense to retain him, **but personal relationships inevitably come into play and need to be considered.**

* A friend of mine was working for a government contractor. Then he got an offer from Tesla to join as a battery engineer. Hot job, hot company, good compensation, he had to move though, which meant higher cost of living, but seemed worthy. He left within 9 month and last few months he was dragging it. Simply bad work life balance, expectations of working overtime, encouraged by the company culture. He wanted to spend time with his family and on his hobbies. **Often, for a higher pay you need to sacrifice more**

* My sister-in-law is a nurse supervisor in cardiology. She was underpaid for a long time and as soon an opening became available, she switched, much happier now, same job, worse commute, more money. But the field is very specific and there are only so many hospitals around and only so many rn supervisors are needed at any given time in the area. **Average pay can be higher, but little hiring going on.**

* Switching jobs cost employees as well as employers. Stress can be significant. Looking for a job, applying, interviewing, negotiating, waiting. At the same time if you are an adult you have life that does not stop, errands piling up, your current job is demanding. So far every skilled professional 30+ I've met already has a health condition, that needs to be taken care of. Even those with a healthy lifestyle, it's either some joint injuries, back pain, migraines, headaches, etc. you name it. **Life is demanding and every bit of stress counts. New job is a new stress.**

* Last example: we had 2 new hires, recent grads from top schools. They are definitely sharp, but they started shopping around and asking for more money merely 6 months in, both left, no one tried to stop them. They weren't wrong that they could get more, and they most likely did. But I was disappointed to get them up to speed only to find out that they were already looking for a better place. Even though they were smart and promising, there are people who always actively looking, such behavior detract from they value. Always thinking about pay raise or another job takes the focus away. **So when there is time to negotiate your salary, don't be shy, but then you need to hit certain milestones, to do it again.**

*Edit: grammar.*

84,"Matt Levine write about this in his latest blog:

“There are 100 shares. A owns 90 of them, B owns 10. A lends her 90 shares to C, who shorts them all to D. Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90—there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”

Seems like it’s not quite the scandal it appears to be"
85,"Once again for the kids in the back:

Thx Matt Levine ‘Moneystuff’ if any of you wanna learn"
86,"Naked shorting is a thing. What happens when C shorts shares which he DOESN'T have to D? How about E doing the same to F? See the situation this creates? A possesses 90, B holds 10. C is on the hook for 90 non-existent shares which now belong to D. E also has to account for the 90 shares which now belong to F. Even though only 100 shares exist, there are 280 shares in ownership only balanced by 180 I.O.U.s.

Imagine having to purchase 180 shares when ONLY 100 exist."

But Socialmedia... oh no... social is baaad. Then they go and say in public, ""We need to control the markets to make sure this never happens again."" Get railed. This is the opposite of the great depression. The masses are throwing their money into the market so the billionaires have to fork over their cash. 100%, get plowed.

99,"The shares aren't really ""not real"". They are real but they have traded hands a lot. Take 4 people

A: Buys a share

B: Shorts a share, borrowing person A's share

C: Buys the share B sold

D: Shorts the share C bought. 

This creates 2 short positions based on 1 share sold. This isn't fake, this is how the market works. At the same time, technically A and C own the same share share, while C technically owns A's share its counted as 2 as well."
100,"That's entirely possible.

It's also extremely slow to unwind without tapping into the free float.

D sells a retail share to cover C's short. C sells share to market. B buys C's share to return to A

The only way that ladder works is if the lenders of shares are also selling them back into the market.

So if you have a lot of short positions to cover which you're paying for, and you need shares and fast, there are two ways to do it:

* Saturate the market with buy orders and cover your ass at any cost

* Manipulate the market

A short can be covered by the purchase of a call. A call covering a short is allowed to be naked according to SEC rules. This is done into perpetuity and one way to create counterfeit shares.

We didn't see the market saturated with buy orders. I'm leaning towards the latter but only time will tell. I think they halted the markets because they saw they didn't have the sellers to exit their shorts like they wanted."
101,"Thanks for the response. Appreciated and agreed about naked shorts with call options to cover (making them technically not naked). I will note though, that if you have person A and C not selling, both B and D have no need to cover. Add to that if they have a long call, brokers see that as neutral and wont force B and D to buy from the float. So you in a way remain stuck by holding."

113,"Yeah, it's ridiculous and screams fraud (although it might not be).

In any event, it's not ""investing"" as the term is normally used.  It's an [HFT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-frequency_trading#Strategies) fund.  

From what I've read over the years it works like this:  Stock exchanges are now, of course, 100% computers.  The exchanges exist on servers which are located in different areas across the country.  

When you put in a buy/sell order, your broker will relay this order to the various servers.  What Renaissance does is, it has top-of-the-line direct internet connections to the various servers.  So it will, say, see you want to buy some stock on Server A.  It then goes and buys that stock on servers B, C, and D before *your* buy order even gets to those servers over the network.  It then relists it for a small profit-- and sells it to you.

So it's basically a form of frontrunning using network latency.  Virtually risk-less.

Their argument to regulators is that this is providing market liquidity."

C) was a dead beat that never payed child support to my grandparents for taking care of me even though the agreement was literally under the table payments so the didn’t drag his ass to court 


D) and for the double whammy of shitty parent lottery my mother never saved for my college like she was supposed to after the divorce and I basically lost out on 20 grand that would have payed like 75% of the loans I have currently and constantly begged me to borrow money(learned my lesson with dear old dad).

At least I could trust my grandparents with their name on my checking account and my taxes. there were a couple times gram wanted to see the statements because she didn’t like some things(I think it was over MTG cards and I wasn’t even spending that much on them) I was spending my money on by I basically told her to fuck off she wasn’t the one working and putting money into it and my decision was accepted and she never asked again.

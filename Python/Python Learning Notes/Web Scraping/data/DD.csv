&#x200B;

Guys think about what is REALLY happening here!!

The hedge funds dont matter that much, yes they are the degenerates that think every trade they make will never go tits up. The reason this trade is working is because SHARES THAT DONT EVEN EXIST HAVE BEEN SHORTED!!

Who made this risky ass loan (because shorting shares is borrowed shares meaning loaned)???

Why are brokerages restricting/suspending trading shares/options/ANYTHING related to the underlying? They shouldn't give a fuck if you lose money right? THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE AT RISK!!! THEY MADE RISKY FUCKING LOANS THINKING IT CANT GO TITS UP.

This is why GME is the only play, its the only one shorted above 100% float!! THEY ARE CAUGHT WITH THERE FUCKING PANTS DOWN AND ARE DESPERATE TO NOT GET CAUGHT.

WASSUP LEIMAN BROS!!!??!?!

Ahem. Not financial advice, I just like commenting on shit and love this stock"
1,"There's some good DD in here that shows up in the evening usually. But right now I literally have no idea how to make sense of anything, there's plots within plots within plots, and am just glad my share average is $70 cuz I'm not depending on a squeeze to get out of this ok"
2,"Jesus there isn't even DD anymore just ""ticker"" and tons of 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, I can't fucking believe it."
3,"I honestly felt truly emotionally terrorized the last few days with their tactics.  The systematic shut down of our trading apps, Reddit, discord, negative media spin, MM coming in droves to call us barbarians, idiots and criminals.  I bought into GME in December because I liked the fundamentals and I like to invest my hard earned money into companies I like and believe in. To demonize people for doing their own DD, who have an interest in trading stock in a FREE market, who maybe are crass most of the time and smart none of the time...to incite us into this terroristic frenzy is disgusting."
4,"There's no need for DD anymore, a shitload has already been done and the hard parts over. We just need to hold."

ELI5 explaination is it gives investor a monetary reason to make sure a company is actually worth a damn. If it's not you can go short and make money on the way down due to your amazing DD finding a shitty scam company."
32,"Yet another meaningless conspiracy theory touted by “all of a sudden righteous” wsb. The hunt brothers were two people and they damn near succeeded, this sub has nearly 7 million....do the math. It’s true that The fed changed margin requirements in the 80s and silver futures plummeted. BUT The dd here relies on buying physical silver so when the the short future contracts who need to deliver come calling, there’s no silver to purchase and we start asking for high prices. I’ve said it many times but who TF cares who else is on the long side if this trade is going to rain tendies down like no other. Do YOUR OWN research and stop trying to prioritize social justice and sticking it to the establishment over making heaps of money. No I’m not a bot.  Bee bloop bleep. Slv could easily moon. Read the DD."

35,"10k is not a gaurentee, it will require discipline for months that is super likely to fall apart. GME is not the only stock. SLV will go up this week. I like silver, tons of good non-bot DD on silver, GME is not the only game in town.

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

42,"Umm, unsure if you haven't noticed most of the DD lately has been fabrication. 

Remember, last month Vanguard and Fidelity were the beacons of light. Today they are dumping shares to bring down the price? They don't' actively manage their index funds...."
43,"Triple level DD!

Hedgie haterzz gonna hate"
44,"Understood, was more rhetorical. I've tried also but it generally just gets ignored. 

I get the situation and what happened and all that. But making things up to push this is not right. Too much DD based on complete fabrication like you said."
45,"I am a retard and so probably wrong, but for anyone who hasnt watched or read any of u/deepfuckingvalue DD: he believed in this company being a $40-$60 company. With all the free press Gamestop has gotten and will continue to get, at the absolute minimum this is a $40 stock. 
So those worried about losing it all, just know this stock is not settling below $40 even if everyone pulls out. Even if it goes below, its going right back over $40 as smart money buys the dip. Now maybe that will change a year or more out if Cohen cant transition this company into the digital marketplace but for this year, this stock has a lot of potential to succeed even after the squeeze.
So realistic worse case scenario is you lose 2/3 of the current share value. Best case scenario which we all know is VERY realistic, is that this thing rockets over $1000. Its a once in a lifetime opportunity for a slingshot past Mars! 
Plus, you can stick it to these hedge funds, corrupt businesses, media companies and politicians backing the hedge funds. 

I dont know what im taking about, but neither do the people saying this will go back below $20. Hedge funds all over shorted this company initially when it was below $25 and they wont recoup that. No chance. This company has potential to succeed even past the squeeze, dont forget that when making your personal risk analysis"
46,"I love all of this DD from people with little to no previous technical commentary on their accounts. This guy’s post history is stuff like “how do I factory reset my iPhone” and “hey I’m 20 years old and what is the crapto currency” and “is it worth YOLOing on this week’s shitcoyn de jure?” Next up he swings in here, slaps a massive fatty on the table, and says “listen up retards, let me give you the skinny on what in the exact fuck is happening with this market play” talking about short squeezes and market volatility, trading volumes, ladders, SEC filings, and counterfeit shares.   
    
Can I blame him? No. Kid likes the stock. 

Live long and YOLO, sweet rarts. And never change.

47,"This\^\^ needs to be pinned so all noobs can read this. Maybe add to the heading to ""GME holders must read!!!"" coz this is some good DD for the new members and paper hands."
48,Suddenly this guy is writing long ass DD sigh this sub has been flooded with desperation
49,"HOLD THE LINE!!!

This is not financial advice. I  like the stock. Do your own DD."
50,"Couldn't have said it better myself. 

The thought of missing out on a once in a lifetime opportunity because I was ""unsure"" if the squeeze would happen or not terrifies me.

The piece of mind that I would gain by holding regardless of squeeze or not is worth the potential hit to my bank account. 

As always, only put in what you're willing to lose.

&#x200B;

\*Not financial advice whatsoever, I'm slow very often, so do your own DD."
51,"AMC is a meme, you are gambling with it. I haven't seen any DD remotely close to the effort that went into the GME squeeze"
52,"This 100%. People should have been in before this stock hit $50. I got in in the teens dropping 8k on it. Got enough to buy a small house and some property by me so I’m happy with the gains. I dipped at 380ish. 

The squeeze was killed by the trading restrictions. Simple as that. 

There was a great DD write up on GameStop a while back that compared its financials and assets which estimated the stock should have been around $150 a share if it wasn’t being shorted to the fucking ground. 

I was gonna dip at $150 but it skyrocketed so fast lol. Sucks I didn’t get out in the 400s but at least I won’t be one of the many WSB loss porn providers"
53,"I’ve been on the sidelines of this as well. In fact, I had $BB in my portfolio from a play weeks before, and when I saw that WSB was jumping in to pump it up, I immediately sold. Why? I’ve worked in investment banking compliance and regulatory enforcement for years. I was laid off, but planned to return to the same field at some point. I’m trading for the first time in years (I’m not really allowed to while employed) and didn’t want to get caught in the SEC dragnet that is likely coming. 

But something in me snapped. I closed positions that I had done plenty of *real* DD/fundamentals analysis and had planned to hold through the pandemic. And I’m in for $GME because fuck this - I’ve worked for YEARS trying to ensure that these fuckers played by the rules and for what?! This shit is insidious, and I don’t want to be associated with holding back retail investors to protect stupid hedge fund positions that have an extreme risk from the start. BURN IT ALL DOWN AND HOLD TILL THEY ARE BLED DRY. 💸💸💸"
54,">e bag when this is over. Some everyday people are risking a lot here. But, what if every retail investor came to the decision that they would not sell for a penny less than, say, $10000? No ifs or buts, $10000. The price wouldn't go down, would it? Because the shorters have to buy a greater amount than what we're holding, and no one has to drop their price until the shorters have closed their positions.  
>  
>Just speaking hypothetically. Not saying we should collude or anything, that would be illegal. Just that I like the stock so much that I think it is worth exactly $10000. Although if I saw some good DD I could be convinced it is higher.

Sell Limit as 10K! SET!"
55,"If you think the silver squeeze is fake, you should really do some DD. Yeah some of them have huge stash of silver however, that doesn’t mean they didn’t over short the stuff. That being said, the GME squeeze need to happen first. It doesn’t need to be GME vs silver it should be GME->silver if you really want to hurt those bandits."
56,"$PSLV is the play. They buy actual bullion.

There is a squeeze in silver: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7uvcg/we_are_doing_silver_squeeze_wrong/ <—— lots of DD by this guy

I’m also just a retard and not offering any financial advice."
57,"All the good DD on silver is by accounts who have been posting on wsb for at least a year, so you can take off the tinfoil hat. Of course you will see a lot of new accounts commenting, we just got 5 million new members! Don’t worry, gme will go up, and i hold it too. No one is gonna take your tendies. Let’s not turn this sub into an indoctrinated cult."
58,"I mean 2008 was just over a decade ago. People thought something like that wouldn't happen again...

...and it did. 

In the short run it's gonna suck because we'll see a bunch of shills coming over here trying to make up a bullshit DD for whatever they're shilling. It'll be a long time before we see another DFV."
59,"Silver is going through a supply shortage which has other consequences for shorters like JPM that are losing their ability to steer the ship. It really depends if futures markets get pinched on real delivery, if that happens then there well could be an actual short squeeze, but that is nothing the likes of WSB can initiate by itself like GME was, the market is just too damned big and global.

That said, I still think the DD on silver is pretty good on a longer time frame. Industrial production *needs it*, and its in short supply."
60,"Fool me once shame on me for not doing my DD, fool me twice and I’ll prob wanna do it again because I get off to loss."
61,Honestly my plan is sacrilege on this one. I am probably going to sacrifice my money to the tendie gods. Then roll whats left into my actual retard DD long play of Intel. I'm in a sizable amount of GME at $60ish that I'll never sell and bag hold to $0 because I won't catch the peak to get to FU money. And my ape brethern here that have posted stories of their real hardships but holding the line deserve any real shot I can give them to get out ahead. They are the real heros and what little assistance I can provide for them to get out okay is the least I can do.
62,"I'm one of the newcomers here and I genuinely like this sub. The loss porn, people buying stuff for shits and grins(with a DD) and getting a kick out of it whether it goes down or up. The people here seem cool and thats all I'll preface this with.

I felt similarly. I heard about the hype and figured whatever I'll give it a shot and see what happens. I bought 40 shares of AMC because I figured it made more sense than 2 shares of GME. I decided to keep it to about 500 because I wasn't willing to lose more if it went tits up. I didnt really think about the message of this post until later so thankfully I'm a little bit of a coward, financially speaking. 

I just to say that I read some of the people posts about loans of using retirement or whatever they were and while I don't know their financial situation and can only know mine some of the numbers actually worried me what I was seeing. I genuinely hope the stocks go back up. Not for me but those people. 

Guys and gals, it's been a real lesson and learning experience. I hope the $ROPE joke is just that. A joke. The main reason Im writing this is to say this.

People need to learn how to do legitimate DD, not read WSB fake-DD, before investing more than play money."

67,"After reading the big DD last night I had a bit of a deflated feeling asking myself: now what am I supposed to do till 3/19? 

I know that’s not a legit date... but I realized in that moment I really want the feeling of hope and a roller coaster ride every market day. I look forward to Mondays now. Life is weird. Life is great. This is the way."
68,"Don't just blindly believe in 3/19.  Part of the game they're playing is being unpredictable (fear **uncertainty** doubt), and that 3/19 DD is now very much on their radar.  There are 3 times as many $800 calls for 3/5 than there are for 3/19.  Expect some next level fuckery in the weeks to come."
69,What I wouldn’t give for some solid DD and loss porn right about now.  I recently filtered posts by top all time.  Almost everything is from today alone.  We’ve gotten way too big.
70,"I made a shitpost two days ago about how we need another paper trading competition and like 90% of the comments were people who are clearly to fucking new to this sub. I hate being a gatekeeper but these people are flooding the sub with their bullshit and I hate it. Last three days of this sub is about how we're in a fucking war with the billionaires and is filled with fucking twitter screenshots and ""hedgefunds bad"" and all I want is solid DD and some loss porn to make me feel better about myself."

72,"They’ll get bored immediately when this dies down, give it 2 weeks mate, then back to DD and loss porn"
73,"Your right it wasn't about taking them down, it was about solid DD, but after the shit they pulled in the left few days it certainly is about taking those fuckers down. The chairman of IB was on CNBC literally laughing at us saying they'd only allow buying of GME when it drops to it's ""true value"" of $17. If that doesn't piss you off you need to ask your wife's boyfriend for your balls back mate."
74,"This. i think many of the new members are only here to watch the show, i would love to see some new DD but like it or not WSB has a significant hand in this dumpster fire now.   
Just gonna have to wait it out and stay true to our roots. don't let the newbies create a new narrative in the long run. We do NOT want to appear organized."
75,"Same, but enjoy the ride while it’s here my fellow retard, this will only happen once, sir back, relax, head to the moon and enjoy yourself. Then we are back to DD and loss porn"

77,"THIS IS NOW PERSONAL AND I AM HOLDING. 💎✋


I'm holding on with 💎✋ for everything I couldn't hold on to in 2020. Like so many others last year, my life was completely screwed over by Covid. I lost my job. I lost my dream home and living situation. I lost my carefully laid plans. Worst of all, I lost the man I love. I had to move back in with my parents. I had no income for most of the year. I had to cope with a devastating breakup while social distancing from friends. 


Life has been absolute hell, and if the choices had been mine, I would have held on with 💎✋ to all of the things I lost last year. I would have held onto my job. I would have held on to my dream home. I would have held on to my partner. My god, I would have held him my whole life if he had let me. Those things were out of my control. I could not hold on to them, but dammit, I can hold on to this. 💎✋ I feel empowered being able to simply hold onto something I like. And I like the stock. 🚀 I did my DD. 


I'm a newbie trader, but the dips haven't made me flinch one time. They are doing everything they can to scare us into selling, but I don't have no 🧻✋.

82,"You’re wrong. AMC is over 100% shorted now. It CAN be a GME situation. You’re simply wrong if you don’t think so.

&#x200B;

# I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is  💎🙌 ).

Who    would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated    by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering  the   price down to 170$ the day before?

Every    single day we  💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's    boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've    already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all    the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting    by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but    some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and    what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).    They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will  be   reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive   the  stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).    TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right    now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME  has a   way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on  the   ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused  by   social media clout the past week).

PART  2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys,  *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*.   Fuck off,  please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read   half-assed DDs in  the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering,   in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's    boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your  🧻  🙌 is   unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking    Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These   are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond   full of gold we're  drinking from right now. There will be more, so   please, LISTEN to my  TL;DR.

84,"AMC isn’t a distraction lol. It is extremely heavily shorted and the entry price is low enough that people can get in early if they like. You’re being silly.

Read some [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)"
85,"This is brilliant!!! 

Added to my list of DD sites!"
86,">  When the squeeze happens with AMC and BB there is a ceiling they will hit before they start falling again and it is up to the investor to pick his exit point.

BB isn't even a short squeeze. People think it's hugely undervalued for what they offer and is a good longer term play. Read the DD on it.

You are largely right about AMC though from the very little research I've put in on that one. The price will go up, but it will hit a much lower number than GME and I feel like a lot more people are going to get burned."
87,"This. Don’t worry man there will be more opportunities to make big multipliers on your investment in the future. Trust me I’m kicking myself for not buying into GME at $29 when I was debating it.

Although the GME situation is unique, there will always be other opportunities and it is definitely smart to dump into AMC and BB after doing your due diligence. As others have said the majority of ppl pushing GME and calling other ppl pushing other stocks “bots” is because they bought into the GME hype late and want people to buy it as-well. Once things move on the money will be dumped into other places. Just keep monitoring and following what’s going on and doing your DD."
88,"Key here is AMC is another Melvin holding I believe"" do your DD"" So I got 20@10 in the wake of GME they are further shorting their other holdings.

This is his best effort from feb 1: 

*"" This is why their recent recommendation to go long SLV makes sense and  could continue to be an extremely profitable play. In other words, the  fundamentals back the recent price increases we have seen in this ETF.  However, according to reports on CNBC this morning, it is unclear  whether or not the SLV thread came from genuine longtime Reddit's  WallStreetBets traders or large professional traders posting on this  forum to bid the price of silver higher. ""*"
90,"Here’s the problem.. if you search silver and sort by the DD flair there WERE heavily upvoted, heavily awarded pro-silver posts before the news reported this. It was buried by GME and everything else. People were commenting positively and they weren’t obvious bots or anything.

Obviously there are more posts about NOT buying silver after this was in the news... but the news was reporting on something semi credible. You can search it yourself.

I don’t believe wsb is solely responsible for a silver jump, but to say there was not ANY popular silver posts here before this is not true. We should be spreading factual shit.

92,"> Crayon manufacturers can no longer keep up with the demand.

Is that DD for next meme stonk?"
93,"Posting this from my reply in another thread. This implications of your DD on this is that we're busy playing with the counterfeit shares, while the real trading is happening above our pay grade -

People are reporting with screenshots that fractional shares from RH were sold for $2605 with them receiving the fractional amount.

There's no such thing as a fractional share so that's one of Robin Hoods own shares being sold for $2605. It seems their backend system has tattled on them.

I saw lots of people mentioning seeing $2000 asks on Friday as well.

I think they're trading before it hits retail to cover between themselves.

That would also provide a good reason their deposit requirements for the stock became so high.

This is getting juicy.

95,"Yes. OP + your post + Michael Burry's tweet regarding delay on shares delivery + a full understanding of [this conclusive thesis](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) = all of the fuel we need for 💎 🧤 if we want to hit a meaningful price target and enact any possible institutional change.

These pieces of combined information are the most important forms of weaponizable DD that any long can have in their arsenal."
96,"Let's raise our kids to be sharper then. It took one person to find a kink in the armor. It'll be harder, but Wallstreet will slip up again, and when they do I hope the next generation has multiple DFVs to post DD."

98,"This is what we want guys.

Good DD with some numbers to back it up.

Don't start threads about 'Who is HOLDING'.

Edit: my post is back up! Thank you mods and thank you guys for bringing awareness! I'm still shadow banned though I am unable to submit new posts or comments on this subreddit 😢  
  
MODS please don't delete! This is actual DD of just statistical, cold hard facts. My previous post got deleted, if this one does too, spread the word.  
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)—or 125% (25 ÷ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but Robinhood who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when Robinhood's order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME can still be squoze for all the aforementioned reasons above. Thank you for taking your time to read my DD, please mods do not delete."
102,"As a 💎🙌🦍 that is holding until the squeeze or bust, I love DD posts like this. Not because it convinced me to hold (since I’m holding regardless) but because it gives me more confidence and reassurance that there’s still hope and a chance of this long shot happening.

107,YES! It has returned! Fantastic DD. Needs to be seen!
108,Why is all the DD getting removed?
109,"Solid DD

Meet me at the back of Wendy’s."
110,Can we get an explanation as to why this top tier DD post got deleted and the poster banned temporarily? That's kind of a big fucking mistake in the wake of the mod coup attempt.
111,"Thanks for this DD, good stuff, sir.

I was wondering that on iBorrowDesk data fees are declining so does that mean also that borrowing stocks for shorts are much more affordable than it was on the beginning of the week? And that is actually playing against us as they need to pay less in between and allows them to dump share price further down?"
112,Hey i was just about to read this post.... why do mods keep deleting DD?
113,"Wow post removed? Totally nothing fucky going on here Ha HA!

Edit: act as if WSB is still compromised because it most certainly is, please be careful gentleman and only read DD posts. Nothing else.

I hope I don’t get shadow banned been here since 300k members and this is the worst state I think I have ever seen the sub."
114,"Finally, some good fucking DD"
115,Nothing like posting DD to get you banned.
116,"This. 

Anyone that was here pre January will agree behind the motion of diamond-handing GME. I'm still positioned on this stock because there are just too many questions that haven't been resolved, coupled in with a massive disinformation campaign and the other bullshit we have seen throughout the week to throw us off the scent. 

We need to do our DD though, to protect our backs, our pockets and eachother from prying eyes of those who have infiltrated this sub from the enemies side.

Also my wife's boyfriend wants me to pick-up some beers for him on the way home from work. Is bud light a good choice to go for?"
117,"If you read some more DD they panicked and covered what they could.

I think they are betting that we get tired of GME and we give up on it by March/April.

And if you like conspiracy theories you can see how many shills there are and look into their profiles and see how long they actually spend on here trying to spread negativity.

Really. If you are suffering from GME Fatigue would you really spend 6-8 hours a day talking about it?"
118,This is more convincing than the actual DD boosting my confidence. I'll see if I'm simply throwing more money into the fire on Monday.
119,"Thank you, moo! But sketchy shit happening. I've been seeing so many DD and ideas being removed."
120,"I disagree, I’d say it’s a long shot not because the numbers don’t add up but simply because of the game we’re playing. Make no mistake, it is the little guy vs the big guy and we ARE the little guy and we’re playing the big guys game. To say it’s inevitable because the numbers add up is naive imo. Yes the numbers and DD (and hopefully the SI on the 9th) point to hedge cunts being overextended on shorts and being big gains and potential on a squeeze, but without the proper momentum and attention/publicity, there could also easily not be a squeeze. I think staying in the game and holding is the right move, but just like in blackjack and poker, making the right move doesn’t always mean you’re going to win"
121,Well those definitely need to be deleted. I’ve sent some to buddies that later have been deleted that were decent DD.
122,"I think the calls being bought at the nose bleed prices serve two purposes:

1) it’s a hedge against any near term substantial squeeze, and you can buy in volume at this strike price given the high IV, and
2) they can be used to mask the magnitude of your short position, if indeed that DD floating around about that is true.

The intensity of the all the fud (which is pretty much emotional abuse now) has only made me suspicious of any numbers implying I should abandon position. At least it doesn’t cost me anything to hold and the price is letting me average down. Setting alerts for $150 and $200. 💎👐"
123,"How is what you guys have turned this fkn sub into not exactly the same thing? Buying shares as a cartel with the stated intention of driving the price up so that someone else (shorts) have to buy from you is blatant market manipulation. We were fine when we were just long GME, BB, etc for the DD but all these new assholes are like “hey let’s make a short squeeze happen and screw the hedge funds!” Also who tf you morons think is selling you shares at 300/share? The fkn hedge funds going short again smh"
124,Their loss if they're not on here every night with us for that DD. They could be making them gainz and fighting for the average Joe with us.
125,"I miss the old WSB. Glad we have foot soldiers but I miss the great DD, fun banter, and seeing things that can’t go tits up, go tits up."
126,I’m long dog shitting in house. I HAVE DIAMOND HANDS BITCH Even if he’s well trained he’s gonna get old and eventually won’t be able to control it. That’s some serious DD *not a financial advisor do your own DD*
127,"I think they're concerned new people coming here are susceptible to the group mentality with no understanding of market mechanics or DD.

Little do they realize it's just retards leading the retards in a giant circle jerk of memes. It's why new people keep asking to be told what to do.

Gotta keep telling them we're all retards and should not listen to us while spouting our own autistic notions with zero financial advice."
128,"Yeah, people buying into the group mentality is worrying me. I'm not looking forward to two weeks time when a bunch of people who dropped hundred of dollars into shares without any DD suddenly realise they lost a lot of money and start making ""what do I do now?"" posts.

Some people are that dumb that I made 3-4% on GM shares because people didn't even know what they were buying and started investing in the motor company.

I also think OP genuinely means don't try and organise too. That's just going to cause its own problems for the sub and retail traders as a whole."
129,Delete and ban.  Politics waaayyyy outside scope of WSB.  Misuse of DD flair.
130,Wow this is some of the best DD I've seen here. Would be cool to overlay the buy/sells on the stock charts and then see who is the most profitable scumbag politician.
131,"Hey, since apparently even *the news* is reporting on what our bots do/don't do and acting like what we're doing is some reaction to GME, this is what's actually going on.

Most subreddits use a rule like ""You can't talk unless your account is over 30 days old"", but there are spammer that have accounts that are ancient, slightly aged, and everything in between.

We decided to go with ""The first time you comment or submit it will be removed and you'll have to have 30 days elapse before you can freely post"", with some caveats.

**For comments**:

A) You, as a new user, can comment on threads whose flair is  'Weekend Discussion', 'Daily Discussion', 'Discussion Thread'. 

B) You *can't* reply to other people's submissions.

**For submissions**:

A) You can't submit unless it's a Gain/Loss/YOLO that follows the rules

B) You can submit DD

The intention is to make people lurk for a while before they can just post willy nilly. A lot of people were getting upset and pointing to DD from new users that didn't get through so I made an exception for DD.

Believe it or not, a lot of those commenters on your submissions are people that have been here for a while.

I know it kinda sucks and I'm sorry especially if you're an oldbro that got caught in the filter because you didn't talk at the right time before we turned it on, but I'm doing the best I can to keep things somewhat normal."
132,"Thanks for this. It’s actually nice to know others are scared. My dad and brother-in-law both panic sold their shares this am, but I’ve resolved to hold. I’ve been doing what DD I can, and this sub is helping to calm some of my doubts. I know it’s possible that shit hits the fan for me, but so far it seems the numbers still add up to come out on top. 40 GME @ 275 💎🤲🏼"
133,I’m in the boat of being a lurker who wanted to post DD for the first time during all this mess 😂
134,When did you decide to let DD through? All my DD posts have been auto deleted during the last few days.
135,"There is plenty of DD on what could trigger the squeeze, i just gave an example how it will work."
136,"DD: Bezos was a Hedge Fund Manager in the 90's. Amazon is merely his ""I'm done"" life project."
137,Don't question the DD
138,"There is a difference between an autist choosing to make a bet on little to no DD, and a massive campaign to convince literal millions of new traders to buy into a precarious position. 

The yolo bet is met with “good luck retard.” If it blows up its funny, because they chose that position. They weren’t convinced by a mob that the position was the only choice they had if they wanted to participate in this sub. 

Don’t claim that the current state of the GME play is a classic YOLO. It’s a sustained campaign to stay in a position at all costs to the tune of 50+ posts an hour convincing you that any and all evidence to the contrary is a conspiracy theory. 

Position: bought 725 GME shares at $11 and more at $20 (called away through CCs), bought various calls throughout the last few months, sold covered calls and cash secure puts, currently holding a [$4500 800c for the meme](https://imgur.com/a/LCNb0H7) and 5 shares at $300 cost basis. I want this thing to go to $1000 but the information campaign at war against reality is going to hurt a lot of people and skew their ability to make an informed judgement on how they should exit."
139,"OP doesn't understand order flow of how a short ladder works. Point taken, but before you claim a wrinkle in your  brain maybe understand that there is real, actual, DD happening here on a daily basis. Go take your series 7 and come back here saying it's a bet. It's a foregone conclusion that this thing rockets. The only real variables are how far and when. 

But yeah, a lot of whining bitches on this sub. That being said it's a small percentage of the 8m subs, they just stand out because most of the posts here usually stroke our collective eggplants."
140,"Fuck the doubters. I went in after shit blew up and I knew I was buying inflated prices. PRICE DOES NOT MATTER RIGHT NOW. GME is on sale the GOAL is to BUY and HOLD.

The market might DRIVE that price into the goddamn dirt and then they need to find a seller. Let them drive it down, and then we buy the fuck out of it when its cheap again. Then when they have their fabled $1 stock, they go to cover their shorts. fucking scary right? WRONG! This is where absolutely nobody sells and then the shorts ask us how much we would like for the stock.

Coloured wax is my delicacy of choice and my understanding of the market could be dead wrong. This is not financial advice, I like the stock and I have faith.Do your own DD, and never invest more than you're comfortable losing."
141,"It's been a struggle to find real solid DD and separate those who know what they are saying vs. the 90% of people here who are new. Recently it sounds like a fever pitch in here and the conspiracy theories are getting wilder and wilder.  In googling around and trying to learn about Short Ladders attack, search results have one article from 2014 and then the rest are all in the last 3 days from here. I'm not saying a short ladder attack isn't real but if you all truly believe every time the stock drops it's a ladder attack, then I think you don't understand that a lot of people are in fact selling. Volume down? Yes, but price is up - every time price doubles, volume halves- it's still the same $ amount moving. So. these things are repeated over and over again, and I think we are repeating some false (or at least misunderstood) truths here. 

For sure, sketchy and even illegal things have happened - the entire robinhood blocking purchases and tanking the price I think was a seminal moment that \*may\* have killed this whole thing, because I think when the share price dropped it gave the opportunity for a lot of cover. Everyone says volume is low but they are still trading 30, 40 million shares a day - lots of that could be covering. Not saying it is, but none of us seem to really know if what S3 is saying about covering is right. 

My positions: 137 shares at appx $88 cost basis. I'm still holding. But I recognize there is a risk it doesn't spike again. Then again, if DFV is holding, I'm holding. 🚀"
142,This is ultra instinct saiyan god tier level equivalent DD comparable to the moon phase gme guy😥📈
143,Former Nabisco employee. Don’t forget the release of Game of Thrones Oreos that lead to the worst finale of one the greatest series. Clear correlation and DD
144,This is the kind of DD you won't find on CNBC or anywhere else. Well done!
145,"Im gonna say your DD is almost and I mean it, almost perfect. You just left out Mega Stuf Oreo, introduced in February 2013, similar to Double Stuf Oreo cookies, but with even more white creme filling. This one didn't have an effect on the market. Anyway I'm gonna go put half of my savings into VIX just because of some oreos xd"
146,This is unprecedented DD like any I have seen before. I wait with great anticipation of how the market responds.
147,This is very thorough work. So many indicators to measure yet you navigated to the perfect correlation. I was very encouraged to see the imminent arrival of Popeye’s Chicken to the UK coinciding with GME breaking back into 3 figures. But my pool of indicators to study was limited. You elevate us all with the quality of your DD.
148,"*puts down coke tray* 

This is some fucking quality DD"
149,I must say that it took me a while to read this highly sophisticated DD. Brace yourselves for the upcoming red tsunami
150,This is the DD we need.
151,Of all the DD fckn red white and blue oreos topple it all down for Fourth of July. Hot damn.. buckle up boissss
152,This is serious DD. You’re missing the flair
153,"Hahahaha this DD kills me, too funny"
154,"This is the greatest DD I have ever read.

Mods, sticky this."
155,"DD.. ish

Lol"
156,"The most comprehensive DD I've read in a long time.

SPY puts, 3, 2, 1!"
157,Finally some real fucking DD comes back to this sub. Thats damn fine work retard. Have a cookie.
158,Now this is my kind of DD.
159,Lehman with the five head DD
160,I’m proud of you son.  I like seeing that you put as much into your DD as you do you doordashing.
161,#THIS DD IS BEST DD
162,"And people say there’s no good DD anymore, would you look at this? Makes perfect sense to my “I like turtles” precious brain"
163,Man.. id never forget the DD for running that show the the ground T_T
164,The real DD is in the comments
165,No longer employee but based off my DD yes.
166,"Can't spell Lil Yachty without Yacht, solid DD post."
167,Same. This DD is the best proof of correlation equals causation that I’ve ever seen. Bravo
168,"Did we moon on super moon?
Enough DD for today.
Take my fucking money the tide is high"
169," I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is 💎🙌 ).

Who would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering the price down to 170$ the day before?

Every single day we 💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme). They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will be reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive the stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME has a way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on the ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused by social media clout the past week).

PART 2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys, *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*. Fuck off, please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read half-assed DDs in the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering, in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your 🧻 🙌 is unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond full of gold we're drinking from right now. There will be more, so please, LISTEN to my TL;DR.

170,"OP left out an important aspect. Every day that Melvin can't get hold of the Switches the parents have already paid for, he has to pay a forfeit to each parent for their trouble of waiting for them. And the more expensive these Switches get on the market, the higher the forfeit, because these parents should by rights already have these Switches, regardless of how expensive they've gotten. Melvin tries to put off paying the higher market price as long as possible in the hopes that it will eventually go down. Eventually the forfeits become so large, Melvin has no choice but to swallow his just desserts and just pay market price for the Switches.


At least that's how my retarded brain interpreted it, but I'm just a dumb ape, don't listen to me. I'm just holding GME because I believe in the company! 💎🙌🚀 


Edit: thanks for the interest in/support for this post, RIP my inbox afterwards. A lot of the questions below are easily answered if you just Google the terms. https://www.investopedia.com/ is a good starting point. Any terms there you don't understand, likewise Google them. This should all be part of your DD/research. If you can't do that, you've no place trading. Any questions regarding speculation, I know as much as you do. We're all retarded in here.


P.S. I f*cking love GameStop 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
171,The real DD is in the comments.
172,"Definitely a talking point. I've implored people I know personally not to get on board unless they've done all their research/DD to know exactly what's going on, and as with all investing, don't invest what you can't afford to lose."
173,"WSB is where we have diamond hands, rocket ships and brains with <1 wrinkle. If you include 2 (two) emoji's you are legally obliged to flair your post as DD. We are the literal peak of hivemindism. If you are here for GME please tell me what a SELL button is cause I DONT FUCKING SEE IT"
174,Happy to be part. Now will you fuckheads please explain to this retard what DD means?
175,"I'm struggling to make the large purchase thing work - not really understanding it. Trying to adjust the savings amount and also incorporate what I've already saved, and weird things are happening. It might also be because I use DD/MM/YYYY date format? I've tried changing the date formatting, but it messes with the graph.  
But THANK YOU for this - it's BEAUTIFUL. I have a tracking spreadsheet I already use, but I've been struggling with pre-planning budgeting lately, so even though I track my expenses, I still end up spending more than I should. But this one is perfect and so pretty!"
176,"New FTD data is out!

The Failure to Deliver data from the second half of January is out!  It's about what you'd expect:

1/20	1,007,562

&#x200B;

Oh, wow!  That is a huge number of FTDs!!  But I guess they covered, because it jumps down so much at 1/29, right?  Well, in addition to potentially covering that number by shorting more, look at our friendly GME heavy ETF (XRT):

1/15	10,187

1/19	9,134

1/20	1,144

1/21	17,703

1/27	80,112

1/28	385,651

1/29	2,218,348

In two weeks XRT goes from having about 10,000 FTDs to OVER TWO MILLION.  That is fucking enormous.  This shit is huge, and they are willing to do anything to try and get away with it.  This is not financial advice--I'm just a monkey counting bananas promised versus bananas given.

[Here's the link to yesterday's comments.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m16emz/gme_megathread_for_march_09_2021/gqd7afb/) I will edit this comment with my thoughts on GME throughout the day. 

Please forgive me about the confusion yesterday. My last comment got deleted without an explanation. I did not delete my comments. This caused a lot of panic for those following along. Mods, if there is anything I am doing wrong, please let me know so I can correct and prevent another take down.

For Corporate America, I offer you this DD.

**[Concerning Apes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pGaz_qN0cw)**

Apes have been living and farming in the four Farthings of Reddit for many hundreds of years. Quite content to ignore and be ignored by the world of the Bulls and Bears — Corporate America being, after all, full of strange creatures beyond count. Apes must seem of little importance, being neither renowned as great warriors, nor counted among the very wise.

In fact, it has been remarked by some that the Apes' only real passion is for Bananas. A rather unfair observation, as we have also developed a keen interest in the brewing of juice, and the smoking of crayons. But where our hearts truly lie is in peace and quiet, and good tilled DD. For all Apes share a love of Stonks that 🚀🚀🚀.

And yes, no doubt, to others our ways seem quaint. But today, of all days, it is brought home to me, it is no bad thing to celebrate a simple life.

Together, Ape Strong

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the 🚀, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their 🍌🍌🍌 for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

The North American Apes follow the rest of the world Apes into a frenzy. 500,000 did nothing to slow GME's ascent and is continuing it's upward trajectory. The Short Hedge Investors and Traders (SHITs or SHITers) are in serious trouble as the Apes continue to demand more and more for their stock. The growth has been exponential and there is no end in sight. 

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current price: 290.82

**Update 10:51**

A small 50,000 sedative short shot was injected into the Apes, which took the stock below 290 for a small bit. After being dazed for a bit, the Apes have continued their rampage, demanding the price go above 295. Upward momentum is still in full force, though it might not be as strong as opening bell. Once the shot wears off, we might see another climb.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 294.00

**Update 11:25**

Welcome back onboard $300 Apes. It is truly a beautiful sight to see Apes band together and care for one another. The apes continue the climb, eyeing Apes left at 400 and beyond. What an incredible story for the Apes. You don't see this kind of community with Bears or Bulls. Apes truly care for one another and want nothing but 🍌🍌🍌 for all.

* Shorts available: 300,000

* Current price: 305.96

**Update 12:07**

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

They used 50,000 shorts, but Apes don't care. GME is nearly $100 ahead of where it ended yesterday and it's showing no signs of slowing down. GME might break 400 before EOD.

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price : 340.26

**Update 12:23 Halt**

That was strange. This is where I wish I knew how long shorts borrowed have until they enter the market. Remember how they borrowed 500,000 prior to opening bell? I wouldn't be surprised if all those were just fired at GME in a coordinated attack. This also happens during lunch? Seems suspicious to me. We'll definitely have more information as time goes on, but this is definitely a strange development. We'll see how GME reacts after the halt.

GME just exited the halt and things are volatile. Please buckle up and hold on tight. 

* Shorts available: 250,000

* Current price: 276.00

**Update 12:31 Halt #2**

Holy shit. We're at another halt. This seems like a really desperate attempt to cut off the GME fuel. I don't think anyone legit believes that drop was natural.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 248.68

**Update 12:36 Halt #3**

ANOTHER HALT! GME is now down 30 from where it ended yesterday. The SHITers need to do something drastic and this is it. They're trying to get people to panic sell. They're trying to get people to leave their position. I don't think anyone is buying it though. This is so clearly manipulation.

*Shorts available: 200,000

Someone yesterday said “Diamond hands are easy on the way down, the true test is on the way up”. I think about that a lot lately. 

I’m profitable. And I so badly want to hedge myself and sell off shares. I keep setting targets and then waking up to see it opens - and stays - above my target. Renewing my faith. 

I’m here to encourage my other silent friends who may be in the same boat as me and want to peel off. DONT. I’ve read all of the DD. I know it’s good. Conquer your fears. 

Also - do not forget about the taxes on capital gains. Ole Uncle Sam is gonna come peel your panties off if you sell for small profits. 


Just want to thank you all here for the confirmation bias and bringing me along for the ride. I’m not here to say I’m going to do some whacky stunt or eat a horse penis. It’s a crazy and stressful and whacky ride. My wife is tired of hearing me talk about it.

**8:30 Pre-Market Update**

GME does not care that the markets have closed. While the North American Apes were sleeping, the Europan, Asian, Australian, and African Apes continue to fuel the 🚀, pushing GME's price to around 285. It has since leveled out around 277.

[Some apes are speculating that Short Interest compared to the Float may still be over 200%.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m19sa7/true_short_interest_in_gee_em_ee_could_be/) Available shorts according to [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) show that there are 850,000 shorts available. This number will be updated at around 9:04 with this morning's short activity. According to [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/), there are 45.16 million float shares. Regardless of what the actual Short% is, I feel confident to say that there are still too many shorts still outstanding and that GME's momentum should continue. Those shorts must be bought eventually, and the Apes will decide how much they will sell their 🍌🍌🍌 for.

* Shorts available: 850,000

* Price at Close: 246.90

* Current Pre-Market Price: 277.74

**9:07 Pre-Market Update**

500,000 shorts were opened premarket. This might explain why premarket prices are around 266. Don't be surprised if there is a dip at the start of the Bell.

* Shorts available: 350,000

* Current premarket price: 266.63 (corrected)

* Current price: 203.50

**Update 12:53 Halt #6**

SLINGSHOT!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

* Current price: 262.46

**Update 1:00**

GME is volatile as fuck right now. It seems to be stabalizing around 260 at the moment, but we just don't have enough data after the halt to make a good prediction on it's current trajectory. 260 would still be above where it started, so it would technically be a win for GME, though it's nowhere near the 350 it was at prior to the drop.

Mid update update

Stock is now around 240. I don't even have enough time to comment between major moves anymore. Hold on tight.

* Shorts available 200,000

* Current price: 250

I have to use the bathroom. Please forgive me if I miss another halt.

God damnit, can't I take a piss without another halt? I don't even know why we're stopped.

* Current price: 263.95

**Update 1:19**

Y'all, my lunch ends in 10 minutes. I'm going to try to keep y'all updated after lunch at the risk of getting fired. This shit is absolutely insane right now.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 258.36

**Update 1:26**

So the shorts available have not changed according to IBorrowDesk. What this means is that the SHITs are getting their shorts from somewhere else, or the 500,000 that were borrowed in pre-market were held back until the lunch attack. This way, the number on IBorrowDesk doesn't change right after the drop, so it can look like it wasn't them. I'm willing to bet money that a good portion if not all of those 500,000 shorts were used during the lunch attack.

GME is recovering from that blast and is making it's way back towards 300. We'll see if the trajectory has changed after the attack.

* Shorts available: 200,000

* Current price: 278.96

**Update 1:46**

GME had been floating around 270, however another 50,000 shorts were borrowed. This might explain the dip down to below 260. The volatility seems to have evened out enough for this to make sense. Please realize that regardless of where GME ends up today, 750,000 shorts were fired at GME today, and the price is still up 8% from yesterday's close. They are at 150,000 shorts left. They are running out of ammo and GME is still climbing. We might be reaching the end game.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 266.65

**2:20 Update**

Downward momentum lately pushing below 250. It was stable around 265 for a good bit. This might be another short attack. 

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 236.70

**3:00 Update**

GME dropped down to around 225 before starting it's slow recovery back up. This might be an attack from remnants from the shorts borrowed earlier today. We're not seeing drops in shorts available. With this post being popular, the SHITers might be onto how we gather information on their moves and are trying to mask their intentions. I'm pretty sure there is math available where we can figure out the short to price change ratio to be able to figure out how many shorts they fire during a short attack. I'm going to think on this and see if I can figure out a process to figure this out. I'm pretty sure it's doable, but probably involves some complicated math.

If we can figure out that equation, we would be able to estimate how many shorts are being pumped into GME on every attack. We can then figure out how much ammo they truly have left.

* Shorts available: 150,000

* Current price: 257.72

190,This sub has turned to complete shit. I miss the days of SPY FDs and shitty DD on a variety of companies. Now it's just a GME circle jerk full of bag holders desperately trying to convince everyone to hold in the name of some pathetic sjw political statement.
191,"I wouldn't be surprised if Melvin Capital offers him a buttload of money to exit his position just so they could get the diamond hand gang off their backs.   Whatever he does I respect the hell out of him.  He took a genius idea and turned it into absolute ""fuck you"" money.  The guy is an absolute legend and I hope he sticks around after this is all done.  We need more ballsy people with rock solid DD."
192,"Yeah this is also what I'm getting at. This sub was always about money, money, money. Nothing to do with 'saving businesses', taking down hedge funds etc. Just retarded options plays that sometimes worked out but mostly didn't and DD. 

I feel like $GME message got co-opted from 'we can get rich af bois' to this 'reddit takes on hedge funds to save struggling businesses and cure cancer!!!' which has led to the kind of cult mentality we've seen emerge on the sub in the last week.

The lack of serious politics discussion on this sub is why it's one of the best places on Reddit because everywhere else is infested with that toxic mess.

Feel like a lot of the 'eat the rich' crowd discovered WSB but don't realise that OG WSBers don't want to eat the rich, we want to be the rich

Honestly I'm scared for the future of WSB because I don't see how you can add like 6.5m new members in the space of a week and not lose the culture that made the sub legendary. I will seriously miss WSB if it never goes back to normal"
193,goddamn and to think all my research is basically read through r/wsb and hope i find good DD's that other people done for me
194,"this, lol. everyone is so united and high in morale when shit's going fine, but if/when it finally goes downhill you'll realize you're alone in this. i experienced this when everyone was so confident SPY was going down last year after controlthenarrative's DD, felt like everyone was holding each other's hands and we'd go down together if the ship sank. welp i lost everything and realized i was alone in the sunken ship, nobody was able to, or going to help. took awhile to recover, and honestly, i'm pretty damn skeptical of any ""united movement"" now lol"
195,"Many of the OGs would argue the culture was lost years ago. It had already become saturated with memes long before the GME thing. In the beginning it was mostly irreverent trading discussion, DD, and pictures of gains/losses."
196,"I miss the old WSB...  Used to be able to find good ideas in the DD threads, and now it's all this GME shit (hell, i made a fair amount of money off gme when it was 5 and 10 bucks - but I'm sure as shit not touching it now).  I hope all these new people bounce when this is over - so that good ideas start showing up again."
197,I’ve always understood what this sub was but surprisingly there is phenomenal DD on here sometimes if you dig through the nonsense. But yes it definitely has changed quadrupling in size in a week or two.
198,"Its also about posting your positions with the only DD being ""you're an asshole for not buying."""
199,"I read 14,564 and I just see massive hyper inflation and the collapse of our economy.

GME has become a giant noise machine drowning out DD"
200,I've said it before and I'll say it again: I don't subscribe to this sub for the DD or the loss/gain porn; I'm here for the fucking OC.

204,"Credit u/PlayFree_Bird

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

TIL The original word for 'bear' has been lost. People in middle ages were superstitious and thought saying the animal's name would summon it. They called it 'bear' which means 'the brown one' to avoid saying its actual name.

209,"Through the time I've been browsing WSB, I've been burned quite a few times from listening to someone's DD about a stock. But this, this right here, I believe in WSB 100%. Not even that, I believe in the people of the world 100%. Actions speak louder and people all over the globe are coming together for this. I love it. I'm so glad to be a part of this, not just because I'm making a lot of money, but for the movement of the people. Standing up for what's right.

210,"I could've sold at 460 and improved my life a bit, but I held because I have faith in the DD here and I like the stock."
211,I held cause I’m a greedy bastard. Faith in DD sounds a lot better though
212,"Exactly this. I bought in early enough that selling at $460 would’ve set me up pretty well. 

That being said, I also have faith in the DD and the squeeze. 

💎🙌 good shit retards. I’m proud of y’all"

214,Don’t forget about the bro that YOLOs the farm on your 3am Moonshot DD.
215,"I don’t know if you know this but DFV has a YT channel with all his DD and deep value thesis on GameStop dating back a year or so. The evidence that he’s not pumped and dumped or done anything illegitimate is all over the public domain. I’m pretty sure he’s safe. Any one of those videos (with lots of views may I add) proves he’s not done anything illegal other than invested long on a stock that he believes has value and it’s paid off big for him.

Edit: he likes the stock

Edit 2: didn’t expect this comment to blow up! For everyone asking his YouTube name is Roaring kitty"
216,"Truth be told I hope they don't bankrupt him in fees and shit. I mean he evaluated the stock and found discrepancies in it while doing his DD. It's not his fault hedge funds were shorting it over 140%. It's not his fault we live in the age of technology and he had a YouTube channel where he discusses stocks and shit like that. He breaks down his thoughts and says it's just that; his thoughts and feeling sfor the stock. I mean he did good not going to lie. He took a lot of time researching and putting it together. If they're going to say he's manipulating the market along with us then the hedge funds, politicians, ect need to not be able to talk about stocks either. They can technically influence the market with their followings and run a pump and dump. I'm sure it's been done numerous times and is still being done. So if they go after him they need to go after everyone then. Fuck the deep pockets. Theyll realize sooner or later the extent of what's actually at play with it."
217,"exactly and if it is illegal for someone to put DD on youtube well, CNBC should be the first to go."
218,"Wholesome! The man deserves our praises and support. How can exchanging DD and opinions on a public message board be construed as manipulation - while MM's and Clearing Houses are pulling some shady stuff is beyond my understanding. If they want to investigate, fine, but investigate the whole lot of degenerates that are part of this saga."
219,"What if a non US resident comes up with the next non financial advise analysis on youtube for a stock which is highly undervalued and (insert the actual DD here, I´m too retarted to know this stuff, I just like the stock and got me some sweet gamestop shopping gifts the last week)?

Can they get those guys on congress too? Asking for a friend."
220,"They will ask him things, he will explain his tought process, which is extremely well documented on youtube. The youtube videos on itself are more than enough proof he actually DID his DD better then the so called pro's. And then his thesis about gamestock started becoming more and more legendary and it was out of his hands from thereon out.. He didn't fuel the fire so to speak, he didn't manipulate the market. He was invested in gamestock before anyone ever knew."
221,...or he believes in his own DD that the squeeze has yet to come?
222,He's got over a year of DD on it and did nothing but post his positions.
223,"If they really were to throw DFV in jail like you're implying, they would need real solid fucking evidence for it, and if you look at his profile there are legit just daily updates. He's not telling anyone to buy, or hold, or sell, he's started this by himself for himself even when people were telling him that his DD is stupid. 

And even if, absurdly, the 1% make a bunch of shit up and attempt to throw him in jail - they are exactly that. The 1%. A minority. They might have the financial numbers but we have the people number, and they won't just be pissing off Americans, they'll be pissing off the entire world. They can't afford to pull something as fucked up as this in the public eye considering how many people are watching."
224,"LOL can't believe you pinned down his logic, this is true DD"
225,"Stop posting shit like this please, DD and options porn, and dank fucking memes only."
226,This is the DD we come here for
227,"This. 

[Watch his actual interview.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=On4g1uj71zc)


10 minutes of you retards' life. You already have your life savings in, what's 10 minutes?

Basically he says this:

* He thinks it's cool
* He doesn't really want to get in at this price
* Trying to actually take profit during the moment of the squeeze will be like catching a falling knife, so be careful
* If you're in profits, you may want to take out your initial investment and 'just play with the house's money'
* Only put in what you can afford to lose
* These profits wont last forever. Dont quit your day job

Overall, I dont really see what's so negative.

**ALL HE SAID WAS TO BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY AND DONT GET CAUGHT BAG HOLDING. WHICH TO MANY OF YOU KOOLADE DRINKING RETARDS SOUNDS LIKE ABSOLUTE FUD**

While im here: please stop attacking all the other DD's and saying ""we need to focus on GME!"" - fuck off. Not everyone who suggests that there might be a play other than GME that currently exists is a shill."
228,"Once you get past the vulgarness, you start to see that this is one of the most wholesome communities. Everyone is trying to make money and we're all helping each other out to do so, whether it's great DD, memes, or confirmation bias."
229,"Exactly. ""The fundamentals are a bunch of funds made a secret bet that can't possibly be true, and when exposed a lot of 'people' shared the DD and decided to go all in on proving them wrong."" (You can't sell more of something than actually exists)

Once the original betters got 🧻👐 and asked for their bail out money to close out their short positions, a load more saw the pile of burning money and thought it would go out soon, so added their shorts to it, not expecting the 💎👐 to be so strong or the 🚀 so powerful. What can I say? We like the stock."
230,"For real, I was initially pretty sure it would be fine when we had a sudden surge to 2 mil, 2.1 mil, as newcomers were still the minority. 

Now you have about 28% of the sub who even know what gourd futures are, 28% who have ever gone Guh as their calls go from a twenty bagger to zilch. The era of good DD beyond “this is short!” Or “pump this!” is likely gone. The LEAP plays are gone. 

Loss and gain porn is replaced with rage against the machine. WSBGod? RH infinite glitch? Weed stock fails? Idk if it’ll ever be possible again. I really don’t think it’ll be possible to laugh at someone’s terrible positions and DD, because so many people here have not only haven’t been on WSB for any longer than since Tuesday, but this is their first time investing at all. As a result, all the blatantly retarded posts and astroturfing will be jumped on as a bandwagon. Good DD will see a pump in the price of a stock, and a dump when it doesn’t immediately materialise. 

Subs grow, they mods want the sub to grow of course, but it’s now also only a matter of time before we’re called ableist homophobes and 🏳️‍🌈🐻, retard, and autist get banned. 

I wrote a post earlier in the week saying that the influx of attention was bad, but would ultimately fade and things would return to normality. We could absorb 400k noobs. Now, we are by far the minority. It’s a new chapter, but I don’t really wanna be here for it."
231,Whats DD
232,"Right, so why is everyone yelling with frenzy about NOK and giving it 🚀🚀? It's a long position with hopefully growth.  Nothing is mooning with NOK. Is this wrong?

And also, AMC is no where near as deep in the squeeze as GME. 63% shorted and possible to be covered by the hedges. 

I don't really know what is going on - this is my first purely speculative trade and based on chatter from all directions. Like a giant REGARD I have done no DD. Might as well only hold and wait. Argh"
233,"It IS. it takes a little time to read all the documentation. But I opened a Robin Hood account the night before they did their bullshit, and a TDA account the next day. 

I put my $50 in TDA, which was easy.

The one thing I did to protect myself from potentially fucking up BIG is I set my account up without the ability to do margin or options trading. So I can only buy stock I have the money in the account to buy. The worst that could happen is I could lose what I put in. 

Like I said, I put in $50 from my 'allowance' account, which means I'm almost literally being cheeseburgers and videogames for money.

Then, do your DD (I'm preeeeeetty sure that's Due Diligence which means make your own choices because no one here is offering investment advice), select a stock, and buy it. 

I bought my BB as a Limit purchase @$15 last night, which meant I wouldn't spend more than $15 for it. This morning when I woke up, it still hasn't purchased. It has since dipped below $15, which means I not only bought (automatically) but have technically lost money. Now I get to join the 💎 ✋ crew. 

I'm doing my part!"
234,"Wait....EB Games is Gamestop!?!?!? That is...incredible. Thank you for opening my eyes. Clearly I did my DD like the rest of us.  


EDIT: I have a story about EB Games. I bought a Steam GC off them for my sister for Christmas, immediately lost it, you know cause I'm a retard. I emailed EB games and asked for help, and the motherfuckers looked up the GC PIN for me and I got all my damn money back!! This happened last week. The fact that they are owned by Gamestop is just the icing on the cake here."
235,"I bought more shares today, and if the prices will drop more I will buy more if I can afford. 
Nothing changed, the big boys are only trying to keep the money for themselves: you thought they would have give up so easily?
All the DD I read in the last 2 weeks convinced me, and I like the stock, otherwise I would never have bought it in the first place.
🚀"
236,"Not my post, mods dont remove me, I just love this stock x post

Shorts doubled down on GME and AMC short positions. FINRA just published today’s data http://regsho.finra.org/regsho-Index.html 


AMC short interest on 2/1: 76,933,491 

AMC short interest on 2/2: 129,244,517 

An increase of: 52,311,026


GME short 2/1: 6,982,444 

GME short 2/2: 16,358,444

An increase of: 9,375,692 

So, if we can bring GME and AMC above yesterday’s price levels, then the new shorts will start feeling the pressure. The squeeze opportunity is still here. 

They are doubling down on their positions. 

HOLD FOR 🚀 🦍+🦍=💪

I’m not a financial advisor. This is for entertainment purposes only.

Edit: I’m seeing a lot of old data regarding short interest, and “DD” posts being upvoted talking about how shorts only have ____ days to cover. Please Stop 🛑 

Instead, share the data from FINRA (link above) in relevant posts on WSB... I don’t have enough Karma and my posts keep getting deleted."
237,"Mass hysteria... This is what it is like to join a cult. There is no way you can stick it to Wall Street when you have no funds to make the next play. Also, never brag about money that wasn't cashed out. It's always funny money on the ride up, and then loss porn on the ride down. I'm loving how smooth brained this sub became and how real DD and advice is being down voted because it goes against this new cult. It's like, who can take the biggest red dildo in the ass and not flinch! That will sure show the world we've learned to trade!"
238,"Even with GME @ $140 and AMC @ $8, I'm still up 35% since July 2020 from meme stonks. Some of the DD here is legit and were volatile picks which I wouldn't have otherwise noticed - the 🚀🚀🚀are real - you just have to sift the 💎💎💎 diamonds from the 💩💩💩

💎💎💎👐"
239,"I graphed these yesterday against price action for the last 10 years..

Check out real time transactions here: [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/latest-real-time-trades)

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders"" (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another?

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

**Before you decide to sell your stonks at a loss because you got 📃 👐 , or if you're doubting the great DD that some of the folks on this side of history have done, HAVE A READ:**

[Anatomy of the short attack.](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp;amp;amp;amp_gsa=1&amp;amp;amp;usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D#aoh=16119453107704&amp;amp;amp;referrer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com&amp;amp;amp;amp_tf=From%20%251%24s&amp;amp;amp;ampshare=https%3A%2F%2Fseekingalpha.com%2Finstablog%2F11442671-gerald-klein%2F3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack)

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

[What does counterfeit stock mean?](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

**Need more proof?**

Jim Cramer himself, [""here's what short sellers do, it's illegal but when you have 6 days to get out and you're down you need to foment and wipe that guy out quickly"".](https://youtu.be/VMuEis3byY4)

**This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube. (THANKS for this info,** [/u/blancochocolate](https://www.reddit.com/u/blancochocolate/)**)**

* Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

Investopedia \[""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic \]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

>20210111|403775109|GMEV|**50604630**|GME INNOTAINMENT INC COM STK (|.

A quick scan of this list shows many tickers with fails to deliver in the hundreds of thousands or higher. How do we know this value is actually a good indicator of counterfeit share short attacks and this isn't just confirmation bias?

For the record I'm still holding my GME, but I just don't know how legitimate this DD is. Can someone clarify?"
242,A gentleman of jupyter distinction. Make this a seperate DD post! Might have to ping mods to get it unblocked
243,"I have my main account with the local credit union and a checking account with BofA. Per the requirements, I have my employer DD $250 every pay period to keep the account ""free"". While the credit union has much better rates, I find BofA better in terms of technical functionality, mobile app/check deposit, access to customer service, bank presence, cash back options/BankAmerideals, and nationwide ATMs when I am traveling. It's like people want access to top of the line, state of the art, convenient mobile AND branch banking without investment. I find the requirements for their basic accounts ($250 DD for checking, $500 minimum for savings) quite reasonable compared to other big banks."
244,"I have the account too and I got several notices and a huge popup that blocked the website for me until I closed it and popped up every time I went to the website until I clicked do not show again that said ""WE WILL START CHARGING A FEE ON MM/DD/2017 FOR NOT HAVING ENOUGH MONEY IN SAVINGS.  HERE'S HOW TO TRANSFER MONEY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH AND HERE IS HOW YOU CLOSE THE ACCOUNT""  "
245,"You’ve overlooked 1 incredibly important detail that will blow this entire DD up.

ELON MUSK IS SOUTH AFRICAN"
246,"\[Disclosure: I am a South African\]

As a long time observer of South African politics, I can't fault you for being pessimistic on South Africa' prospects. 

I do think SA has a tendency to canter from crisis to crisis, always perennially on the verge of blowing up, but never quite getting there; kind of like the alcoholic who can never quit the bottle and turn his life around, but also keeps drinking long past what you'd think is plausible for any human being. Consequently, making any short term (2 - 5 year) bets on the country seems hard; maybe the economy blows up, or maybe the end of Covid19 sees a commodities boom that boosts the rand. Maybe Cyril cleans up a bit, or maybe DD Mabuza unseats him at the next party conference. Maybe Ace is President one day, maybe he gets shuffled out.

Personally I'd put SA down as a perennial underperformer, but never a complete disaster; whether that gets reflected in any specific numbers, currencies or indices is something I just don't know enough about stocks to be able to say."
247,"Let me put in this way; currency fell. They sold reserves. Then it fell even further; they worked out with some swaps.

Currently; central bank has -$50BN reserves on net. Although they do a few make ups on the balance sheet like not showing up the swaps’ liabilities.

Also; paying 15-ish% interest rate. Currently they gained value but all of it came from hot money. The moment it gets away; (taking the interest and initial investment) then there isn’t enough reserves to cover.

Plus; unemployment got shrinked. I guess I need to make a proper DD for showing to everyone."
248,"Awesome DD!

I'm also really starting to believe that there just aren't enough shares available to cover the shorts. The bid ask spread has been around 0.20 which is quite wide considering the tens of millions in volume. Stocks trading with that much volume shouldn't have more than 0.02 difference between bid and ask. The only thing I can know for sure is that there will be more volatility, up and down alike."
249,This should be on the front page. We finally have great DD again which will improve morale 🤲💎
250,"Excellent DD, although I can not read.

&#x200B;

btw what's up with that selling/ buying 100 shares at marketprice. Does anybody have some explanation for dummys?"
251,Great work man! Thank you for this! THIS is the kind of DD I subbed for!
252,Just saw the comments and confirmed this DD is worth of pretending to read it
253,"Sounds like solid DD, but this is the 2nd post I’ve seen today where OP only has one post in history.   That weird."
254,"Non-believers, you either drop a counter DD with the same amount of detail or stfu."
255,"Great fucking read OP! Thanks a lot for bringing us back to the pre ""meme"" ium days when DD was solid! Cheers!"
256,"Okay that was last week though, what happened this week? Volume was large everyday and the stock continuously nosedived until today when it jumped for a millisecond then crashed again. I mean I want to believe and I'm holding regardless but I just want to know if any one has any clue. Who's to say they didn't buy put options then cash out when it declined and covered their short positions? This is beautiful DD but it's missing this whole week"
257,Thank you for the DD !! Good shit!!
258,"Thank you for good DD! Good DD is what this community thrives on, along with loss porn, but mostly good DD."
259,"Thank you for your efforts into this DD, I also own the stock so appreciate this information to compare with other information"

265,DD stands for “Due Diligence” my friends
266,"Ihor from S3 has spoken about how they report the S3 version of SI % since November:  
[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1323324645400076288?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1323324645400076288?s=20)

Furthermore, he's reported both traditional and S3 version of SI % for GME since then as well (most likely earlier, I didn't scroll back much further):  
[https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1323309246423928835?s=20](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1323309246423928835?s=20)  


I believe all the DD thus far only ever used the traditional SI% interest, until GME started gaining popularity, at which point people started following S3 because they algorithmically predict traditional SI % and S3 SI % daily, so people started relying on these numbers since the true SI data is only released twice a month with a two-week lag. Sometime during this chaos of last week, people mistook the S3 SI % instead of the traditional one.  


This might be explained by  the fact that on Jan 29th, traditional SI was at 113% while S3 SI was at 53%.   
The Monday update showed that the traditional SI % was now at 53%, while the S3 SI was at 34%.   
Since the Friday S3 version happened to end up as the same as the traditional SI version after the decrease in shorts, somewhere along the way people thought the numbers had been fudged when really, they just misread it.

267,great DD
268,"The post was a literal copy & paste from the CNBC youtube video that was uploaded a few days ago. There was nothing original about the DD and was most likely a guy trying to pump NIO

EDIT: people are asking for the video: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS8\_v6K2\_Gg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS8_v6K2_Gg)"
269,"It’s the fucking internet dude. Anyone can lie. My wife’s boyfriend tells people he’s a minority female with a Ph.D in one post, then he’s a retired Army Sgt in another...he’s really just a slacker with no job, no life who only enjoys boning my wife. It’s the internet, lies are everywhere...you better have a good filter and rely on your own DD."
270,Now mods have standards for DD? LMAO
271,"So...if true the ccp is retarded enough to write out a lengthy DD from a user with no post history, when the majority of autists here don’t even need propaganda to go all in on NIO anyways? Fuck me, the ccp really does belong in this sub! Welcome comrades."
272,It's not like this sub can tell difference between someone pumping and actual DD anyways
273,"So everytime a person posts DD or ""BUY XXX TOO THE MOON"" company, should we also say this is US government officials trying to make /wsb buy TSLA, PLTR, GME?


If I had a dollar for every unoriginal TSLA, PLTR, GME post on here, telling me to buy it, i could buy 1 stock of each, every week"
274,"This is some funny shit. He just wants to share his DD because as Chinese, and talking about a Chinese company, he has some language advantages that you regular English-only retards can't overcome. LMAO nobody is forcing you to long NIO."
275,"Gay mods are ok with shilling shitty stocks like palantir, MT, Vale, GME for months but when someone post good DD about NIO, the user got banned and post deleted. Mods should be sued for a lot of these shitty stock bankrupting retards in this page. Racists piece of shits."
276,"I saw a lot of what he said reported by cnbc before he did his DD so he seemed pretty credible

https://youtu.be/IS8_v6K2_Gg"
277,"Idk man he made some pretty solid DD, just cuz it’s from China doesn’t make him public enemy #1 to WSB. Might need to simmer down the radical nationalist Americano bigotry talk"
278,So literally just a Chinese guy posting a DD is a professional government plot from the CCP...?
279,"You can have my upvote. Everyone should take all chinese DD with a grain of salt, especially since pooh bear is pulling the strings anyway"
280,"Hertz, lumber liquidators, nikola, virgin galactic, palantir, gamestop, almost every DD here, and now you draw the line?

You plain stupid dude"
281,"This sub is pretty much 99% ""DD"" or meme pump posts and 1% ""I'm so smart, I gained a fuck ton (this time)"" or ""Lol I lost like 300k nbd"". It's not even worth the effort to get angry over any one post. The amount of pumping on PLTR, GME, TSLA, NIO of course, and others in recent months has made me rarely look at posts other than daily discussion, and even then in those it's like 90% rocket ship pump comments."
282,And yet it was still the best DD we've ever seen here.
283,Bad choice of tactics trying to appeal to us with sound DD. Should've gone for a meme pump in stead
284,"This is why I don't give a shit about DD, packaged propaganda, etc. I day trade full time, and will trade anything up or down. I don't give two hairy shits about the stock, the company, their values. All I want to see is movement. Long or short that bitch, close position two minutes later and walk away with my cash.

I do that 2-3 times per day, and walk away. That's the game for me. I've been in this game since mid - 2019, and I'm ok with it.

Edit : Am I trying to be an overnight millionaire? Hell no! I'm paying bills and building funds. But, I'm also not going to be overnight homeless either. I do this shit for a living."
285,"No different than most of the DD that happens around here:

- parrots information that’s been around for years

- sprinkles in a few “retards” and “autists”

- thousands of upvotes. OP pumps his calls. Makes extra $200

By “propaganda” logic this sub should have a Tesla logo anyway"
286,"Wait, now your judging the quality of other people's DD?!? and accusing them of pumping?!?? wtf is going on."
287,"Either way, every NIO DD should have to include a photo of Winnie the Pooh. This will help us filter."
288,"100%

DD is impossible when a totalitarian state permits cooking the books and manipulates their currency for national pride. You have absolutely no way of knowing if any of the numbers for any Chinese firm are real so it's blind gambling. NIO is the next Luckin."
289,"I know this sub is full of retards, but I didn't know they were this unironically retarded. 30k+ upvotes because this sub is supposedly  being ""iNfiLtRaTeD bY ChInEsE sPiEs!"" ???

Like come the fuck on. It's like if somebody posted a memey DD about an American company and EVERYBODY dog-piles on the OP and asks them about ""tens of millions of civilians killed by the US in the Middle East"" or some shit like that and OP replies ""it's not actually *that* many"" and gets banned for it.

Might as well ban every single discussion on Chinese companies."
290,"MIL doing the DD.

Nice."
291,For all things China she is my DD
292,"Of all the shit that goes on here, you think THIS needs to be called out as dangerous?

People legitimately bet their life savings here on short dated options based on less reliable DD or flat out memes."
293,"That's dangerous?
 
This entire sub is based around win/loss porn and DD propaganda to influence poor fucking retarded yeeyee ass suckers into pumping your stock because they don't know how to form their own opinions or do their own research.
 
Who the fuck cares where/whom the propaganda is coming from, retards will eat that shit up and the stock will 🚀🚀🚀
 
We're here not to play the stocks, but to play the misinformed and gullible for a profit"
294,That’s also because of the amount of absolute retards who follow DD blindly
295,"DD posts on r/wallstreetbets

Blind leading the blind."
296,I think a majority of this sub is here because they see the gain posts and they just want to throw money in at copying the same thing. It’s how my retarded ass started anyways. It wasn’t until I started getting fucked by following some of the advice that I started doing my own DD
297,To be fair my own DD fucks me too
298,Then just do DD and then do the inverse of whatever you come to. You can’t lose
299,"I would ask Mark about all the illegal activities that have been coming from these hedges. A lot of you autistic have been doing a great job with DD on the matters. Furthermore, I would find out exactly how we can all coordinate together to report these mf's to see them burn. We have been winning this, 1000%. They have been cheating every which way possible. I don't want to be here in two months talking about how we just put up a ""good fight"" and that we ""gavevthen a run for their money"". I want to be talking about how we TOOK DOWN these bastards. 

TL;DR - Let's take advantage of this AMA and ask Mark to clarify some of the blatant market manipulation everybody has been poiting out and what else we can do to come together and take these fuckers down aside from just buying and holding. 🦧💪"
300,I was waiting for some actual DD. Thank you.
301,"DD flair, lmao"
302,Best DD so far !
303,DD checks out.
304,Finally some quality fucking DD around here!
305,The DD to rule them all
306,this is the kind of DD that makes me stay in the game
307,This is the kind of DD that we've been lacking on this sub
308,"I’m still holding my 6 shares, maybe I’ll buy one more.
Solid DD bro."
309,THIS is what i call some classic wallstreetbets DD. Literally CANNOT go tits up.
310,This is gonna revolutionize DD
311,This is the DD that makes WSB what it is. Ya’ll new people come in here with your fancy terms like fully semiautomatic short ladder assault and think you’re going to get heard. Triangles mean rockets. Done. Instinctively I hold and buy more.
312,God I hate that this type of DD gets 100% more retards to buy the stock 🤣
313,Lots of haters in WSB all of a sudden....weird no? All I see is some fucking awesome DD. TO THE MOON!!!
314,"https://youtu.be/PmDYrMGKMQM

Watch this guys channel and find the first video in is series. Don’t expect me to try and find it because I’m high and I can’t be bothered.

Then try to find the DD (due diligence) tag in r/wallstreetbets and read stuff there.

And call your mother, she’s worried about you"
315,It was such a dumb question to ask he could have sold at a profit if 50 million but didn't he executed his calls and left the rest to ride he was happy when it was sat at $20 a share because he was confident in the company doing well and if after all this it settles again at $20-40 he'll stay holding. He is confident in his DD
316,"Sounded like every DD post made in the last few weeks.  Son of a bitch, I'm in."
317,"This can explain with simple elementary science. If his phone is fully charged that means he’s not on WSB or staring at this portfolio long enough. Only those who’s on WSB 24/7 and watching their portfolio from 8am - 8pm are the ones that needs to charge their phones with the best charging cable and adapter one can buy with all their gains. OP obviously just goes to WSB, do a quick scroll, find the first DD with lots of rockets and emojis and go ALL IN, then goes back to doing his only things."
318,"I've been here for a long time and I hate what the gme fiasco did to this place. I don't find it nearly as fun anymore. And there was genuinely good DD and interesting info shared. Now every post is about the squeeze and some meme stock. It's all a few people hyping a stock, getting rich, selling while posting to HOLD THE LINE while everyone else goes broke holding the bag. 

I've seen people here with over a 1000% gain not selling. 

This place went from fun retarded to retarded retarded"
319,WSB used to be a consistently great alternative tool for good DD. its still good but now you have to sort through way too much noise
320,"Actually a problem for the long-term suitability of the sub. So far the few stocks pushed recently look a LOT like a pump and dump. WSB had serious issues in Jan about getting shut down (remember the discord fiasco and WSB going down for a bit?). I'm a new ape, but through all the shit flinging I've learned so much in such a short time thanks to so many dedicated apes. Despite that, the rhetoric now is eerily like after Jan where if enough stocks make it to the front page and look like pump and dumps the power that be will come down on us. That really almost happened once. As for the good old days, communities evolve and adapt to new members (there should be a turnover) to stay alive. Here I feel it's attracted a unique scattering of personalities and with that comes conflict. Now mix in some FUD and that's where we are now. My biggest concern are people getting swept up in any of this without DD. They will be the loudest proponents against this sub instead of celebrating this insane casino."
321,">walk into reddit

>drop 50 pages of disjointed ramblings and speculation mixed with tired memes and emojis

>call it ""DD""

>150k upvotes"
322,Is there a new more low key sub for the OG Wallstreet bets people or a sub where people actually post good DD?
323,"My first visit/memory was the DD from a guy that predicted the fall of some countries currency/economy but the market closed before he could short it or something.

Those were the days."
324,There is like zero DD at all here.  It's just a pumpfarm now.
325,"I mean TBF i showed up after all of that, But i want to see more of Skreli's DD or just classic loss porn"
326,"I've made more money off selling covered options on meme stocks then I have doing DD on tickers I'm interested in. Sure many of them hit and I lose out on a lot, but I'm making damn near 10% month. Off BB alone I've gained almost 15k on a 50k investment in just IV drop."
327,"Yep. Every single ""DD"" nowadays is just ""Hurr durr stonk go moon, apes together"" and never anything of value."
328,There's a fantastic [gay bear DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nw17ne/in_honor_of_pride_month_a_bold_gay_bear_dd/) that got posted today that likely won't receive the attention it deserves
329,"I'm sorry, I'm talking about the OTHER assholes.  You're good, thank you for the DD :)"
330,The glory days of the lean hog futures DD posts from 2017-2018 and the 4 great market crashes of 2019 when it was tendieman vs china trade war
331,Honestly it encouraged ACTUAL individual DD. you had to do your own DD to even understand what the fuck DD FD etc etc meant. Or just be lazy and just get a vague idea of what it means until you actually learn what it means along the way somewhere like me.

Institutional ownership for long positions account for a large percentage of shares. AH volume is super low which tells me long positions are NOT selling so why would you? Another tactic to lower moral and tarnish public sentiment. Half or more of the value of a security is perceived value.

Detach yourself from this artifical price. If you've done your DD, you know and believe in the stock and where it's headed (ANDROMEDA). Retail owns the float and controls the price shorties have to buy back at, it can go as high as retail wants as long as retail HODLs. Expect there to be fuckery with GMEs price, especially today. Expect the media to twist the earnings in favour of shorties. Expect the worst, because this is the game they are playing, this is psychological warfare.

See all the ""perfect"" orders (e.g. 100, 200, 300 shares) of nice whole numbers in the hundreds, with scattered ""imperfect orders"" (e.g. 134, 194 shares)? Notice how the nice, whole numbered orders are very predictable in pricing which varies cents off of one another?

It's a coordinated attack. Hold and chill. This isn't financial advice, just sharing something new.

**This is what the shorts are doing right now.**

**Dont feel like reading a novel? The short and dirty (TLDR AT THE FUCKING BOTTOM):**

Short Attack:

1. Sell **fake**, COUNTERFEIT stocks between hedge funds and increasingly lower ask prices to try to scare other investors into selling and/or to trigger limit sell price points. They've been doing this all week. Each major price drop has been because of this tactic.
2. Get the media to spread fear, doubt, and uncertainty. Anyone watching CNBC this week has seen this in action.
3. Spread disinformation through ""analysis"" to get people to sell their stocks because ""the fundamentals aren't there"". Again, this is all over the place right now.
4. Open class action lawsuits against the company/shareholders claiming they're artificially inflating the stock price. Haven't seen it yet, but they've definitely threatened it.
5. Get the government/SEC involved alleging the same as #4. Definitely happening.
6. Pull margin shares and sell them. As seen being done by Robinhood over the last two days.
7. Spread FUD on message boards. Hello 4 million new subs pushing AMC, BB, SLV, etc.

Basically this past week has been 9/10 of the tactics in the short attack playbook to try to either push Gamestop into bankruptcy so they can profit on their short positions or slowly gain them back when people sell their stocks.

Confused what **counterfeited stock** means? Some light reading that [/u/draemon\_](https://www.reddit.com/u/draemon_/) provided explains it perfectly but beware, you actually have to read something:

The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.\*

Investopedia \[""Short and Distort"" - illegal short tactic \]([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:\~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/analyst/030102.asp#:~:text=Short%20and%20distort%20(S%26D))

**Yet more support for the at times illegal and unethical nature of these practices: (THANK YOU,** [/u/catolicquotes](https://www.reddit.com/u/catolicquotes/)

**Pulling Margin** from long customers during a short attack serves two purposes. Obviously the flood of shares that are “forced” sales help drive the price down, which aids the short cause in general. More important, for the broker dealers who clear for their retail customers at the same time they short against them, it creates a built-in source of cheap shares from which they can cover their open short positions.

Some of the **broker dealers short against their retail customers** from their proprietary trading desks, or “prop” desks. These are trades owned by the broker dealer, and, while they are not illegal, ethical questions certainly exist. The retail customers, who may be purchasing long investments that are being pushed by the broker dealer's retail network, have no inkling that the broker is taking a large short position contrary to the retail investor's position. With the encouragement of easy margin credit, i.e. 30% equity, the retail customers load up on stock and margin debt.

**The broker dealer, in concert with other shorts, may crash the stock by flooding the board with counterfeit shares, dropping the stock price**. The broker dealers know the amount of margin debt and the price at which their retail customers get into margin trouble. They can accelerate the squeeze on their retail customers by arbitrarily increasing the equity (percentage) requirement as the price is dropping, **frequently citing “volatility”**; which is really the shorts flooding the board with counterfeit shares.

The compounding effect of a dropping price and increasing equity requirement flushes out more shares. The broker dealers sometimes will take over the account during a margin sell-off. By engaging in poor trading practices, such as heavy selling over lunch hour; concentrated “dumps” of shares; hitting the bid with market orders; and conspiring with other trading desks, **they can further plummet the value of the stock and maximize the shares they have stripped from their retail customers**.

Most of the broker dealers who have both retail customers and prop-desk trading appear to engage in these practices. Goldman, Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch have been named in suits alleging these practices. Goldman made billions shorting against the subprime mortgage industry at the same time they were selling subprime investments to their customers.

I'm not an advisor but I LOVE this STONK! 💎🙌🏻

350,"I agree with this. Long time member. This sub has slowly changed from actual DD to “hur durrr to the moon”. Yeah I bought GME. Yeah I’m holding. But if you’re throwing your life savings into it at this point, you’re going to get absolutely burned. Stay safe, don’t give away your money...

For example if GME crashes to 150 Monday, I still made massive returns. If you bought at 400, you lose 70% of your life savings. Just don’t be an idiot"
351,"When I joined this sub there was regularly more bad/troll advice than actual DD, and the reader had to figure out what was what. Good times."
352,"this is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor, and you're retarded if you're reading wsb. It's literally ideas from self described retards. 

Don't buy if you can't afford to lose it all.

Understand that this is just straight up gambling and any DD is actually the same as some guy telling you he figured out a ""system"" to beat the casino. Maybe he did and maybe he didn't, but you are certainly too retarded to know the difference, and could just as easily get played by him.
And similarly, the house always wins, so be careful.

That said, if you can afford to hold and can handle it if you literally lose all of it, then hold.

There's definitely a chance that the shorters will be forced to buy it at some point for a high price, go bankrupt, and that the government will effectively pay you out (by giving the clearing houses the rest of the cash to cover and forcing the hedge funds to pay it back with interest, not making the public foot the bill, but make the public the debt collectors on the shorters who are in debt for years trying to pay it off). And maybe even government legislation to prevent over leveraging from forming systemic risk.

Just know that you might lose it all instead to some shenanigans that I'm too retarded to understand that would let them weasle out of it. 

I'm just worried the little guys are going to get fucked harder than my wife gets fucked by her boyfriend (as is tradition). The trick is, it can't happen if no one puts themselves in a position to get fucked. If a fuck load of people can stand to each lose their small investment , then there's literally nothing to lose, and the hedgies have everything to lose. If people yolo in life savings that they can't afford to lose, then the whole thing falls apart, because they'll have paper hands. 

That said, I personally am holding the little amount I can afford to lose. 

Anyway this is not financial advice, I'm not a financial advisor, and you're retarded if you're reading wsb. It's literally ideas from self described retards."
353,"Yea I've read zero good DD in the past week since 5 millions retards joined. It's just an echo chamber of squeeze interpretations and full of people who don't even know what options are. I might not roam around here for a while tbh, and I'm not even that old just been here since COVID crash. It's a big earnings week, too, and most people probably don't even know what earnings are."
354,"mmmm... pretty sure wsb started off mostly with hurr durr and then migrated to some super legit dd by many folks, but still with a lot of hurr durr sprinkled in there. Well, more hurr durr with super legit dd sprinkled in there. Now, it is a lot of hurr durr because that is the foundation of this entire subreddit. 

That said, you can get DD here that you could never get in /r/investing or /r/stocks. And what we see here how is no different than when yahoo forums or investorhub used to (I presume they still do) when they got a boner for some stock movement. 

I mean, I get what you are saying, but this is the actual culture that this sub created, but DD isn't sexy.... so you get mostly hurr durr because people want to be a part of this thing. Well, and of course, they (I) like the stock. 

I jumped in pretty late and I could be a bagholder. S'ok. I also would never advise someone to take out loans or bet the farm on any individual stock. During normal times, I am more of a /r/investor guy who is /r/wsb curious. Now, however, I am loving this. It is history and I have ringside seats.

I can't help but chuckle at wallstreetbets gatekeeping hipsterizing itself like this. This has been the dank meme stonk subreddit since forever and now you gon' hate it?

EDIT: 💎🤲"
355,">This sub has slowly changed from actual DD to “hur durrr to the moon

Ironically, that is the single best reason why this might actually work. People are investing irrationally without concern for fundamentals and that is the perfect strategy to counter the shorts manipulations.

You can't manipulate someone that can't read and doesn't give a fuck with words 💎🤲"

On this point. The guy who has a “system” at the casino is always full of shit. The few things you used to be able to do now have measures in place to prevent people from doing them.

Sincerely, some rando with a math degree who analyzed casino games for fun and has run simulations to check vs the theoretical. In a real casino the pay-tables and the probabilities make it certain the house wins over time.

P.S. If the term “expected value” in prob/stats means nothing to you, you can’t even figure out at how you’ll lose money over time based on pay tables alone in an *actual* casino. This shit going on right now is less predictable in many respects."
357,"I don't think its that DD isn't sexy, I think it's that a lot of people are 100% down with mob mentality and don't care to take a step back and question and research if what they're doing is a ""good"" idea"
358,"Yeah, there doesn’t seem to be any actual DD rn."
359,"Also keep in mind this sub does have a tendency of running off good DD if it doesn't pan out exactly.

I feel bad for DFV dude basically cannot talk about new trades without a bunch of people down his neck if it goes tits up."
360,I went on here the other day and the top 10 posts in rising were screenshots of an AOC tweet. I just want interesting DD damn it
361,This subreddit is actually a great place to read solid DD and gain momentum in actual undervalued stocks. I just don’t want all these people coming from Twitter to ruin a good thing. I mean 99% of the threads are about GameStop. Meanwhile the big moves will be found while everyone is distracted by this.
362,"you’re not being rude my brother; i completely agree with you. i meant that in terms of overall knowledge of things like greeks, technicals, etc. being a CFA puts them in the 1% of true knowledge. but just because someone has that knowledge doesn’t mean they’ll trade stocks or derivatives better than someone without that knowledge.

the smartest people in this sub can separate the bs from true DD and that’s really where success comes from"
363,"They will take their ball and go home or become one with the subreddit... the fear of normies is totally overhyped IMO.

I am more afraid we are going to be fed a bunch of DD posts from some hedge fund interns now. Hopefully we can use culture and language to identify the fake retard."
364,"As a former lurker and noob, love the DD and advice this group does. Getting addicted to the emojis and everything else. 🦍"
365,"I was really looking forward to memeing up the roblox IPO in the DD threads, but this occupy wsb crowd will actually follow through, become newly baptized bagholders and the screeching will never end and suck the fun out of everything"
366,"What's the saying? 

The best way to become a millionaire is to convince a billionaire to possibly engage in allegedly (not confirmed, seriously) illegal activity to profit and possibly manipulate a business into bankruptcy by shorting 100+% of a stock only to get found using entirely PUBLIC DATA and then engage in individual DD to invest."
367,I certainly haven't. Got in before the upcoming earnings report due to my own DD. Hope it pays off
368,I thought this was real DD at first cause I'm a little dumb. Then realized it absolutely is and pulled out a loan to go buy more gme tommorow!

383,"This is where the sub has fundamentally changed in the last year or two. It used to be autists who actually knew *a bit* about trading making ridiculous bets that actually had some merit, and gambling on it. Now it is just a bunch of lemmings following whatever. 

u/DeepFuckingValue had a valid bet to make and it was good one. People followed him, it has worked out so far, but what happens next time someone makes a convincing looking DD post but they are entirely wrong? People are going to join in thinking it's GME round two and they're going to get absolutely fucked because they have no idea what they're doing. When the legendary GUH happened people weren't memeing because something unexpected happened, we were memeing because people had enough market sense to know that u/ControlTheNarrative was in a retarded position and doing really a stupid thing with the infinite money glitch.

People need to bail on this before they get caught holding the bag. People keep talking about how the sub is ""Sticking it to the hedge funds"". Sure, Melvin is losing cash, but like a couple billion. This is a lot to us but to the market as a whole this is nothing, the current market value is over 50 TRILLION. You aren't fucking over the market, this is chump change, and most large funds (the ones you all despise the most) aren't wasting their time fucking around with Gamestop. The market works quite simply, it transfers wealth from one account to another. You're all hoping that the transfer if from Melvin to you, it won't be, it will be from half of you to the other half, and the half that gets out sooner is the half that's going to come out on top."

387,"Exactly, I asked a question similar to this in the DD saying “how do we know they didn’t take advantage of the lockouts and price drop to close their short positions? I mean these are career traders with a lot of resources and capital” and I got a bunch of people saying I worked at Wall Street or that it’s in the volume. I’m not saying they’re completely out of the woods and still have a high percentage of shorts but how do we know we’re not walking into a trap? They know our plan, buy and hold, why are we so certain we know theirs? 

I just sold my QQQ positions to be a part of the meme and movement. However, I still have my other work horse securities that are the bulk of my portfolio to fall on in case things go sour."

*This is not financial advice. Do your own DD. Good luck out there.*"
389,"Has anyone ever seen a message that shorts have covered that they believe?

Think about it.  If they are telling you they covered why are they telling yiu?

 it’s rare to hear someone say they covered except 
1) when a hedge fund is about to blow up and the reason is to stem withdrawals or 
2) they are trying to mislead you because they can’t cover or 
3) both.  Usually it’s 3.  So don’t believe them.  

If they do actually cover why would they tell you?  They don’t care.  They are out. 

So fact is we never know if shorts covered.  The data is wrong.  It can be masked. GME DD covers this in detail.  

Therefore if you say I’m not selling until they cover then you are probably only trying to trick yourself. 

Just a reality check"

That's not a very nice analogy, WSB actually helps animals it doesn't beat them in a corner but you get the point.

Retards like us who just love it and buy shares and calls when possible. While we wait for a squeeze we could just wake up 6-12 months from now with GME trading at 1k+ going squeeze yet?

397,"Did you ever hear the Tragedy of Darth Plotkin the short seller? I thought not. It's not a story the media would tell you. It's a 🚀reddit legend. Darth Plotkin was a 🌑Dark Lord of the hedge fund Melvin Capital, so powerful and so wise he could use borrowed stonks 💰 to influence the market and force companies into bankruptcy... He had such a knowledge of short selling that he could create new shares by naked shorting. Hedge funds are a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful...the only thing he was afraid of were 🦍, which eventually, of course, came after him and his friends. Unfortunately, the 🦍 had 💎 🧤 and shared decent DD. It's ironic he could make retail investors rich, but not the hedge funds."

402,This is the best GME post since DFV's original DD
403,"/u/smohyee  Found something that appears to be evidence for argument 5.

/u/embarrassed-ice-2971 made a [new DD post about Today's position distribution chart.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lbc5gq/gmes_data_irregularities/) 

This chart indicates that shares were added to the float but none of the previous shares had moved. Basically

> 1. It looks like all the shares that were traded today were new and added to the float!
2. People actually seem to be diamond handing!"
404,"Finally, some serious DD that is much more than simply ""HOLD"" and ""If DFV is in, I'm in.""

I'm a retard so I'm still holding on to 10 shares of GME at $350. That's my next month's rent that I'm prepared to not get back. Will have to go suck some you know what behind the 7-11 to tie me through the next few weeks. 

But seriously, my biggest question is this. The stock went from $40 to $483 in 5 trading session with the biggest jump, $76 to $483 in 2 sessions. And that $40 is already up from $4 back in August. That is a stock that went 100x in less than 6 months. 

People comparing to VW, it took a year of build up to squeeze that stock price from ~100 euro to 1000 euro at the peak. That was 10x. And VW was a better run company with actual IP, brand, and value, relative to its peers than GME (brick and mortar retailer trying to transition to e-commerce) currently. 

So we have already seen a 10x larger price jump in half of the time compared to VW. 

So why do people keep saying that the short squeeze hasn't happened yet?"
405,"Does anyone have any idea where the “Reddit lives silver” bullshit came from?  I’m on here almost 6 hours a day, and aside from the original DD I didn’t hear a peep about silver until asian markets opened and it exploded in price.  Even Zero Hedge was like “drop GME get silver”. It was so quick and coordinated with minimal DD"
406,"What the fuck is this? r/stocks?

Just show me a 🚀

In all seriousness, good DD though. Enjoyed it."
407,"Holy shit, some actual fucking DD for once in the last 3 weeks. 

Thank you OP for bringing the old WSB back, it’s truly refreshing and comforting to know that deep down in this echo chamber the old voice still exists. 

Whatever happens to GME, I honestly don’t care anymore, I just want THIS old WSB back. Actual, earnest, and open sharing of ideas. 

Be well OP, may tendies rain down upon you."
408,Can we get some discussion on[this DD post here regarding extreme high naked shorts? ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lb8hjc/datadriven_dd_i_analyzed_265000_rows_of_sec_short/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) there seems to be some good points and would love to get this added as argument #7
409,"Hijacking top comment to share what another Redditor put together:

[wherearetheshares.com](https://wherearetheshares.com) \- contains some good thought provoking content and a wonderful little 2006 youtube video that's been spliced together talking about FTDs.

u/smohyee thank you for an excellent DD. I was long at \~$13 and sold @ $35, held one share for the ride. No idea on the current status of the squeeze but believe it's likely over (prematurely killed by DTCC changing requirements).

What I can say is that I have learned a TON about market mechanics over the last 50 days and am very thankful for such a wonderful experience.

For those holding in the mid hundreds, godspeed and goodluck, I hope for your sake that the squeeze has not squozed."
410,"U/zjz is it possible to add a “Braindump” flair?  Could help people find actual DD and Discusions.  As always, my love for you is real.  Let me know if your wife’s boyfriend needs to be fluffed, I know you’ve been super busy"
411,"Well said. The potential of a short squeeze was always secondary to DFV's DD, so I think the worshipping of his daily post as ""hE's StiLL iN"" misses the point. He A) got in at a price that leaves plenty of room for profit on fundamentals alone and B) already took quite some profit on the existing spike (that $13.7 mln cash in his account didn't come from nowhere). I would honestly bet he's ignoring the stock altogether until it reverts to fundamentals and his original DD comes back into play."
412,"Yep, the links in the first comment I posted to the DD post made by  /u/meta-cognizant

414,"Let them think we don’t know what we’re doing. Let them think GME was a randomly selected stock that we don’t really understand. Let them think there aren’t pages and pages of DD that shows that the formerly prevailing consensus of the business is based on lazy assumptions and only a superficial understanding of the company. Let them think we don’t make our own decisions. Let them keep underestimating retail investors that share information and play them at their own game. 

Their failure to understand that the strength of this forum is in the exchange of ideas (and memes) rather than supposed “co-ordination” will be the reason they get caught unawares again, once the dust settles."
415,Adding more GME shares to position on Monday cuz you said it would get me respect. If only I could get my exes boyfriends respect. DD that for me.

Everyday, Jim Cramer, Lightning Round, All in All!

I let the DD talk, til my brain pop!

Vaping ejuice, reading up on prior stocks!

Way back, when I had way OTM SPY puts, with the Vix calls to match. 

Remember /u/ControlTheNarrative ? *gUh, GuH, GUH* !

You never thought WSB would take it this far!

Now we’re in the limelight, cuz our DD’s tight. 

Time to get paid, blow up like /u/Deepfuckinvalue ‘s trade!

Born autist, the opposite of a winner. 

Remember, we used to eat loss porn for dinner. 

We’re blowing up like the mods thought we would, ain’t nothing changed though, same group same sub. 

And if you don’t know, now you know, Retards!"
417,"There is no ""let them think this or that"". The DD for the bull case has been out in the open for longer than I've had an account that can post here, and longer than most of us have been on the sub. The only outs are for the GameStop board to vote against their own financial interest and make an offering or for retail regulations to come down hard (Pattern Day Trading? Pattern Week Trading regs are probably getting discussed after this.)"
418,"Nah. They work for free so they can also read the DD and invest I the ones they think are smart plays. 

Though maybe some very long term posters with good histories of DD or well educated replies could be added to the mod team. Getting a huge influx creates a wave in the forum and after the dust settles the active user base will be higher than before... kinda like GME stock prices."
419,"DD here; Don’t be a paper handed bitch, hold onto your shit, so you can throw it at Melvin and Vlad when we break the glass of our cages. Ape out."
420,"Holding through the weekend for sure. 

That Sundae cone tweet has me thinking GME will be making an announcement on Sunday. Probably something about acquiring business in Esports cause there’s some article about Citron saying that’s what Gamestop should do. In other words I am basing this entirely on the assumption that Citron is trying to regain their credibility through some insider info. How’s that for some smooth brained DD. 

I like the stock, and I can’t be fooled!"
421,"It’s still extremely shorted. FINRA reported 60.5% short interest as of feb 12, yesterday which is already very high. Remember, Anything over 20% is high. Also there’s tons of sketchy shit going on with shorting through index funds. Check out some of the DD here and on the gme sub regarding eX aRe Tee and other ETFs."

424,What happened is that this dude did his DD a long time ago and was in it for the long haul. He sank quite a bit into it and was laughed off of wsb just about. He even said that much of his work was based off other people’s work. He had a plan and committed to it. This event happened and now he reaps the reward of his hard work and DD. He has done nothing more than yolo on his thesis. I hope he 🚀🚀🚀🚀.
425,"Yup, i hate this narrative that the squeeze started because we saw a short stock and attacked it.

WSb haaated on the GME DD.

I wrote out a pretty decent little summary here:


https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l975qo/gme_the_case_for_a_value_play/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf"
426,Has anyone ever seen his DD on GameStop on his YouTube channel? There is no sign on manipulation. The man simply invests in stocks that he sees are undervalued. He’s a value investor. He simply shares his research on his channel.
427,"DFV didn’t mastermind anything, you can all go back and read his posts and watch his videos. He did good DD, took a risk, posted it to r/wallstreetbets where he was laughed at and turned into a meme. The dude was basically cyber bullied and just embraced it, and once GME started rising the meme went even more viral"
428,"So true. I was listening to the Roaring Kitty, and I believe the DD and the Deep Value investing approach. I have TSLA and NIO, now GME, for the same reason."
429,"Yea, I tried explaining this to someone who was bitching about him ruining reddit or some such, he was like “it’s all his fault (this was on a reddit post about the interview DFV did), he’s caused this to even be talked about in LoTR subs and it’s bullshit” - I was like, dude, he’s been long on gme since 2019 and all he ever did was give his DD and some ideas + his weekly updates, he never told anyone to buy gme or promote a blitzkrieg on the shorts etc - irritating how dense people are"
430,FWIW I never looked at any of deepfuckingvalue’s DD. I didn’t watch his Lord of The Rings Extended Cut YouTube videos explaining why he likes the stock. I did read an absurd amount of the extraordinary DD by others though. It’s that information that I consumed and continue consuming that informs my opinion of what I do with my money. It’s why I have faith in this process and why dips make me smirk. 🙌💎
431,I didn’t invest in October because dfv was at two mil but because the DD sounded low risk high reward but I’ve been rooting for him
432,"It's incredibly inspiring, particularly how DFV just let's all the doubters comments roll off his back like water on a duck.
I aspire to be have this kind of confidence in my DD."
433,Came here for this great DD.
434,"This subreddit is so fucked because of WSB getting popular on social media. 

The guy who made this post commented/posted in WSB for the first time 9 days ago and is now claiming to be a frequent of WSB. There was DD last week and a bunch of posts about silver."
435,"There was a shill here a few weeks ago and here and there since, that had great DD but it wasn't enough for me. If i buy silver; its to adorn myself and my tiny pp."
436,"Honestly, it feels like I haven't seen a single worthwhile DD post in a while. Certainly not for silver."
437,"Swear to god, I have been stalking this subreddit for more than 2 weeks now. I’m fucking obsessed with this GME thing. I lay awake at night dreaming about tendies, thinking should I drop my entire savings in this or not. 

Not anywhere, nowhere did any of you fellow retarded apes even usher the word SLV the last few days, if you did then you’re probably even more of a retard than us or you’re a fucking bot.

Fuck MNBC and any news network that propagandised this story to take our attention away from fucking with the 1%. 

Obligated 🚀🚀🚀

Not a financial adviser, I just like the stock. Do your own DD."
438,"I like silver, maybe you should hand out GME awards instead of silver awards. This used to be a DD or ban place. Now it’s GME or ban. Good luck in the echo chamber, buy GME or else."
439,"I have been on WSB since the sub had 30k people.

WSB has always been long on physical silver. Most C9rpto people are long on physical silver.

You laggots couldn't handle half the shit that is talked about here, go read some old yolo plays before you push your bot/ban nonsense.

Most of you have no fucking clue what you are doing, like sheep following the masses. Can't wait to hear you cry about the all the money you lose without allowing DD, Memes and varying opinions.

SILVER GANG! SLV Up another 100% today on longs. Get fucked you wife's boyfriend coddling crybabies."
440,"FxMacro on twitter was pushing ""WSB targeting SLV next"" last week which is how I found that one DD post in the first place and he's been pushing it hard ever since."
441,Good guy AP with the quality DD.
442,Silver is dangerous. Seriously. There have been a lot of DD on here about why buying silver is a fucking awful idea. A billionaire tried to fuck over the silver shorts back in the 80’s and he wiped out his ENTIRE family fortune. Hyping up silver is just the hedge fund’s attempt to pull money in because they’re losing so bad on GME.
443,"I’ve been doing some digging and have found A LOT of accounts similar to this. 2-3 year old accounts. DORMANT until this past week, dropping advice and “DD” and being given numerous awards (Reddit really needs to allow users to see who gave who what awards). 

I’ve also noticed a lot of accounts that were created exactly 300-something days ago and have no post history or karma and the only
Comments they have made have been about GME / AMC. 

If people don’t assume that these big money players are trying to infiltrate us from the inside then you’re kidding yourself. I guarantee they’re trying to plant specific ideas into this community to allow them to freely maneuver in the background and potentially blind side us."
444,Original post has hundreds and hundreds of awards when people have been patronizing any post that isn't about GME. Everything about that DD and the comments are sketch as fuck.
445,"Hello, yes. I am one of those accounts that joined during the March crash and couldn't post

But me and my friends have been trying to post my $AMC DD for the past 3 days and all of us just got auto-modded without any explanation. Maybe the DD is too long or is using too many hyperlinks (4 pages, 22 hyperlinks) 

But I've been trying to reach out to you, and others on the mod team in order to get this posted. We've tried 4 different accounts with anywhere between 100-4k karma with join date between last march and 2013. 

Please, could you help us post this research article? I believe it can benefit a lot of people holding a position.

Sorry for being annoying with all the messages. It's my current priority to find a way to get this into wsb for readers to see."
446,"This sub nearly dead. Too many actual retards have joined and think we are just an angry mob. Every single post is an all caps title with some stupid Twitter screen grab. We lost control of our own movement of posting good DD, calling each other autistic, making outlandish bets and the occasional ass tattoo"
447,"The problem is people are falling for the same bullshit CNN does with ""single anonymous source"". Quite often those stories drive a bunch of clicks, but turn out to be completely fucking false. Don't even try to trust anything that isn't from a public entity that you can research yourself and make your own judgement on how truthful they might be. Even people you don't like stick to patterns, and a statement will either be inline with their character or not...and you can at least make a much more measured judgement of the information than with some random internet account. Obviously I include myself as an example of a ""single anonymous source""; so don't fucking trust me either.......DD."
448,"It's also not the worst UI, just... ""classic"" in it's layout.

Tough on the mobile app to do DD though."

450,"Essential information. Add to wiki!

For the Gourd thing, this includes the history posts which makes it even funnier: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzu2rh/good_gourd/


I've been thinking we also need some sort of history timeline on GME, starting with DFV in September 2019, his financials DD video in July '20, Cohen joining and other news that sparked more and more support. Just for the new people but also the journos and now politicians who might come looking here for info on what the cause was. Since the corrupt media will endlessly say it's a meme stock and there are zero fundamentals and it's some dead B&M store, but none of that is true."

I understand now"
452,"You forgot the part where the first win is free. Everyone about to ride this free GME win but they’ll be sad when they dip their toes in a 30k Tsla call because Elon said his pig brain chips will let you play games on your new Tesla so there’s speculation that a $20,000 call way otm might hit so you buy a nice fat weekly yolo based off some dumb ass low level DD and bam next thing you know you’re down 98% roi because Tesla tanked hard and you gotta grind your way back up. 

So yea knock out enough brain cells and you can be like me and climb back up from near triple digits to 6 digits."
453,"I would add don't ask questions like ""someone tell me what to do"" because you are on your own in terms of making decisions. You have to make your own decisions on what makes sense for you.

454,"You mean ""Autist did his DD""!"
455,"I kind of agree. But if you bought shares for every shares for the stock that had elaborate DD in this sub you almost exclusively made money if you didnt paper hand  **🧻✋** like a retard. TSLA, NIO, AAPL, PRPL, PLTR, GME are just the most notable examples.  
Ofc you're gonna get fucked if you buy weeklies first day in or sell at the slightest dip."
456,"Fuck.  I mean, remember the guy that did the math? Shit was solid DD. 😂"
457,"So these guys legit think were just dumb as fuck. 

I mean any given Sunday I might have fallen for their shit, and diverted my attention to DD some other plays, maybe some have, but GME is the fight I CHOOSE to fight, I like the stock and no one will persuade me to walk away for anything less than MARS...... >$1000 or bust.  

This isn't just about GME for me, I'm old enough to remember the Occupy Wall Street movement.  They fucked around and got away with it, this time I'm getting mine.  GME for the long term.

This is the WAY.....for me

458,"Alright, as happy as I am for everyone making $ off GME (including myself), last I checked this was WSB and not a GME subreddit. If people want to share, talk and discuss other stocks, it’s not sus or shill, it’s normal. If enough people hop on the stock after doing their DD, then obviously it’s worth the hype. 

I’m sure I’ll get down voted, but I’m getting tired of people getting butt hurt because people want to have discourse on stocks other than GME. It’s not US vs. THEM. It’s a community. And a community doesn’t have to agree on everything."
459,Yea my dumbass was newer around the LL times and lost a couple hundred on it lol. Taught me to actually read the DD and vet out which ones are real or not
460,"No worries man. Your doing good. Risk is in everything even this. You have to be willing to risk  what you want to risk. Comfortable with losing. I've had so many people trying to convince me to pull out but I have faith in the DD and this community. Keep learning, keep earning brother."

I'm super fucking happy for you that you were able to go from your old situation to being a HOMEOWNER!  That's legit dude.  Just keep doing what you're doing and keep appreciating what you have.  I honestly think that's the best way to save.

I know this is WSB and everyone's all about the YOLO, but I would seriously consider taking a portion of that savings and buying up some sort of good, promising crypto that you can stake for interest. Algorand and Cosmos are what I chose after a lot of DD, but don't take my word for anything lol.  I just think Algo is a super solid place to put a good portion of my savings and let it grow while the team accumulates new partners."
465,"# Things we should keep in mind today:

&#x200B;

* There is no way to predict when the squeeze will happen
   * There will be crazy price action in both directions
   * This can go on as long as the shorts remain solvent
   * The longer they drag this out, the higher it goes
   * People might say, ""Lift-Off in 10!"" But they're just excited
   * Nobody knows when it'll happen or how high it will go
      * Use your favorite service to set price alerts so that **when** the squeeze happens, you'll be ready. Everyone's looking out for it, and nobody wants to risk missing out, so get notified.

Basically, don't believe the hype, but feel free to join in. You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

In other words, **fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.**

&#x200B;

* There is no ""we.""
   * I'm holding because that's my choice. I believe in GME
   * I will not buy because someone else says to do so
   * I will not encourage others to buy
   * Nothing I say is financial advice
   * If you're confused, read the rules. No market manipulation.
      * All references to the words ""we"" and ""us"" in this post refer to individual retail investors who believe that GME is drastically undervalued and make their own decisions and do their own research.

Report posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.

&#x200B;

* There will be plenty of FUD (or ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt"")
   * I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite
   * There are redditors being paid to scare you
   * There are bots made to SPAM negativity
   * There are people profiting when you sell
   * This starts ramping up in the afternoon

There are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail. There are people playing the other side who *will* come into the thread and try to throw us off track by ruining the morale. We mustn't give in to them. Besides, they can't even provide any good DD for their bear-case, it's all just ""*sElL iT's OvEr.*""

&#x200B;

* This is the motherfucking **GME Megathread**
   * Do not push other tickers
   * Do not jingle keys in our faces
   * Fuck you

I, personally, go out of my way to CTRL/CMD+F and search for other tickers. If you're bringing up non-GME stocks in order to distract the thread, I'm one of the downvotes on your comment. Sue me.

&#x200B;

* We can fucking do this
   * We have them where we want them
   * We can name our price
   * As long as we hold, we have what they want
   * They will pay out the ass to get it

They'll do whatever they can (manipulate the market, short the stock further, short EFTs, etc.) for as long as they can manage, all hoping we'll give up and sell (Hell, they've even tried to bore us to death). But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.

&#x200B;

* Important reminders
   * Don't give yourself a heart attack by staring at the chart all day
   * Drink water. Just take a sip every time you look at the chart
   * If the squeeze doesn't happen today, that doesn't mean it's over

&#x200B;

* If you're new, this may not be for you
   * This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for
   * You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses
   * Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD
   * Read the DD
   * Read the DD
      * DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.

And now, obligatory emojis:

# 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑💎👐💎👐🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌📈📈📈📈

>TLDR; If you need a TLDR, then you shouldn't be in the short squeeze. You're taking a serious risk by skipping the research required to make smart decisions, and I highly discourage you from doing so. Read the DD, read like your fucking life depends on it.

If you think there's anything else I should add, please reply and tell me."
466,"All I gotta say is if you’re here asking “what day is the squeeze? When’s the squeezening?” Or “ITLL HAPPEN ON 3/19!!!” You’re in GME for the wrong reasons. This thread is full of mouth breathers and bots. Nobody has a crystal ball here.

If you believe in the thesis - buy what you can afford and hold on. 

The whole RKT shit may or may not be a distraction - theres DD on it going back a few weeks, and yeah I can feel the FOMO, I wanted to get in weeks ago but couldn’t make up my mind. Anyone who made money on RKT today, congrats and fuck you - you hit the jackpot on a $5 scratchy.

I’m still in on GME from January - I trimmed my position a few times because I needed some money back but I’m still 50 @ 38."
467,"Guys can you please stop freaking out.
Dont celebrate greens, dont stress reds.

Its simply not important.
The price explosion will come from shorts having to cover. In the meantime its simply a matter of holding and waiting to drain the stock supply.

Read DD, understand what is going on.. Because seriously, the only way you're price stressing is because you dont know whats going on...🤦🏻‍♂️"
468,"I am so disappointed in wsb. DFV found a golden goose and was kind enough to share his DD. Some of you guys are besmirching his good name by chasing golden eggs like silver, AMC, and RKT. Weak. Very weak."
469,Done.  Please keep updating me with your crystal ball mealtime metric DD
470,Whenever I see all those badges on a post. I know the DD is fucking facts.
471,I'm new here. Is this DD?
472,">How can we be more confident squeeze be squoze with this data though?

I don't understand the question.

>No paper hands here, I'm just curious.

As much as we joke here, you should sell at the price that makes sense for you to sell at.

>Time limits?

There is no time limit on a short position. They pay interest to hold their short position which in turn may impose a time limit.

>Are they just continuously covering and shorting more as the price drops?

That is possible. I personally believe the strongest hypothesis is that they are shorting it continuously to drive the price down.

>Won't they continue to do that?

To cover their short positions right now would cost billions of dollars since the vast majority of the shorting occurred when GMEs price was about $14, which is to say that the dollar cost average of their short position was around 14 dollars. To cover at the top would have cost tens of billions of dollars, so it is unlikely they were able to cover much outside of what they were forced to cover. I think they went right back to shorting it once the buy pressure was off due to all the brokerage debacles.

>How can we be any more sure?

In particular, it's hard to say because of the information imbalance.

In general, to increase or decrease your confidence in the truth of something you will need to do your due dilligence (DD), i.e., do your research. Good luck!"
473,Here's the DD you seek 💎🍆

DD"
475,"GOOD MORNING EVERYONE!!! I wrote this in yesterday’s thread but wanted to share here: 

Their strategy is to let it climb a little in AH and even more in PM so when the bell opens people think they’re selling “high” and paper hands will be gone in the first 20 minutes. Trade sideways all day to piss off the people actually watching, and then rinse and repeat. They really do think you’re that stupid, it’s obvious to anyone who’s been watching the past few weeks, shit even the past few months.

This, is not, a stock. It’s not moving like a stock, it’s not trading like a stock, it’s not covered by the media like a stock, so stop talking about healthy pre market and “this looks bullish” because we have no idea what it looks like. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD, and wait till they bleed out. Their moves are simple and desperate, which means they’re running out of time. Every pass is a Hail Mary and we will intercept one of them and run it back to our end zone soon enough.

EDIT: I’m aware my account is new, I jumped on this in January with barely any knowledge (proof in comments) and really loved what you guys were doing so I’ve been buying and holding ever since. I have read a ton of DD and learned everything I could in the past couple months which still is nothing compared to some of you. I appreciate all the love and I think the best part of this group is you can be a true retard like me and in just a short time... well I’m still retarded, but I like the stock 😜"
476,"I just zoomed out and asked my 7 year old niece to exam the chart for me, she says it's UPPITY...what more DD do you need??"
477,"Good morning, apes.  

**You can probably expect fear, uncertainty, and doubt tactics to be in full effect today, just like yesterday.**

You read the DD, **you know what's going to happen**.  The ticker does not matter.  This shit is gonna moon whether you like it or not.  Hang in there. ❤️🚀💎🙌🏿"
478,"Remember countless people have used their free time and resources to provide quality DD, u/deepfuckingvalue was mocked for his original genius thesis. The dips were worrisome in the beginning then i read some DD and my nerves chilled. Now DD is abundant and good quality. This event has brought a lot of new traders here, the best weapon you can arm yourself with is information. We are playing at a disadvantage, DD is helping equal the playing field. All the FUD loses its fangs when you realize hedgie moves are being predicted/ can be accurately described. Stay strong ape, tomorrow is another day in the fight🚀"
479,"Exactly! 
While I truly enjoy reading all the great DD and predictions, in my opinion any technical analysis, graphs and indicators are not to be trusted with GME, not because the people doing the DD don't know what they are doing but because of the way the stock is being manipulated. JUST HOLD!!!"
480,"People need to understand that he is talking about a Campusedge account or Core checking with student waiver account most likely and specifically referring to the time between being a student or getting a job after graduating. 

All of these posts about the ways to beat it do not apply because as a college student or someone leaving school, you cannot meet most of them. You do not have enough money to meet the DD. You can't get ebanking accounts anymore. This is a checking not saving account so the 25 dollar thing doesn't work. He probably has lost a student waiver so that doesn't work either. It's not about reading the fine print. He's most likely complaining because after reading the fine print, they don't offer viable student options. "
481,"Cash. Cold hard cash. Some people's occupations, they get paid in cash and its uncomfortable to have a couple hundred in cash on you. Couldn't do that with our BOA account, because the nearest B&M branch is 2 hours away. Until I started up my job, it was irrelevant because checks were done by the app and everything else was DD. But then I started a business that deals mostly in cash. 

So that necessitated opening an account with a bank that was in my city and not ""local"" only so that my husband could go drop the cash off on payday and I don't have to walk around with 500 bucks in m wallet."
482,"Yeah, even for places that have fees, as long as you know the rules, you'll be fine.

One of my side banks will waive the fee if either you keep $100 min balance, or have direct deposit. Doesn't even matter how much it is. I literally have my employer split my DD and send $5 to that account and I've never gotten the fee."
483,Some Reddit level DD here Mr musk.
484,"He’s either massively manipulating the market for his benefit, or he didn’t do his DD before buying into BTC. If it’s the latter then the board members at Tesla need to get him the fuck away from the purse strings like right now. But as the owner of a multi billion dollar company, I sincerely doubt it is the latter..."
485,"It's hard to believe he didn't DD BTC... He is probably just testing the market, see how it reacts, or maybe he is just bored.. I mean I still don't understand his plan with Doge... I really don't get that guy"

0,"PSA: FOR ANYONE WHO CANNOT BUY GME STOCK BECAUSE TRADING 212 HAS STOPPED ALLOWING BUY ORDERS

It is absolutely disgraceful and reprehensible that Trading 212 is not allowing people to buy shares in GME. This is market manipulation to the core. Thankfully, there are a couple of ways around it.

1. Currently, it is possible to purchase GME shares on Trading 212 via the German market, instead of the NYSE. If you search 'GS2C' in the T212 search bar you will find GME under the DE and will be able to purchase shares. However, it is possible that T212 will catch on and limit people buying shares on this market as well. This takes me to the next solution.
2. Download a different broker app - FreeTrade allows one to make an account incredibly quickly and easily. You will need a pro account to make trades, which costs 9.99 a month, however you will make plenty more from trading GME stock. Furthermore, you will not be charged until February 3rd anyway so you can still opt out by that time.

Today I was trying to make new accounts in various apps and FreeTrade gave me the least hassle - I didn't have to go through leaps and bounds to make an account. I am in no way affiliated to FreeTrade it is just what I found best when trying to buy more GME stock today.

This is not financial advice.

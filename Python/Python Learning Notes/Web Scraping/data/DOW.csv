0,"I'm a little careful on calling it short-term.  Looking back at 2008, the market cut in almost half (16k to 9k) and it took \~5 years to return to its original level.  We could be as good as being at the bottom, or we could just be starting to roll off a steep edge.  It could be better, it could be worse.  Just hope we don't do the equivalent of the Great Depression\*, which went from 5k down to 800 (1929 to 1932) and took until 1958 (29 years) to recover.  \*Note: inflation adjusted numbers in DOW historical.

If someone reads short-term as meaning <1 year and can cash out, they probably want to hold that as cash in hand.  If they read short-term as <3 years, they're still not necessarily in a good spot.  If we're strictly talking retirement accounts for someone 10+ years out, this is an inconsequential speed bump and a good spot to buy.

1,"That's what I meant.  Now probably isn't a bad time if you're investing with retirement in mind unless things *really* go to shit.  We're cheaper than we've been in a while - we first hit this DOW rating in 2018.

Could it go lower?  Absolutely.  Could it go much, much lower?  Absolutely.  Could it be bottomed out and rebound this week?  Absolutely.  Does anyone know for sure?  Absolutely not.

I'd sooner believe we're not done going down and may drop a good bit more.  I think shut-downs, supply issues, and the number of people that will lose work because fewer will eat out or go to large gatherings will further tip the market.

Still, it's important to note that one of my other replies to a reply on this comment is about a friend that loves to remind me kittens out picked a manager in a short-term investment strategy.  The stock market is considered a risk for a reason.

Edit: Note that I don't know the details of your settlement fund, and I am **not** a financial adviser."
2,"I agree with this when compared to day trading stocks, however I think actively managing your 401k can be effective. I was fortunate and made adjustments to my 401k on 02/18 away from my higher risk DOW and S&P accounts and into government securities. So far this has saved my retirement balance 10s of thousands of dollars in loses. I'm monitoring trends until there is a bit more stability before throwing those funds back into the higher risk areas. How is timing like this not benifitial? Even if I'm slow to get back in, the market needs to climb a lot before it's above 02/18 prices."
3,">I was fortunate and made adjustments to my 401k on 02/18 away from my higher risk DOW and S&P accounts and into government securities.

You basically answered your own question. What you did was timing the market with a roughly educated guess; you were fortunate in having timed it correctly. Just because you managed to do this once, or even a couple of times, does not indicate that you will be able to do it successfully again. We obviously know now that the current situation caused a market downturn, but there was no way to know that with certainty in mid-February; if there was, the market would have dropped then. There was a real chance (again, at the time) that you were wrong, and you could have cost yourself thousands in gains."

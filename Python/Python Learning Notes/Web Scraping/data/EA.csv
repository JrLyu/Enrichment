1,"What do now

EDIT: 💎🙏 BOYS 💎🙏 LOOK TO THE EAST ON THE FIFTH DAY AT DAWN. TRUST IN DEEPFUCKINGVALUE

THEYRE SCARED. FOR EVERY ACTION THERE IS AN EQUAL AND OPPOSITE REACTION. PREPARE FOR 🚀

POSITION: 53 SHARES AT 282 EA ABOUT TO DUMP ANOTHER 10K IN TO AVERAGE DOWN"
2,So At&t is the EA meme of 2018 already?
3,Should have said holding until EA creates a brand new original title without paywalls and micro transactions.
4,Make me a mod or I'll buy so much EA stock that they can buy nintendo
5,"Looks like BofA is still sore about EA stealing consumerist's ""worst company in america"" award from them two years in a row and wants to reclaim it."
6,Or EA's groove. They're arguably worse.
7,"Buddy of mine was at EA for several years.  Long enough that he went from grunt modeler to art lead.

Made the same wage.

Threatened to quit, they tripled his salary.  Apparently he was still underpaid.  I think he's still there.

Ninja edit: Also, fuck EA."
8,"Remember when NFLX sent you DVDs in the mail? One day I’ll say, remember when GME sold games in a store? Hang in there. When that time comes GME will have a 25B market cap. EA and ATVI will one day partner with a streaming service provider. SONY and MSFT can’t dominate all that bandwidth forever. 🚀👀 

^ not investing advice, as I’m only a clairvoyant ape"
9,"The internet is going to collectively put these fucks on full blast until they are sufficiently visible to the highest authorities.

It's like how EA was put on full blast for their MTX and now they have bettered their ways.

This collective didn't exist in '08. It does now, so we better use it to make sure this bullshit doesn't go unpunished."

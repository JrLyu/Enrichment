"I own 4 ED Dec 15 87.5 calls and am short 2 Dec 15 90 calls.  ED will go Ex dividend Monday and pay an 81 cent dividend.

At what price for the stock and option should I exercise some or all of the long calls to collect the dividend?

Clearly if ED falls below 87.5 I should not exercise. Conversely, If ED is above 90, should I expect the short calls to be exercised and I get a short postion?"

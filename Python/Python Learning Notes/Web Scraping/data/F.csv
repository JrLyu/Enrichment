12,"God I miss the old WSB.

The WSB where everyone was in pure option plays for an earnings play or long-term play, and we'd laugh at the fucking idiot who had a week to go on his 1 yr call option, sitting at -95%... Only for that mother fucker to hit 300% on that very friday.

WSB'ers know the game. They know what it's like to be hurting, squeezing for adding in more margin, getting in that last contract even though you're a blow away from GUHing your future. Know what we'd do? ""Just delete the app, restart!""

You morons are crying about going down 30 and 40%? No. You're already a paper holding F*G**T. If you didn't have the confidence of knowing that you may be down 80% tomorrow, but will be up 300% at the end of the week, then you shouldn't of been in this trade in the first place.

This is a kind of trade financial advisors scream at you for doing because its idiotic, foolhardy, and plain retarded. That's why this will *work*. BUT ONLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME BEING PLAYED.

So shut up about your paper handing bullshit because no one wants to hear it. The OG's have been through it, we've all suffered bigger losses before, but the reason it's an echo chamber is because THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AS SURE OF A THING THAN RIGHT NOW! So pull that dildo out of your asshole you gay bear and BUY $GME"
13,"The free floating stocks (49% of the company, tradable by the public) are the stocks the company(Gamestop) sold to the public (the market).  
The majority (51%) they kept for themselves to keep the majority of the comapny (duh).  
So ""the over 100%"" that you stated are over 100% of the public stocks !!! NOT overall stocks !  
The company(Gamestop) will hold their 51% forever(to keep the majority).  
So NOW the public has to WANT to sell ""A F**KING WHOLE OF A LOT"" or else they(the hedge fund) can't close their positions(they have to buy)(witch they 100% have to).  
And if they 100% have to (wich they do) they have to buy at EvEry price (litteraly every).  
This will happen in the next days (not now and not tomorrow).  
So 1000-10000 is as strange as it sounds in reach, if nobody sells.

19,"I'm thinking it will be 1) a hedge fund or group of them fucking over current shorts or 2) Gamestop releases news to F them over

Companies shorted to this degree are not happy about it. Naked shorting essentially dilutes their current owners and increases their cost to raise capital. The fact that Gamestop hasn't even discussed an offering or communicated, makes me think they are analyzing this carefully (or maybe they are as retarded as I am and they are just doing nothing lol).

If they did some kind of recall (I don't even know how this works to be honest) I wonder if they could then negotiate an offering with all the naked shorts?

Another possible trigger would be pre-announcing earnings and naming Ryan Cohen CEO, but I'm not sure if that was ever in the original plan for RC. He's obviously intelligent and has the ear of the board, but if he becomes the voice of Gamestop, I wonder if that's enough to trigger a mad dash for the exits.

Everytime I'm nervous about this stock, I just think about the HFs that are short and they have to be just as nervous. This is a ticking timebomb with this short interest and having no idea what your victim (Gamestop) is thinking about.

A game of chess at its finest."

29,"It's the banking world's dirty secret ever since 1907 when JP Morgan (the man not the bank) had to bail out the US government. Shorting, volume and supply can cause catastrophic results especially if everyone decides fuck this I am taking my cash out the banking system. Look at this from wiki - sounds familiar:

Augustus' brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.[19]
To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, president of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding.[20] Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.[21]
The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the New York Stock Exchange, literally an outdoor market ""on the curb"" (this curb market would later become the American Stock Exchange). After the crash, The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market"".[22]

Contagion spreadsEdit

The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.
F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time,[23] by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests.[24] By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.[25]
A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the Pittsburgh city's stock exchange closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907"

41,"To be honest.  When an account is closed it's closed.  There is no adding interest that day, it'd be a pending transaction and account will not be allowed to close.  Or it hit that morning and became a posted transaction depending on how the bank does it (refund fees are immediate posts at SWIM's work and can be closed that day). OR a banker just gave you all cash to drop to zero with intent to close the next day and forgets to.  That's likely 99% of the time SWIM's personal 10 year experience. People close accounts because they don't have the same titling (closing a business account, the owner may not have accounts else where to deposit),  or someone actually asks for cash and they are willing to take someone's word of 4 month experience to remember to close an account, because they desperately need funds available (cash) before next business day or longer.  

Always get proof don't just trust someone.  Get a cashiers check when closed and sign the debit form closing it through their teller system.  Literally if you are just given cash, it's a pending transaction *even though it's cash*, and a banker physically cannot close it by regulation....

Edit: already too long but feeling like educating those that may not know what I think is seemingly F'd up and counter-intuitive? You can't just remove someone from an account even if they want to be taken off. If your mom opened your first checking account with you because you needed an adult to obtain it, you cannot remove her even if she comes in, completely willing to.  You can get in the biggest fight with your spouse/family member, can't remove them, but can close the account and open a new one without their name as a signer, with the same money/check produced at closing.  Death and sometimes divorce are the only ways to remove someone, yet just one owner can decide to close the account without the other signer present.  This will always baffle SWIM even in the industry...  okay done. "
42,"Work at a Credit Union in BC but Im sure it's the same process. If your bank/credit union doesn't have a cheque scanner in branch they have to physically mail the cheques each day to a  third party corporation that processes cheque (from all the F.I's) and after they process them your bank will be notified (could take the 2-3 days)
 The issue that was being brought up originally was cheque holds which are different for each person and depend on a variety of factors for a cheque to either be held, deposited, or partially deposited."

51,"Exactly this! To be quite frank, after I read that post I messaged my mother-in-law (Chinese and lives in China) about NIO. Specifically I asked her “what are you thoughts on NIO and what are the general thoughts of Chinese on NIO.” She replied back and I quote “is it made in China?”  Then went on to saying and I apologize but this is using translator, “If it's a car made in China, it's a long way to go on a single charge. It means a new car. After a year or two, the charge will not be fully charged, we call floating power, that is, it is full, there is not so much charge, it will not run so far. This is a common phenomenon of electric cars made in China” then she went on saying the following.

“On August 14, 2018, the rumors of NextCar going public in the United States finally implemented hammer, its high-profile financial data also unveiled mysterious veil.
According to its F-1 prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, From January to June 2018, Neolai achieved total revenue of 45,991,000 yuan, including 44,399,000 yuan from car sales and a net loss of 3,326 million yuan.
As of July 31, 2018, NextCar's first production model, the ES8, has delivered 481 units, with more than 17,000 orders outstanding.
According to previously disclosed plans, NextCar will deliver 10,000 units of the original ES8 by October 1 this year. So far, the target delivery figures are far from being met.” 

To be quite honest I dunno what the fuck she is talking about in the last quote, maybe you retards do. Never heard of NextCar and can’t really find anything on it."

59,"This whole movement has caught my attention, here is why - here's my story for those who care to read it.

I'm 33 - Like many people, I have student loan debt & Credit Card debt. - And barely a part time job able to pay the interest on these debts. Over years of ""saving"" I've been able to squirrel a tiny bit away. - I will be using that for you guys here if I can get a brokerage account opened, in Canada.  


Back before I went to University I believed that society would provide the opportunity for me to work off my debt, and life would be fair - and I'd be in a better position after college than before. **Boy was I wrong**. Two University Degrees + Trade school as a welder, and God F'ing (&%\*(\*, just about every time I see a shred of hope of job opportunities and work pup up. Somehow someway, the businesses offering the opportunities gets fucked one way or another. Because of this, I always seem to find myself working any job I can find, at crappy rates no one else wants to work for. Simply to pay for the interest on my Loans and Credit Debt. There is simply NO light at the end of the tunnel. I'm stuck in a perpetual hamster wheel of work and pay interest, while needing to eat at the same time. I'm driving a truck that's older than I am, because I can't afford anything newer, and I'm stuck with the prospect of paying for ever increasing gas prices for that - just to get to and from part time jobs, to pay for the interest on my loans! F'ING HAMSTER WHEEL!  


With the cancelation of KXL in my area, a whole new whack of unemployed individuals are going to be competing for any job they can, just to feed their kids. (Love or hate the industry, it still provides food for children of these families). I fortunately, don't have a family to feed - I personally feel, It would be irresponsible for me to start one (being denied that option in life even if its self imposed is just not right - and at its core feels like a deep injustice in the world.) I would be unable to financially provide for them. 

&#x200B;

Yet as squeezed as I am. I still feel the pressure to give up some of my part time work, so those with more need can actually feed their kids. Then I see people on wall street getting bailouts and windfalls and utterly destroying businesses - and making the situation much much worse. It's wrong.  


So, here's what I'm going to do. This cycle has to stop. I'm going to dump as much as I possibly can of my savings on this stock - It's not much. Quite literally, quarters of change over the years - I'd been saving for things like toothpaste.

I don't care if I make a profit or loose money on this - I am going to hold it. Just for the sake of holding it. They've been squeezing us dry all over the world for years - it's time we did the same to them.

I'm going to print out the stock (the receipt if I have to) - and nail it to the f'ing wall of my cabin in the woods, where I can look at it for the next 30 years and use it as a motivational reason to continue to get up in the morning. Just so I can look at it and know that I'm not alone in my disgust towards the parasites at wall street.  


For that reason ALONE the stock has great value to me, and It ALWAYS will."

65,"Matt Levine write about this in his latest blog:

“There are 100 shares. A owns 90 of them, B owns 10. A lends her 90 shares to C, who shorts them all to D. Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90—there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”

Now A owns 90 shares, B owns 10 and D owns 90—there are 100 shares outstanding, but 190 shares show up on ownership lists. (The accounts balance because C owes 90 shares to A, giving C, in a sense, negative 90 shares.) Short interest is 90 shares out of 100 outstanding. Now D lends her 90 shares to E, who shorts them all to F. Now A owns 90, B 10, D 90 and F 90, for a total of 280 shares. Short interest is 180 shares out of 100 outstanding. No problem! No big deal! You can just keep re-borrowing the shares. F can lend them to G! It's fine.”

Thx Matt Levine ‘Moneystuff’ if any of you wanna learn"
67,"Naked shorting is a thing. What happens when C shorts shares which he DOESN'T have to D? How about E doing the same to F? See the situation this creates? A possesses 90, B holds 10. C is on the hook for 90 non-existent shares which now belong to D. E also has to account for the 90 shares which now belong to F. Even though only 100 shares exist, there are 280 shares in ownership only balanced by 180 I.O.U.s.

Imagine having to purchase 180 shares when ONLY 100 exist."

74,"Tbh, part of the part of ""eating in"" that's helped me cut my budget so much is eating processed foods. I learned that if it's between ordering in and spending an hour to cook spaghetti all by my lonesome, I'll probably order food in. 

So part of this is eating $2 TV dinners, $.50 mac n cheese bowls, $.25 oatmeal packets, $1 can of soup, $1 sandwich, $2 salad, here and there. I've learned I can stick to eating mostly ""cruddy"" food so long as its varied. I honestly only really ""cook"" about once or twice a week. 

My typical meals as of late have been 1 packet of oatmeal M-F, eggs on the weekend for breakfast, frozen meal M-F for lunch, some sandwich or soup or salad or something on the weekends, and dinner varies. Soup, salad, red beans and rice, whatever. I might spend $50 more a month for processed foods, but I know myself enough to know that I *won't* cook even three or four times a week and I *will* order out if I don't have an easy meal. "

76,"How the F do you get to 300% yearly return? I only do ETFs so i only really get the marker so obviously i rank lower, but my 27% are already insanely high for 8 months in the market... i cant imagine 300% without major risk lol"

80,"THEYRE FUCKING IDIOTS. We aren’t like the previous generations, most of us are financially literate and most of us know they do not teach us financial literacy in school. 

So we taught ourselves. We taught each other. 

I was a late in life baby and my parents had me close to retirement (M: 43 / F: 55). I got the pleasure to watch my mother and father struggle most of my life. Especially during the 2008 crisis. my dad spent his entire life tobacco farming and throwing money into the stock market. He lived well-to-ok for the first 70 years of his life only to sell the farm he grew up on in 2010 and now lives off of a social security check and worked until COVID. My mother is a retired teacher and receives a small pension but still has to work. 

BECAUSE THESE WALLSTREET FUCKS SHORTED THE HOUSING MARKET
THE OTHER WALLSTREET FUCKS AT BLACKSTONE PISSED AWAY MY FATHERS RETIREMENT
AND THE ASSHOLES WHO OVERSEE MY MOTHER’S TEACHERS PENSION SOMEHOW COULDNT GENERATE MORE THAN $2,300 A MONTH EVEN THOUGH SHE PAID INTO FOR OVER F-O-R-T-Y FUCKING YEARS 

There is no time to die. We aren’t fucking leavin’. The show goes on. It’s gonna take a fucking WRECKING BALL to take us out"
81,ultimately it ruined my dad’s business and was the final nail that led to divorce and broke up our family.. I have 5k in at the moment. I’m successful by all standards and pay my taxes.. first stock ever traded for me.. you think I forget 08? you think I’m selling? you think I care if it drops? You clearly don’t know what you started. I’m going to the moon. I don’t give a F what happens to this stock.. as far as I’m concerned this 5k was never mine to begin with. It’s fuel for our rocket ship. and the kicker? Everytime it dips.. I’m throwing in just a little more.. nothing crazy.. just a share.. why? because diamond hands. That’s why.
82,"At least it's goddamn honest. At least it provides people with pleasure and the convenience to get going quickly. 

Quick back story. I served 10 years in the military. Electrician on F/A 18 C's and Fuel Systems on F-22 Raptors (Navy and VA ANG, respectively). I now supervise crews for my county's public works road department (yes, I still operate heavy equipment, I'm a participative leader). When I get called out in the middle of the night because trees are down or ice is on the roads:

I am GODDAMN thankful that anyone is open and making delicious food and coffee. Otherwise, I am a miserable ass. When I'm a miserable ass, I don't work as fast and my life sucks. SO, thank you. (And FUCK the hedge fund assholes)"
83,"So as an outsider, If I decided to open an account with Vanguard, and purchase a share or two because that's all the money I can afford to throw away trying F(\*& with hedge funds I would have no problem, and you can get a shit ton of people like me to do the same, we can have the same affect?

86,"# Things we should keep in mind today:

&#x200B;

* There is no way to predict when the squeeze will happen
   * There will be crazy price action in both directions
   * This can go on as long as the shorts remain solvent
   * The longer they drag this out, the higher it goes
   * People might say, ""Lift-Off in 10!"" But they're just excited
   * Nobody knows when it'll happen or how high it will go
      * Use your favorite service to set price alerts so that **when** the squeeze happens, you'll be ready. Everyone's looking out for it, and nobody wants to risk missing out, so get notified.

Basically, don't believe the hype, but feel free to join in. You should do your own research, read the DD, and make informed decisions. Don't invest money you can't afford to lose.

In other words, **fuck safely, or you'll get fucked.**

&#x200B;

* There is no ""we.""
   * I'm holding because that's my choice. I believe in GME
   * I will not buy because someone else says to do so
   * I will not encourage others to buy
   * Nothing I say is financial advice
   * If you're confused, read the rules. No market manipulation.
      * All references to the words ""we"" and ""us"" in this post refer to individual retail investors who believe that GME is drastically undervalued and make their own decisions and do their own research.

Report posts that encourage everyone to buy at the same time. The primary reason for this is legal, but the secondary is that the media will cherry-pick comments like this to give us a bad name and put more negativity out there through their articles, broadcasts, etc.

&#x200B;

* There will be plenty of FUD (or ""fear, uncertainty, and doubt"")
   * I am including this out of belief, if not pure spite
   * There are redditors being paid to scare you
   * There are bots made to SPAM negativity
   * There are people profiting when you sell
   * This starts ramping up in the afternoon

There are two sides to this fight, and we have to remember that there are people profiting if we fail. There are people playing the other side who *will* come into the thread and try to throw us off track by ruining the morale. We mustn't give in to them. Besides, they can't even provide any good DD for their bear-case, it's all just ""*sElL iT's OvEr.*""

&#x200B;

* This is the motherfucking **GME Megathread**
   * Do not push other tickers
   * Do not jingle keys in our faces
   * Fuck you

I, personally, go out of my way to CTRL/CMD+F and search for other tickers. If you're bringing up non-GME stocks in order to distract the thread, I'm one of the downvotes on your comment. Sue me.

&#x200B;

* We can fucking do this
   * We have them where we want them
   * We can name our price
   * As long as we hold, we have what they want
   * They will pay out the ass to get it

They'll do whatever they can (manipulate the market, short the stock further, short EFTs, etc.) for as long as they can manage, all hoping we'll give up and sell (Hell, they've even tried to bore us to death). But they don't understand just how dumb we really are. We are far too stupid to be afraid of their fearmongering, and we'll hold 'til the moon.

&#x200B;

* Important reminders
   * Don't give yourself a heart attack by staring at the chart all day
   * Drink water. Just take a sip every time you look at the chart
   * If the squeeze doesn't happen today, that doesn't mean it's over

&#x200B;

* If you're new, this may not be for you
   * This is something you have to be really brave or really stupid for
   * You will either see enormous gains or enormous losses
   * Invest wisely, don't spend your rent money, and read the DD
   * Read the DD
   * Read the DD
      * DD is short for Due Diligence, and it's basically just researching a stock before you buy in. There's plenty of great DD on this sub, and you can sort by the DD flair to see the highest-voted posts. Do that before asking dumb questions and risking your karma.

And now, obligatory emojis:

# 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌑🌑💎👐💎👐🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌📈📈📈📈

>TLDR; If you need a TLDR, then you shouldn't be in the short squeeze. You're taking a serious risk by skipping the research required to make smart decisions, and I highly discourage you from doing so. Read the DD, read like your fucking life depends on it.

If you think there's anything else I should add, please reply and tell me."

A loosing war of attrition with Diamond Handed Apes and another against their own F'in COUNTRY!!! They quite literally have no souls.....

88,"Buffet didn't make this bet to claim index are better than picking stocks. He made his fortune picking the right stocks by doing good research. He's saying hedge fund managers and other active managed products are usually deceiving. They make claims on their gains but omit the cost of fees. Plus they are rarely purely looking out for your interest because they get kick backs for dumping money into a buddy's stock or fund. The takeaway from this isn't don't pick stocks. It's don't trust active managers' claim. To a laymen who's not upper middle to upper class, where this is most applicable is in your 401k. 

We are all told our 401ks are great savings vehicles but the best argument for them isn't even because of something the financial managers are doing. It's the tax exemption that was put in place by the Federal government. While tax exemption is good, if you think putting in $500k over your life into a 401k and you will retire with enough to get by, you're going to F yourself. The tax exemption will offset inflation at best and you will have $700k at 65 if you're lucky."

91,"This is such a wholesome comment.  Thank you for what you said.  I tripped and fell into the insurance industry at 24.  (Workers' Compensation 😷)  Started as an Assistant, made a career out of it w/ no college degree.  Now 47,, an Adjuster, making very good salary.  Love my job? Nope.  Work M-F flex hours? Yep. I'm off every day at 3 pm.  Work from home 3 out of 5 days per week.  6 weeks vacation.  Great benefits.    Sexy? No.  Do I drink and smoke too much? Yes. 

But here is my wholesome comment back to you.  You can get there too! It is harder for your generation, I see you, I know it.  But you aren't behind the eight ball yet either.  Keep the Faith!  I am blessed I survived the mid 90's madness of my 20's.  And yet, I found a path to success, if not vocational fulfillment.  But, that's what those vacation days and retirement account are for.  
Good luck to you. You have time yet."
92,"Very true, in fact it's the more affluent peeps who can afford to travel who really spread it around from hotel to hotel & then back home again & then the people with less money who can't afford to totally exterminate them. Mattresses are expensive & poorer people really don't want to throw them away, and even if they do, bedbugs can live in nooks and crannies in a bedside table or even an electrical outlet. So disgusting. If I remember right, they can live almost a year without feasting on human blood.
Most of the pesticides were banned & they've also become resistant to them. One of the only ways to kill them is high heat, over 120°F for 20 minutes in a regular dryer. I guess there are services that come to your house and raise the temp to try to kill them all. Always put your luggage in the bathroom when you first get to a hotel, then go look under & on top of mattresses and pillows for dark little spots which would imply old dots of blood. It gives me the heebie-jeebies just thinking about it. I found this evidence at a nice hotel in Florida a couple years ago. I immediately brought my belongings to the front desk and told them. At first they were defensive and suggested that I brought them with, but called their bug guy who investigated and said they'd been there at least two weeks. They thanked me, then shut the whole floor down to exterminate & gave me a voucher for a week's stay to use later. "
93,"Modern tires last 80K miles and cost a few hundred dollars a set. They are under a penny a mile. Oil changes are similarly cheap.

> The state let you drive it tax-free? 

That is a fixed cost; if you are going to join the 90%+ of Americans as car owners, you get to pay this regardless of whether you are an uber driver.

Trucks are also some of the worst cars to go ubering with, so OP's point needs to be proven with an econobox, which are a lot cheaper. Less depreciation because the cars are just less valuable, etc. 

Uber drivers are not idiots; despite F-150s being the most common car in America, I have never been picked up in a F-150, presumably because they are expensive to run."
94,"Yep. Fuck taxi businesses and fuck taxi drivers. As someone who's traveled a lot, the amount of bullshit they pull is unreal. Lying about distance, lying about bus times, lying about safety of other means of getting somewhere, changing the cost after the trip, not running the meter, hiding the meter, running the meter up intentionally by taking a longer route, pretending they don't have change and therefore you should just pay the difference, rejecting rides because of destination, upcharging tourists for a trip that locals have said has a standard price. Literally I've experienced each and every one of these personally, and this as someone who takes cabs as a last resort. F-U-C-K T-A-X-I-S."
95,"I own a big Ford F-150 (guzzler), S2000 (premium fuel), and bicycle. I'm on the bicycle for all my commutes and half my grocery runs. Most liberating lifestyle change I made in the past year, and the bicycle paid itself off in gasoline/maintenance.


If you think your commute is too far for bicycle, reconsider your routes and health/lifestyle options. My workplace has a locker and shower, so if I ever move further away and sweat by arriving, I have that option. Most of us don't, but that's just a friendly reminder for those that do."

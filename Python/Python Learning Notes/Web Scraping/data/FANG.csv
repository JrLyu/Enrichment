0,I’m a FANG software dev and would love to help out anyway tech related that I can.
1,"Over a long enough time period every stock drops to zero.  I read about how Benjamin Franklin gave an endowment to the city of Boston, but only after it had compounded for 200 years.  I’m gonna do the opposite and give my country the rights to my FANG shorts.  If I don’t have to pay them, they’ll eventually be worth something a few decades from now.  In fact I’m going to do this with every short that doesn’t pay off now, just put the debt in a blind charitable trust that they can collect when it’s worth something.  It’s the governments problem now, but with less steps."
2,"CNBC literally counting us down to our earnings.

Last time I've seen them do this was FANG after their big run up and they all beat earnings by a mile.

Good sign, even if they are being condescending cunts while doing it lol"

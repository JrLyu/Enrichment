HOLD FASTâœ‹ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤š"
1,Man this place is turning into a cult FAST.
2,"I hope they process you guys FAST.

I've heard it can take 10+ days, who knows the actual #?

Edit: ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤²ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€"
3,Alamo Drafthouse does throwback nights like this and they sell out FAST. AMC needs to get onboard and do the same. Also charge normal bar prices for booze and reasonable prices for concessions. This will cause sales to go through the roof. Alamo has already proved that it works - get on board!
4,"NO ONE IS SELLING 
WE DO NOT HAVE THE POWER OR COORDINATION TO DROP THE PRICE THIS FAST
THIS IS MANIPULATION ALL OVER AGAIN"
5,"The retards who bought at 350+ the first time and didn't sell again today must have the bluest balls in the known universe 

TIS BUT A SCRATCH, BRAVE APES

HOLD FAST"
6,"Holding & buying every single day since the start. The pressure has been immense & learning a lot about others, myself  & friends. 

When things break, the men get separated from the boys, FAST.

All that  to say this, been saying it the last few weeks. It is the most important thing I can tell you if you believe in this short squeeze.

High volume days & they will break. If the buying demand is there, itâ€™s a wrap & matter of time thing.

I like the stock & DFV hit the nail on the head of GameStopâ€™s potential when  great leadership steps in.

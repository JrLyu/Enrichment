0,"Yeah, those things definitely happen, and you do have to contact your financial institution to fix it. Your FI should be able to issue you provisional credit until the ATM is balanced, though (mine does, anyway). "
1,I work at Financial Institution and have worked on several accounts that have fallen for these types of scams. We only tell the member they can't open another account with us if they have fallen for scams similar several times or caused a loss (I.e. We had to charge the acct off and didn't get the money paid back). If the returned check overdraws the acct we open the member another acct and they begin a payment plan with one of our collectors. This seems bizarre to me. Who is your FI?
2,"Just in case no one else does, I wanted to say that you're using the service smartly, and that I hope you continue to push your way to FI!  See you on the other side!"

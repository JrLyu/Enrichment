0,Suddenly feel like dumping my GE position.
1,"I've been hearing about the GE CEO dying this week. Apparently he was the innovator of mass layoffs in the 1980s. Before then, companies helped employees, customers, then shareholders. He changed it by focusing only on shareholders.

I'm not surprised small and midsized businesses don't like to layoff."
2,"Jack Welch felt he had to cut GE's workforce to remain competitive. GE had 411,000 employees at the end of 1980, and 299,000 at the end of 1985, according to him. Some of these were from selling off less profitable businesses but a lot were from him just firing the bottom 10% of managers. In a 'bloated' company like GE that may have been worthwhile for a time.

The really bad thing was that other companies started doing it but never got rid of the firing part. So companies like Microsoft would have different teams competing against eachother in cutthroat competition just to not be in that bottom percentile that gets fired/cut. So it got out of hand.

Also Welch didn't believe in climate change and a lot of people claimed the financial services companies owned by GE buoyed its wealth, especially when Welch's successor sold off massive GE assets after Welch retired."
3,"Some guy called in to Cramer worried about whether or not his plan to live off the dividends from $64K in GE shares would still be sound after the downturn.

Good shit."
4,"The ""perfect buys of 100"" thing is totally unreliable. Algos probably just buy in batches of 100 for any stock. [This](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amzn/latest-real-time-trades) is Amazon's latest trades. Tons of buys in multiples of 100. [GE](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/ge/real-time), just about the most boring stock I can think of, is also perfect batches of 100. I don't know where anyone is getting that orders of 100 mean it's manipulated. Yes, GME is probably manipulated out the ass, we know that, but the price might very well be dropping organically. AND THAT'S OKAY! That doesn't mean anything has changed in the market mechanics, that just means the price is going down. If the short squeeze is gonna squeeze, it'll squeeze at $300 or $30, it doesn't matter.

It is almost certain that Melvin and Co have covered their original shorts at $6 and re-shorted at the current price. They're betting the stock will go down enough and that people will lose interest so that they can cover their shorts over a very long period of time and still profit. I'm not saying the squeeze won't squoze, but in order for that to happen, all lenders must call back the shares they lent in a similar timeframe. With the amount that lenders are making on interest for this stock and the amount of collusion and corruption going on, I don't see that happening for a long long time. Melvin will gladly lose 25M a day for months if it means they don't liquidate their entire firm in full public view. VW was different, as the announcement that Porsche had locked up a high fraction of the public float meant that at the time of the squeeze, VW had a much higher short interest than GME.

I don't know why they're pushing silver so hard, but my only bet is that they're trying to direct mainstream attention and paper-hands away from GameStop so that this doesn't happen so publicly. Maybe they're trying to drive the price down enough to cover their new shorts and get out on top. These are smart guys, they know we plan on holding til we die. They've factored that into their decisions and are now doing with that what they are going to do anyway. What I'm trying to say is don't expect anything to happen for a while, if not ever. Hold, but know what you're holding."
5,"Well, it wasn't risk-free, obviously. I got into $SPWR when it was around $5.50. Then the split happened where I got $MAXN on top of what I had. Was pretty much all in there. Bought and sold $SPWR a couple of times trying to time the market but in the end said fuck it and just waited. Then it ran from $7 to over $20 + the $MAXN shares.

Now I'm hoping for something similar with another solar stock that I can't mention because mods delete micro caps. Sure, high-risk low-float but when it goes, it flies. Might lose a fair bit but I've put my initial investment into $GE where it's pretty much safe, so only the money I gained is in a somewhat high-risk stock."
6,"Synchrony, formerly GE Capital, is a shady ass credit card company. Source: I worked there"
7,"I absolutely despise Synchrony. I had a card from them before they decided to rebrand from GE Capital and they actively went out of their way to screw me over on multiple occasions. Outside of a random unnecessary charges that they would put onto my card, they also completely closed my account at one point while I was 300 miles from home because, as they claim, their servers got hacked. I didn't get notified until 2 weeks after when I was on vacation, and needed to get gas because I didn't have anymore cash on me. I literally had to call them to see why my card was declining before learning that it was closed and that's when they decided to send me a new one. Then, I had $5,000 worth of fraudulent charges put on to my card a year later after I had called them for the sole reason of closing my account. I stated the reason was that I not only had no use for the card anymore but also that I knew my ex had my credit card number and was going to make a shit ton of fraudulent transactions if I left that card number active.


I had to go through fighting them for 3 months with a dozen different excuses as to why my card wasn't closed, when it was supposedly reactivated, who reactivated it, and so on. Not once did I get a straight answer, let alone an answer that even remotely reflected what another person told me. No joke, their fraud department told me after 3 months of trying to get information, that I need to "" suck it up and take responsibility for my actions"" as though it's my fault they decided to not close my account, tell me that it was close, and ignore the fact that I told them that one of the main reasons why I am closing the account is because of a fraud risk. This was all despite the fact that my ex had flat-out admitted to the police that she was the one who did it and that I'm not at fault. I literally had to sue Synchrony Bank just so I could get them to take their own advice and take responsibility.


Synchrony is beyond unethical and they have no right being in business."

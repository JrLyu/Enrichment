0,"First, obviously, do what you want. But “afford” is a weird word to use when you can invest in fractions.

You have $500.

ABC Co. stock costs $1000 per share and XYZ Co. stock costs $20 per share

ABC = 1/2 share and XYZ = 25 shares

ABC goes up 10% = $50 profit (.5 x $100)
XYZ goes up 5% = $25 profit ($1 x 25)

SoooooOoo...thoughts. It’s not what you can afford, your investment in either is what you can afford. It’s the future growth of that investment that matters. GL"

0,GM everyone. buy and hold day is here
1,"Yep. I’m an AGM at a hotel who just gave his notice and my GM told me a story about another GM who worked at one of our sister properties and ended up burning every bridge imaginable when he quit. He landed another GM position at another hotel and a couple of years later, the hotel got bought out by, you guessed it, his former employer. Safe to say he’s no longer a GM"
2,"ROBINGTHEPOOR APP JUST BANNED USERS FROM BUYING MORE THAN 1 SHARE OF 50 COMPANIES INCLUDING STARBUCKS, GM, American Airlines,  its not only nok, gme , amc etc being targeted. everyone needs to get their money out of robingthepoor immediately, but don't sell GME, transfer it if possible?  please guys delete robinhood off your phones find new brokers immediately. Please upvote this so everyone sees and spread the news. I think the whole stock market except GME will crash in February."
3,"Yeah, people buying into the group mentality is worrying me. I'm not looking forward to two weeks time when a bunch of people who dropped hundred of dollars into shares without any DD suddenly realise they lost a lot of money and start making ""what do I do now?"" posts.

Some people are that dumb that I made 3-4% on GM shares because people didn't even know what they were buying and started investing in the motor company.

I also think OP genuinely means don't try and organise too. That's just going to cause its own problems for the sub and retail traders as a whole."
4,There's some theories floating around along the same lines  when GM releases a new Hummer... The stars are aligning...
5,"I think there is some misunderstanding about this. The $25B that GME is worth or $47B the float is worth at $1000 per share might sound like a lot of money. But these short selling hedge fund fucks have way way more money than that and so do the brokerages and banks. When it comes time to buy out their short positions, I guarantee they will come up with the money. The hedge funds may have to liquidate some of their long positions or borrow some more money from Citadel, but they will do it. For those of your worried that you have some of your pension or your 401k in stocks that might get sold off. Even if we are talking about $100 billion ($2000 a share for GME) or let’s get crazy here, $500 billion ($10,000 a share, 30X where we are now), we are talking about $500 billion compared to $50 TRILLION dollars of total US market stock capitalization. For those good at math, that’s a measly 1%. Yes if the hedge funds liquidate some positions in GM or AAPL or whatever their price will take a very small temporary dip, but everyone else who didn’t have to liquidate will snatch it up while it’s on sale. So don’t let these assholes tell you that if you buy GME it will somehow wreck the stock market and entire financial system, that’s just them trying to scare you."
6,They need to wipe out shareholders.  GM bailout or Citi equity dilution killed shareholders while saving the company.
7,AAL went bankrupt in 2011. GM in 2009. These companies just get restructured. Anyone thinking bailing out a company will save jobs is out of their minds.
8,"GM recently announced that by 2035, aka 14 years from now, they are going to stop making combustible engines and going full in on electric vehicles. 

The future is here."
9,"Please for the love of all that is holy. Make sure you understand the Chinese market before dipping your toes. Literally the Senior Panda himself could just eradicate the company on the markets. The first rule about China is don't believe anything coming out of China. 

While China is a big market it is a horribly xenophobic market. Just ask GM and Ford who have had their tech copied and resold.

And don't forget if you think you are talking to a Chinese shill just ask about the  Tiananmen Square protests and massacre and see if they suddenly stop responding."
10,"I graphed these yesterday against price action for the last 10 years..

11,Calls on GM
12,"The fact he thought Nikola and GM had ""merged"" is scary enough."
13,I consider myself somewhat of a car guy and I had no idea that Mercedes discounts that much - it's almost as bad as GM.

I'm not sure how we get out of here without something really big happening."
1,Has anyone looked at the one month chart for GOOGL? She should have held on regardless.
2,"12/20 GOOGL closed at 89.02. On 12/21 and 12/28 the other two days she traded it closed at 89.58 and 86.02 respectively. 

Today it closed at 95.22. 

1. I don’t think the DOJ would ever leak this info to anyone in Congress

2. Even if they did, Pelosi clearly didn’t profit off of it, she lost money on it lol"
3,Yup. It also took me 2 seconds to see that the days she sold GOOGL the stock price was actually LOWER than it is today… so this wasn’t some amazing insider move…

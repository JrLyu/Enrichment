1,"TBH no idea. You could kind of explain the last peak with the high GME short interest, even though in retrospect it looks a lot like bubble buying. I personally find it hard to navigate the data nowadays as it's a lot unclearer than a few weeks ago.

Some things are sure:

1) GME is a lot less shorted than in January
2) The majority of shareholders are institutions

What does this mean? Large shift in prices are not cause by retail investors or at least can't snowball as easily as a few weeks ago. 

What happened yesterday? Gamma squeeze. We have seen the same 3 times with GME in the recent past, once with the huge increase and then the large drop back down under the level before the GS. 
This seems very likely as a scenario again, as the increase was very drastic. I do not know what had to cover however.
Personally I think it is going to slowly correct itself downwards today and tomorrow again how ever, retail has experience in these shifts now so there will be less panic selling. This might mean that the overall price level will shift upwards in comparison to yesterday's open by a good deal.

To conclude: No fucking idea. It could be anything and it is a complete casino right now. If you want to invest, invest money you can lose. Don't buy because you think you are missing out. If you say that you want to gamble then go ahead and gamble. 
Rationally, at least based on the data I have seen, there is no real explanation."

3,"So I did a quick digging in on my own to support the authors claim. These data are all publicly available on the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), what I simply did was to aggregate them by month and looked at the percentage of fail to deliver shares as a proportion of the float based on the yahoo finance. I picked a couple of companies which are 'hot' on WSB now and also some large caps that have been under heavy shorting such as TSLA and AAPL. GS was also chosen to see how things look like for large banks with their own clearing house.

As you can see in the two graphs below, the percentage of fail to deliver for GME is through the roof for the past year. Even for heavily shorted stocks like TSLA, the percent of shares that failed to deliver is extremely low throughout 2020.

In terms of the total number of shares, it is clear that there is a lot of naked shorting and a ridiculous number of shares failed to deliver over the course of 2020.

The fact that this data is publicly available from SEC and that SEC has not acted upon it is beyond my comprehension. Then again I'm only a retard who loves GME and will hold it to infinity and beyond. And please don't be a smart ass and start buying other companies. Hold on and buy GME, this house needs some cleaning up. Screw the central banks for printing so much money and allowing the whole financial system to become as blatantly corrupt as it as become.

4,"A YouTuber I follow likened it to a game of musical chairs, where there‚Äôs only one seat left and if the shorts don‚Äôt get it, the upside is theoretically infinite. Doesn‚Äôt matter how much money these institutions and clearinghouses have; ultimately big banks like GS and JPM would be the ultimate bag-holders. The Scary (Hilarious) part of this whole thing is that, with theoretical unlimited upside - It could potentially wreck either or both of those institutions.

Another thing that bothers me is that if things started pushing price levels so ludicrous that they issue a prolonged halt pending an investigation - would our shares be worth be worth anything seeing as some may be ‚Äúcounterfeit‚Äù"
5,"You guys are doing the coolest shit that I have ever seen , I might be one of the only 45 year olds around this platform and I am blown away. I remember getting one of those small hand held orange fold screen Donkey Kongs as a kid -!that‚Äôs how old my ass is. For all the peeps who missed out on buying the stock at around $100 what is the next company to get some serious Reddit love? This would help those  who can not afford the $300 pricing , earn cash from another co and buy in to GS. Just another thought , imagine their was a listed company that used a small portion of their profits to decrease world hunger. Let‚Äôs say that company had a $500 million or $1 Billion market cap. Let‚Äôs then say that that company had a manifesto that when their stock price increased  they would then increase the portion of money they gave towards stopping world hunger. Pull another GS scenario with this idea and have a great shot at minimizing  world hunger in a big way. The idea is not refined or smooth in the least but it‚Äôs worth a twirl."

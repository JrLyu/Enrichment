1,"Fidelity wants proof of bank information, says it will take 4-7 days to process.

Please, if anybody knows, there HAS to be a broker that lets you open an account, transfer funds, and buy shares on day 1 that hasn't banned these stocks yet.

Edit: Trying to log back into Fidelity to try wire method, I enabled 2FA which was apparently a mistake. I'm not getting a text for 2FA. Fun times.

Edit 2: Got in, but the can't wire transfer deposits, only withdrawals from Fidelity to my bank. Just will have to wait, I guess. Fuck RH, fuck Cash App."

3,"Hi. Retired boomer here. I lost about half of my 401K in the dot .com bubble. I never recovered that loss, but I kept plugging money away because that is how you plan and save for the future. I lost about the same proportion again in 2008, about half. It fucking sucked, and my income went down too when all overtime was eliminated. NO ONE WAS HELD ACCOUNTABLE. NO ONE. Crimes of gigantic proportions were committed, and WE HAD TO PAY FOR THEM ... I never recovered that loss either. Yes, I kept investing, because that is still important for the future. Having said that, YOU BEAUTIFUL WSB's!!! HOLD THE LINE AND CLAIM BACK WHAT HAS BEEN ROBBED.   DO. NOT. FUCKING. GIVE. UP.     DO. NOT. LET. THEM. FRIGHTEN. YOU.

15,"God I miss the old WSB.

The WSB where everyone was in pure option plays for an earnings play or long-term play, and we'd laugh at the fucking idiot who had a week to go on his 1 yr call option, sitting at -95%... Only for that mother fucker to hit 300% on that very friday.

WSB'ers know the game. They know what it's like to be hurting, squeezing for adding in more margin, getting in that last contract even though you're a blow away from GUHing your future. Know what we'd do? ""Just delete the app, restart!""

You morons are crying about going down 30 and 40%? No. You're already a paper holding F*G**T. If you didn't have the confidence of knowing that you may be down 80% tomorrow, but will be up 300% at the end of the week, then you shouldn't of been in this trade in the first place.

This is a kind of trade financial advisors scream at you for doing because its idiotic, foolhardy, and plain retarded. That's why this will *work*. BUT ONLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME BEING PLAYED.

So shut up about your paper handing bullshit because no one wants to hear it. The OG's have been through it, we've all suffered bigger losses before, but the reason it's an echo chamber is because THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AS SURE OF A THING THAN RIGHT NOW! So pull that dildo out of your asshole you gay bear and BUY $GME"

*THEY* ARE PULLING A HUNT BROTHERS!

Look i'm not saying don't buy GME. By all means please do. I'm on your side. Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

But i'm TELLING you! The mining deficit is real! The suppression of the gold and silver price is REAL! There has been delivery wall after delivery wall since April 2020 on the Comex. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THAT! We even have signs that the LBMA is running out:

Look at that it's from 2 weeks ago, LONG before there was talk about any of this. It's from a good friend that's been fighting this fight for a decade as well.

Trust me. Feel free to read through any of my articles. I KNOW they've been screwing you, better then you do:

This is a manipulated dip just like the MASSIVE DIP that happened in VW just before the big squeeze. They are trying to get us to sell to bring the price down before the FRENZY OF BUYING that is covering shorts. THERE IS STILL 120% SHORT INTEREST you fucking retards. HOLD STRONG. I am buying this dip tomorrow as long as webull clears my goddam recent deposit"
32,This guy HAS to be trolling hard. No way someone takes the time to spell like that. Some sentences make perfect sense while others are so “extra”. Pleeez kid!
33,"PSA: FOR ANYONE WHO CANNOT BUY GME STOCK BECAUSE TRADING 212 HAS STOPPED ALLOWING BUY ORDERS

It is absolutely disgraceful and reprehensible that Trading 212 is not allowing people to buy shares in GME. This is market manipulation to the core. Thankfully, there are a couple of ways around it.

1. Currently, it is possible to purchase GME shares on Trading 212 via the German market, instead of the NYSE. If you search 'GS2C' in the T212 search bar you will find GME under the DE and will be able to purchase shares. However, it is possible that T212 will catch on and limit people buying shares on this market as well. This takes me to the next solution.
2. Download a different broker app - FreeTrade allows one to make an account incredibly quickly and easily. You will need a pro account to make trades, which costs 9.99 a month, however you will make plenty more from trading GME stock. Furthermore, you will not be charged until February 3rd anyway so you can still opt out by that time.

Today I was trying to make new accounts in various apps and FreeTrade gave me the least hassle - I didn't have to go through leaps and bounds to make an account. I am in no way affiliated to FreeTrade it is just what I found best when trying to buy more GME stock today.

This is not financial advice.

Detach yourself from this artifical price. If you've done your DD, you know and believe in the stock and where it's headed (ANDROMEDA). Retail owns the float and controls the price shorties have to buy back at, it can go as high as retail wants as long as retail HODLs. Expect there to be fuckery with GMEs price, especially today. Expect the media to twist the earnings in favour of shorties. Expect the worst, because this is the game they are playing, this is psychological warfare. Always remember, RETAIL OWNS THE FLOAT RETAIL CONTROLS EVERYTHING, don't panic. In short, I like the stock. Not financial advice"

But there HAS to be well-placed trust. I would not recommend this advice to most people."
51,"I used to work for AOL and this happens ALL THE TIME.

If you haven't called yet, honestly, make it sound like your father is pretty much senile and had this set from when he was using it and since then hasn't touched a computer...we're ""taught"" that you use the terms of service and that you should be managing your finances so it really isn't up to AOL to monitor your usage or your finances.

They CAN do a credit back to the card, don't let them say otherwise, BUT DO NOT MENTION ANY LAWYERS...the minute you do that, they have to refer you to legal and the conversation stops. 

ALSO, DO NOT CANCEL THE ACCOUNT UNTIL AFTER A REFUND HAS BEEN SUBMITTED. If you do, it locks the CSR out of the account and you can't get anything back. You MIGHT be able to get a years worth of AOL refunded back to your card, but I wouldn't hope for much more.

Dear God if there was ever a time you read all the comments to your post...let it be this."

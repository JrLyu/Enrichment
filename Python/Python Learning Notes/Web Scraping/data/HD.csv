1,"These are the insane cable TV monopoly antics I don't miss since I moved out of the US. In Seoul I've got 100gb internet and HD cable for $25/mo. It has nothing to do with lower cost of living. (Damn it's expensive here.) It's all about competition. I have no fewer than five ISPs and cable companies to select among, and if I'm still not satisfied there's always satellite TV and free public WiFi."
2,"Saw this happen myself and it was ridiculous. New customer signup with a massive discount including free HD box rental because he lived in an apartment building that had a contract with us. 

There was a shortage on HD boxes, so they were giving out 4K boxes (which can run 1080p as well) instead. But, because his discount only worked with HD boxes, adding a 4K box to his account threw all sorts of errors. 

Not only would he lose his free rental (through no fault of his own, he didn't even want a 4K box), the system wouldn't let us activate his account. At all. I couldn't even add it on the system and apply a reoccurring discount...it simply would not let me process it. 

I elevated the issue as high as I could and was told it is ""physically impossible"" to activate his account. Wtf? It's just a different model receiver box than is on the building contract, but in order to activate his box they would have to allow ALL contracted buildings to allow 4K boxes.

Nevermind the fact that anytime our system was down or slow, we had to tell the customer that it was ""down for system upgrades."" The level of outright lying that we were expected to do was way too much and I quit shortly after. Out of my ""class"" of 22 people only 6 still work there."
3,"Better yet, take HD video of everything! You'll probably catch things you'd miss otherwise."
4,"The Tesla will record HD video all around it at all times while it is parked, provided it has enough storage and enough battery."
5,"The few friends I've told ""I'm about to buy a(another) new truck"" have kind of scoffed at the idea.  I own a construction business and haul heavy shit every day.  Any time my truck is down I lose money.  I've put 74k miles on a 2016 Sierra HD.  Over the next 30k miles I'm looking at crank case, radiator fluid, spark plugs caliper, ball joint, and strut replacement; new tires, trans fluid, and transfer case fluid, the list goes on.  Whatever it costs for a car, basically multiply it by 3 for a heavy duty truck.  Since it's American made, who knows when the transmission will shit the bed or it'll blow a head. My guess is as soon as the warranty expires.  So I can either spend $8k on preventative maintenance over the next year, be out thousands bc my trucks in the shop for over a week and still have a truck with 100k+ miles, or I can trade my truck in plus $14k and have something with 0 miles, 100k mile warranty and next to no down time.  
The easy decision was made even easier with the new body style."
6,Why are you shitting on American made? The transmission in the HD Sierra's are pretty bullet proof. Is it a gas or diesel? Why would you have to replace the crankcase?

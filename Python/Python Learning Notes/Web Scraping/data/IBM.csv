TYPE IN ANY RANDOM STOCK AND LOOK THROUGH AND YOU WILL SEE A BUNCH BLOCK TRADES IN 100s. IT'S COMMON PRACTICE. I LOOKED AT $PFE, $F, $IBM - THEY ALL LOOK LIKE $GME."
1,Another perspective  about diversification I agree with is that it's selling the winner to buy the losers. Why sell Apple to diversify with IBM or HP or dell? Why sell Tesla to diversify with other manufacturers? It's admitting you  have no idea what you are doing so you go with all the choices instead of few or one good choices.

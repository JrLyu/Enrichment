0,"I am extending the offer again!! WE HIT $350 TODAY, I WILL ORDER PIZZA, SODA AND ICE CREAM FOR MY LOCAL GAMESTOP!!! ALSO WHOEVER IS WORKING GETS $200 A PIECE!!!

1,Honestly improvements in video conference software and bandwidth have probably taken more ICE cars off the road than any conversion to electric.
2,"Tesla pretty much single handedly forced mass adoption of EVs by all major automakers to accelerate by who knows how many years/decades. In my mind that is the biggest environmental impact Tesla has made. I’m not an Elon or Tesla die hard by any means, but you have to give credit where credit is due. And while I agree with the environmental impact that lithium mining and shipping for EVs has, don’t use that to say that EVs are not really good for the environment as if those things don’t also apply to ICE autos. Oil and gas production, shipping, and refinement is far worse."

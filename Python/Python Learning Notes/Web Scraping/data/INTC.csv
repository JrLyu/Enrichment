GO FOR INTC"
1,"[I thought it was LEAPS that they were loss harvesting.](https://twitter.com/PelosiTracker_/status/1552299246065442820) The position definitely didn't make money and CHIPS doesn't benefit NVDA as much as IDMs like INTC and other fab suppliers. NVDA can write off some of it's validation footprint, but they don't manufacture chips or much board volume."

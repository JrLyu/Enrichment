0,"The GME long-term hold depends on cost basis. The people who got in a few weeks ago at $10-15/share definitely have long term possibility as it will probably settle into the $100 range for a while with the perceived ecommerce direction with Ryan Cohen coming on board. Those in at $200+ will have to think harder about their position after the squeeze. 

I think BB has the best long term perspective to grow from its current price given their IP and all of that. As a short squeeze, not so much. The float is really high and we can pressure hedge funds to lose money on interest by pushing the dates further and further out, but it's still under 100% so they can cut losses and close those positions if they want."
1,"I have managed to really talk to one of these scammers after we both agreed that I knew he was not the IRS and that he knew he wasn't getting anywhere with me.   I asked him if he treated his work like a real job and he really believed his work is real.  Like any type of job, he had metrics to meet (# of calls to make per day); certain revenue quotas per moth (via those 7-11/Walgreens money cards); he even takes a 1/2 for lunch break with a boxed lunch that is delivered to him from his wife via a sophisticated lunch deliver system in the city he works in.  He said he has his own IP phone in a cubicle with a picture of his family.  "
2,Honestly I hope fidelity buys their IP on the cheap and they get a dope trading app.
3,"The other problem underlying stagnation is that it is really hard to unseat inefficient huge companies if you just make the same product or service. 

It takes a lot of effort and importantly, money, to start a company from the ground up. Second, lenders are not very eager to invest in the new company that just wants to be X but better. Nobody will invest in a new car tire manufacturer if their tagline is Continental but more efficient, so the only ways to compete are to bootstrap using savings, which very few people can do, or create a significantly better innovation. 

The very people best suited to creating that new product are probably engineers who work at that very company and that runs into the next problem. 

If you try to enter into the main line of business as these major companies, get ready to get sued a million times, since they have the capital and all the incentive in the world to drag you down with legal fees and our courts now don't give a fuck about justice, just who has more money. Or Apple will just rip off your invention and steal IP. Oh, you sue them? Guess what, the courts aren't interested in penal fines and will just make the huge corp pay your watered down ""loss"", not an excess of the loss to be punitive and disincentivize IP theft by large firms, while they keep market share and dont allow you to buils your brand."
4,It’s like back when Sony only licensed Spider-Man when they could have had the rest of the marvel IP for like 33% more.  Just go with it bro.
5,Or just better yet IP ban them both
6,Can we ban his IP from reddit completely?
7,"The cost of giving YOU a raise might be worth it. But the cost of potentially adjusting the salary of everyone you work with or adjusting the long term department budgets might not be worth it. Especially when they can just give your work to someone else and distribute your load across several people (or just dump it all on someone else).

I once worked at a well known market research firm. I presented my own company's research around the cost of losing employees (loss of IP, downtime, training time, opportunity cost, morale impact, etc) to my boss after a raise request was denied when I was getting a promotion.

They basically shrugged their shoulders, said ""it's a great opportunity that will really set you up down the road...and 5 other people want it if you don't. You want the job, or not?"". 

I took it and left the second I learned enough to get a 50% raise elsewhere. And they knew it was going to happen, but they got the 18 months out of me that they knew I'd put in."
8,"Finally, some serious DD that is much more than simply ""HOLD"" and ""If DFV is in, I'm in.""

I'm a retard so I'm still holding on to 10 shares of GME at $350. That's my next month's rent that I'm prepared to not get back. Will have to go suck some you know what behind the 7-11 to tie me through the next few weeks. 

But seriously, my biggest question is this. The stock went from $40 to $483 in 5 trading session with the biggest jump, $76 to $483 in 2 sessions. And that $40 is already up from $4 back in August. That is a stock that went 100x in less than 6 months. 

People comparing to VW, it took a year of build up to squeeze that stock price from ~100 euro to 1000 euro at the peak. That was 10x. And VW was a better run company with actual IP, brand, and value, relative to its peers than GME (brick and mortar retailer trying to transition to e-commerce) currently. 

So we have already seen a 10x larger price jump in half of the time compared to VW. 

So why do people keep saying that the short squeeze hasn't happened yet?"
9,The kid should've taken the 5k and started a new account from another IP address
10,I've worked at a huge game company before the surprise launch of a new IP. There were people working on that two desks over. I did not know about it at all until release. You underestimate how important confidentiality is taken.
11,Requires EU bank or just IP address?
12,"Reposting from about a year ago. I was targeted with scary determination.

I got hit by this, as well. First time, it was because I stupidly hadn't changed a few passwords in years, and it was the same email+password combo that got pwned a while back through one of the many hacks & breaches. They ordered some electronics (iPhones, a drone, etc) on eBay, and then two items from the Canon online store for ~$15,000.

The first time, I was able to get everything cancelled before it hit my bank account, but one lens from Canon actually shipped out. I started researching the shipping address that was listed, and was shocked to find it was a real place within a half hour of my house, with the name listed matching publicly available records.

As part of the cleanup process I filed a report with the police and a detective began an investigation. She went to the address and left a note since no one was home, and the residents called back confused and wanting to know what was going on. She also took the information I had from the FedEx delivery that was signed for at the address and planned on talking with the driver.

I had all of my passwords changed and accounts updated, and thought I was in the clear. 

Then, a week later, I got hit again. This time, they compromised my email and LastPass account. This was baffling to me considering I had 2-factor authentication turned on for both of those. That's when I discovered a keylogger on my desktop computer. That still didn't explain how they'd accessed my accounts, since just having the password wouldn't work -- they'd need to get through the second factor authentication.

I started digging deeper and ended up discovering in my Windows user account logs in the Event Viewer that they'd actually logged in via Windows Remote Desktop -- because I had RDP open on my router and forwarded to my desktop, so plugging my IP address into an RDP client would send them right there. Then, plug in a password that was pwned long ago, and you've accessed my desktop computer where I'm already logged in to my email and LastPass account. They did this around 2am on a weekday night to avoid being detected.

They then went through my LastPass account and tried to access those accounts. I know this because later, when I'd recovered my accounts, I went through the account history recorded in the Google Account and was able to see what websites were visited in Chrome. They tried to find my credit union based on text of the entry in LastPass but couldn't find the right website (thank fuck). They tried to log in to outdated student loan and payroll accounts, too. Really terrifying shit.

The end result is that I was able to recover my accounts and get everything cancelled before they were shipped. PayPal fucked up their records at some point, though, and threatened to send my account into collections. I had to send them screenshots showing them where my bank account had been debited the amounts of the charges that I reversed before they were able to get it corrected on my account.

I wasn't able to recover my LastPass account. They disabled the account as soon as I was able to provide some proof of identity, but could not change the new log in email address and password -- instead, they terminated & deleted the account entirely. In a stroke of luck, my phone happened to still be logged in to LastPass, so I was able to export my vault to make it easier to identify compromised sites and change the passwords.

I consider myself pretty security oriented, using 2 factor authentication whenever I can. I use LastPass so that I can use a unique, strong password for everything. I never expected that someone would target me by logging in to my desktop, installing a keylogger, and accessing my password manager in the middle of the night.

It was a huge wakeup call and I run a much tighter ship, now.

The detective working my case recently called and left a voice mail when I wasn't available to answer the call. Her words: ""I spoke to the subject that received the camera lens today in [town] and apparently this couple has been scammed. There's a company out of Russia that hired them through the internet, and they use stolen credit card numbers, and they have the item shipped to these people and these people ship it out.""

Unreal."
13,"Two factor solves about 99% of security issues at some point in the chain believe it or not. That's until they are so deep that they are intercepting your two factor codes.

But yeah, someone has your password for amazon. If it's reused this is almost 100% the reason. Probably came from a dump. The other reasons are getting  emailed malware and getting backdoored. 

If they had access to your email they'd just delete your orders, not mail bomb you... unless they are amateurs. You can also check your login IPs if the right level of logging is happening in your mail system. You can confirm/dent what IP and cou tries your legit user would have been logging in from."
14,"What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo."

I'm of the opinion that a one-star review with the following comment is nice, but I think you should do whatever review you want:

""RobinHood will censor you and other working-class people like you. Do not support this brokerage.""

Also, **FUCK IT, I'M HOLDING**"
1,"AND IT IS THE STRONGEST BUY SIGNAL EVER!!!

We are close to breaking through the shorts!"
2,"Listen guys, I don't trade or anything, but I've been following this story.

*You guys* are the real Robin Hoods. It warms my heart to seen real people finally punching back. I never thought I would see it happen, much less that memes would be the vehicle for it, but here we are. KEEP FUCKING STICKING IT TO 'EM!!!

Do it for all of us."
3,IT FITS NICELY
4,"GET THIS FUCKING (speculative) DD OUT THERE:

&#x200B;

Guys think about what is REALLY happening here!!

The hedge funds dont matter that much, yes they are the degenerates that think every trade they make will never go tits up. The reason this trade is working is because SHARES THAT DONT EVEN EXIST HAVE BEEN SHORTED!!

Who made this risky ass loan (because shorting shares is borrowed shares meaning loaned)???

Why are brokerages restricting/suspending trading shares/options/ANYTHING related to the underlying? They shouldn't give a fuck if you lose money right? THEY ARE THE ONES WHO ARE AT RISK!!! THEY MADE RISKY FUCKING LOANS THINKING IT CANT GO TITS UP.

This is why GME is the only play, its the only one shorted above 100% float!! THEY ARE CAUGHT WITH THERE FUCKING PANTS DOWN AND ARE DESPERATE TO NOT GET CAUGHT.

WASSUP LEIMAN BROS!!!??!?!

Ahem. Not financial advice, I just like commenting on shit and love this stock"
5,"this is the way, we will end their onslaught by giving them nothing but continued support for each other and knowing they can't use our own words against us. WE WILL DIAMOND HANDS AND SQUEEZE THEM UNTIL THEY ARE SQUOZE AND THERE IS NOTHING THEY CAN DO TO STOP IT <3"
6," 

So, let‚Äôs just rewind a few days. Thursday, they executed a ladder attack, trading large stock holdings between themselves, gradually lowering the offering each time. What did this do? Trick the market algorithms into thinking there was a mass sell off! Was there really? Fuck no. Did we sell? Fuck no! Did we hold? Fuck yes! üíéü§≤üèªüíéü§≤üèª

In the hours following their futile attempt of BLATANT ILLEGAL MARKET MANIPULATION, the stock rose again to +300, an honest representation of the situation, because none of us retards sold!!!

The corrupts at wall street have had the entire weekend to think of a strategy to keep us at bay. Trying to create hype about silver to distract us, using their media contacts to distort the narrative, scaremongering... has it worked? Fuck no!

What they are now doing is using a reduced form of laddering to keep the main stocks at bay. In other words they will continue to trade between themselves at a level that will keep the stock stagnant. This will be a futile attempt to deceive us that the game is up (excuse the pun) and that the squeeze is over.

People, the squeeze is just getting started! It has barley begun! They will do EVERYTHING in their power to come out on top. The amount of blatant illegal acts they committed last week proves this. There are literally no rules they will not break on their quest to cause panic and ultimately get us retards to sell our stock.

They are continuing to drive the price down now aftermarket in attempt to create further panic so that people sell tomorrow. This is exactly what they want. DO NOT FALL FOR IT!!!

HERE IS THE IMPORTANT PART; No matter what people say, what you hear in the media or any other form of bullshit distraction...

THEY CANNOT CLOSE THEIR POSITIONS UNLESS WE SELL. Simple as that. It‚Äôs mathematics. The short float is more than the physical amount of existing shares. Bottom line.

They can‚Äôt get out of this without buying the shares back. And who controls the price at which the buy back? WE DO!

Everyone just take a step back, chill out, block out the noise and absolutely 100% hold every bit of stock you own. We are winning here. It really is that simple.

If everyone can stay cool and follow this advice, we got this.

Please upvote, share etc. Don‚Äôt care about karma or anything this is far more important. The message needs to be spread so that we can do what‚Äôs necessary and finally get ours. We‚Äôve spent too long being oppressed by this corrupt system. It‚Äôs time for change.

GME & AMC are the main focus. Anything else is a distraction.

LETS DO THIS!!! üíéü§≤üèªüíéü§≤üèªüíéü§≤üèª"
7,"GOT IT, BUY MOOR"
8,IT SMELL LIKE BITCH IN HERE
9,"I'm with you so much. 

I'm so fucking tired of these fuckers winning. I'm so tired of no consequences, of rules that are only for the 99% and never for the 1%. 

I watched my dad stress over his 401k during the .com bust of the late 90s (but he was an OG diamond hands and held strong!). Then lived through the hell of 9/11 and watched as our government utilized that to trample upon our civil liberties (Patriot Act, anyone?) for the next two decades. After that, I graduated college during the Great Recession of '08 and while I was pretty fortunate to grab a job in tech, I watched so many of my friends flounder for *years* trying to start a career in less resilient industries while these fuckwits like Melvin profitted off all of it. Now as I'm trying to start a family with my spouse, I have to deal with a global pandemic, no doubt exacerbated by DJT and his servitude to the 1%. I'm locked up in my fucking house, isolated from my own family for a year plus now, just lost my uncle to a very abrupt and unexpected COVID death, and seeing so many out there struggling financially, mentally, emotionally... and I am just FUCKING SICK OF ALL OF IT. And I realize that despite all that, I am still way more privileged than so very many. 

I'm angry for me but I'm MORE ANGRY for those who are even more powerless against the powers that be than I am. And I'm fighting for them too. I have to. We have to. WE are the ones with some fucking shred of morality left.

I am holding my position in GME. It's about principle. It's about the 99% starting to realize that we have a *fighting chance* to not spend the rest of our lives being completely and utterly steamrolled by these greedy boomer pricks, if we see ourselves as a collective and not as individuals.

I, for one, am not going to spend the rest of my life hearing about avocado toast and Starbucks purchases being the downfall of millennial/Gen Z's financial futures... while these ass clown Boomers have wrecked basically fucking everything from the environment to the financial world to actual human rights and dignity... all to make a goddamn buck. And had the audacity to tsk tsk at *us* all along, as if we EVER had the power or the control that they did.

GME $1000 let's fucking go. We like the stock. We like to say FUCK YOU."
10,"I was little when the recession hit, but I remember bits and pieces. I remember my grandparents losing their car dealerships, my dad losing his job at said dealerships, my Mom returning to work as a teacher. I didn't know the extent to how bad things were until recent years. I remember one day in freshman year of high school, I was having a mental and emotional breakdown. My dad leveled with me in a way he never had before. He admitted to me that when we lost the dealerships, he went on unemployment, and things were getting pretty bad. He admitted to me (something I don't even think he told my mother) that he was extremely close to just getting into a ""car accident"" and supporting us with his life insurance.

I've had the fortune of not actually seeing him in that state, and I intend to keep it that way. I'm not a tankie or anything, I fully believe in and support capitalism, but I genuinely hope these mushroom dick bankers and pig fuckers on Wall Street choke on my testicles. I don't like to believe that people in this world are cartoonishly evil, but I know these knob-slobbering chodes have absolutely no problem demolishing the lives of millions just so they can get another yacht.

And I really hope this is it, I really hope this is the beginning of a takedown of these predatory miscreants. I pray that this isn't just some blip in history where a bunch of assholes on the internet made a mess of things. This will be a revolution in which the masses reap their rewards. Not from violence and riots, not from meaningless protests that make school kids think they're revolutionaries, not from the government making taxes and legislation, but from *SHEER. UNADULTERATED. AUTISM.* WE'LL TAKE BACK WHATS OURS BY TAKING THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE FREE MARKET, MAKING IT INTO A FIST, AND SHOVING UP THEIR ASS! SORRY MR. HEDGE FUND MANAGER, BUT YOU ARE GONNA LOSE ALL YOUR MONEY! YOUR GONNA HAVE TO GO WITHOUT HOOKERS FOR A WHILE CAUSE ITS GONNA BE US WHO WILL BE FUCKING THE WHORES WITH TENDIES SHOWERING DOWN ON US!

12,"See how come he can post that but I can‚Äôt post:

CAN WE MAKE SURE WE DONT ‚ÄúGO PRIVATE‚Äù AGAIN. OR CAN ELON MUSK / DAVE PORTNOY BUILD US A WSB FREEDOM OF SPEECH PLATFORM NOT USING AMAZON WEB SERVICES. FUCK IT ALL.

1. We create our own social media company. 
2. Chamath takes it public via SPAC.
3. Elon Musk designs the architecture & infrastructure and where AI can detect genuine bots in real time on a platform where we don‚Äôt have to worry about George Orwell‚Äôs 1984 ‚ÄúThought Police.‚Äù AKA Big Tech, Intelligence Communities, Wall Street, Hollywood, Politicians raping us of our civil liberties and rights. 

Enough is enough. Chamath. Elon. Portnoy. Is Kanye West in here?

Make some moves. Guard free speech. Guard Americans from rigged stock markets.

Don‚Äôt you think all this retail investing and volume will go away once we all are really shown behind the curtain just how rigged the game is. 

CNBC proved yesterday and today that we have a rigged stock market. They did this though not by telling us; but by showing us in the way in which they behaved live on air; Andrew Ross Sorkin‚Äôs vagina aching; speaking down, or talking down, to us like we are all peasants. 

Fuck that. 

Fuck them.

If they think they can just move goal post & cheat and get away with it like a rigged election, not this time. Not with my $GME calls. 

Now when for once in American History, David has proven he can defeat Goliath. Hedge Funds are imposing CIA perception management intelligence tactics in the media about WSB promoting hate speech, what they aren‚Äôt reporting is it‚Äôs really the hedge funds or friends in intelligence communities funding that fake racist white supremacist stuff via bots, to make us look bad. CIA 101. 

This is their playbook. Infiltration of otherwise. Destroy sides reputation. And bounce.

Fuck them all!

17,"Fuck all those wall street cunt bags. For me, it was initially about making a couple bucks on a meme stock - I figured hell, WSB hasn't led me astray too bad so why not.

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them.

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî> price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Now. Don't worry if we don't squeeze tomorrow. Don't worry if we don't squeeze monday. In 2008 the short attack lasted almost 2 trading weeks before the squeeze happened. With shit being frozen today for retail, hedges were able to open new positions. There is a high chance they made a lot of money today. They maybe bought another few days of capital to try to pay the interest on their shorts.

Just remember we can hold longer then they can pay the interest on their shorts. It is killing them we've all been seeing the numbers. Billions a day. But DO NOT GET DISCOURAGED IF IT DOES NOT POP TOMORROW. WE CAN STAY HOLDING LONGER THEN THEY CAN STAY SOLVENT"

The squeeze probably will NOT happen today. All we will see is options expiring. This will drive the price up. DON'T BE FOOLED THOUGH. This won't be the real squeeze yet! That will probably happen next week.

THEY WILL RELEASE A PRESS STATEMENT AT 9AM, IT WILL ALL BE LIES, DONT BE FOOLED BY IT. DONT LISTEN TO THE MEDIA. HOLD YOUR FUCKING GROUND.

On top of this there will be HUGE SHORT LADDER attacks all throughout the day. DONT BE FOOLED, there is no fucking volume and like yesterday, nobody will be selling!

We will take them for EVERYTHING they have and more. Their bunruptcy is cover by insurance firms, who are also covered until infinity. We will get our money one way or the other!

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell  time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to  worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now,  CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking  Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit,  but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The  only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's  getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking  138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're  at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover  yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and  is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while  shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to  cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

58,"I hear a lot of people claiming that what's happening here with GME is some sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.

On Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the ""BUY"" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.

What happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!

Because these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.

They know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.
WE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.

On Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's ""too risky"", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.

They know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.

THAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand. We could see the stock rise to $1,000 a share, only too plummet to $5 in a matter of minutes, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA SELL SHIT!!!

We're living in a timeline where the most retarded community on the entire internet has a chance to be the ones that take down the biggest assholes living on this earth, and literally change the financial world forever. ALL YOU MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SHARES!!!

Fuck the moon, we got the gas the get to Andromeda. Are you willing to come along for the ride and make history? DON'T SELL!"

The squeeze probably will NOT happen today. All we will see is options expiring. This will drive the price up. DON'T BE FOOLED THOUGH. This won't be the real squeeze yet! That will probably happen next week.

On top of this there will be HUGE SHORT LADDER attacks all throughout the day. DONT BE FOOLED, there is no fucking volume and like yesterday, nobody will be selling!

We will take them for EVERYTHING they have and more. Their bunruptcy is cover by insurance firms, who are also covered until infinity. We will get our money one way or the other!

GME SQUEEZE

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî> price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

READ THIS!!!! COPIED IT FROM A WISE REDDITOR!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Look i'm not saying don't buy GME. By all means please do. I'm on your side. Infact, if you get locked out of the US market, i would like to point out that gamestop is traded on the borse frankfurt as well. And according to my trader DeGiro, GME had 1,7 million volume on the US exchange, and <44,000 volume in euros. And yknow, if there's a price difference between the US and EU price, the HFT traders will arbitrade that down to equal price. Do with that info what you will.

But i'm TELLING you! The mining deficit is real! The suppression of the gold and silver price is REAL! There has been delivery wall after delivery wall since April 2020 on the Comex. IT WAS NEVER DESIGNED FOR THAT! We even have signs that the LBMA is running out:

3. When to sell? When you see the price going up very crazy like 5x 10x and you see the insane volume being traded. That's when the shorts are covering. might be tomorrow, might be next week. just buy and hold!

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! üíéüôåüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**üöÄ** **üöÄüöÄüöÄ** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

105,"9 years ago, I had no job and was barely able to make ends meet. I got a scholarship for 2.5k for IT students in impoverished families.

That helped me get set up, upgrade my meals from rice and tomato sauce, move closer to the university to save money on fuel, make new friends, and ultimately set me up for the succesful Cybersecurity career I have today.

The interest in Blackberry made me a significant amount of money, I have been living in my hometown because of the coronavirus preventing me from flying to my new job last year in May.

My local community is rundown, and many places are closing. Young people are struggling without having any local work opportunities.

I spoke to my local council, they haven't had sponsors for a lot of the scholarship awards over the last few years. They got zero sponsors in 2020 as businesses were getting crushed.

So I decided to put up 2.5k for this years IT Scholarship, help host the event, and do media coverage to help youth locally become aware of the opportunities that are available and encourage them to apply.

I hope through continued meme stocks and regular investing to do this every year, as I wouldn't be in this position without that scholarship to begin with."
106,"FR! Like WTF..I‚Äôm just over here having lost LITERALLY hundreds of thousands....I lost $100k when I cashed out all my money to buy in and I lost $200k more because RH tanked the entire thing and left most of us in ruins. So feel free to give back right over here since you‚Äôre holding a bag of cash smh. 

SIDE NOTE: I SURE HOPE EVERY DAMN SOUL ON HERE CLOSES THEIR RH ACCOUNT AND STICK IT TO THE REAL DIRTBAGS; THE SHRIFF OF NOTTINGHAM!! CUZ I CAN PROMISE YOU ANDREW LEFT WHO CAME TO OUR DEFENSE AFTER HE LOST IS NOT THE ENEMY IT‚ÄôS THAT SHIT PILE MFR VLAD AND ROBINHOOD WHO RUINED US. 

FRANKLY IM KINDA SHOCKED THAT WE AREN‚ÄôT RAGING AT THAT ASSHOLE: WE HIT $500!! THEN IT WAS ALL DESTROYED BY THAT SCUMBAG ON OUR WAY TO $1000!

108,"There is a state agency who will go after them with enough complaints.

Report this to your state's Attorney General's office. Very often, if they get enough shady shit like this reported, they'll sue the company to stop it. Sometimes you'll get a refund, sometimes nothing comes of it, but the thing is that you HAVE TO REPORT IT.

Companies like AT&T count on not enough people being engaged enough to file complaints with all of their consumer watchdogs. The FIRST one you should always go to is your state's AG. That person is politically motivated and can build a large following by pursuing shit like this. I've gotten results from complaints against companies as large as AAA, who  fucked me on insurance, and I've gotten nice ""thanks for the report"" letters. No guarantee, but if there's a recourse and enough voters complaining, they'll follow that recourse.

Also, why the fuck are you still dealing with AT&T? This isn't a natural monopoly under a Public Utilities commission. There are alternatives.  That company is the devil, and always has been. They were fucking me over 20 years ago, and they're still evil. When iPhones came out I stuck with my razr specifically because you had to have AT&T to get one, and these days you can get an equivalent quality phone that'll work on just about any carrier.

Vote with your feet. For a cellphone you can always jump to Verizon or T-Mobile, and you can take your phone number with you, so no harm no foul. "
109,"The problem then compounds because the person you're talking to doesn't give a shit, and you have a bunch of newbies constantly answering the phone, who don't know anything. People don't work those jobs because they want to, they work call center to provide for themselves. Usually for shit pay.

Being shitty to someone who didn't make the decision that fucked you is like yelling at a concession stand worker about the price of popcorn. Talk to a manager if you feel the person you're on the phone with can't or isn't helping resolve the issue. 

I cut my IT teeth in a call center/help desk, and I always went the extra mile for people who attempted to treat me like a human being.  The assholes got nothing, or a hard time about getting anything, even if they were entitled to it.

111,Imho AMC has great potential. IT IS NOT GAMESTOP! SQUEEZE IS NOT GAURANTEED. However:  there is a lot less downside. People who say gme won't fall back to 20 after the crash are full of shit. It could potentially grow again but when the floor falls out people will be in freefall. AMC was around 17 bucks prepandemic so I really don't think we'll see it fall below 12 after recent news for any significant amount of time
112,"Hear me out: This goes all the way up to Powell/Federal Reserve and Yellen/US Treasury, not just the hedge funds, CHs, and OCC.

As we saw in 2008, just one financial domino falling can lead to complete collapse. But market collapse is not the ultimate threat. It‚Äôs a US dollar/treasury collapse. Ultimately, if the Fed wants to stop the carnage, they‚Äôd have to take assets onto their balance sheets by printing money. While printing money for stimmies and for bailouts and for welfare and to replace the tax revenue we lost due to COVID and to fight our forever-wars, etc, etc, etc. The DXY USD index has been falling since March and all assets have been increasing. China is now no longer buying US treasuries and is now SELLING them. The social security trust fund is now SELLING its treasuries because payroll tax collections fell so much during COVID, and it now needs to cash out to make SS payments. Russia and China are now doing some trade in euros, ignoring the current USD reserve currency system. China has its digital Yuan ready to roll out immediately to begin international trade without the USD. The USD slide will happen slowly, then all at once ‚Äì when the smart money moves. Even deflationists like Raoul Pal, Jeff Snider, Brett Johnson, etc agree that hyperinflation is the endgame. We‚Äôll have a brief severe flash of deflation during a liquidity crisis, but there‚Äôs immediate hyperinflation after that.

No doubt a firm like Citadel would bail out Melvin if they can negotiate a large ownership position. But why do they demand such a high price? Because IT IS RISKY. If GME continues to rise, the parabolic increase in losses could even bankrupt Citadel. That is the first domino. In the latest Grant Williams podcast, Marc Cohodes posited that maybe Yellen is coordinating everything behind closed doors. She was paid $810k by citadel for speaking fees between her tenures at the Fed and Treasury. She is rich, and has many rich friends in financial institutions. Did she go to RH and Citadel in private? Did she promise Citadel a bailout if the deal doesn‚Äôt work out? Is she terrified of a market/USD collapse? Are Melvin/Citadel still massively short? Maybe. It‚Äôs an interesting thought experiment and certainly possible.

What we are battling for is to have this collapse now. So that we may enjoy the rest of our lives in a sane economy, built on solid fundamentals. Where our hard work results in rewards. The boomers think they can live out the rest of their lives within this bubble, at the expense of their children. Billionaires who exploited our financial system think they can make it to death still believing their riches came from improving resource allocation."
113,EVERYONE MAKE A COPY OF THIS BEFORE IT GETS TAKEN DOWN
114,"# GUYS WE FIGURED IT OUT

# OP IS RIGHT

I keep thinking about how weird exchanges' behavior was on Thurs-Friday. Why would they ban buys but not sales?  Why did RH have 1 share limits on Friday, even after new liquidity was made available to execute trades? Robinhood has even [shut off the ability for people to transfer stocks to other exchanges](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l8xv7p/robinhood_now_blocks_users_from_getting_their/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3). On top of that, hundreds of people were claiming RH closed and sold their call options contracts, without their permission, at the lowest market price, even if they paid with cash. I think we got it. Retail traders own over 100% of the float.

There is one firm who clears 95% of **all** traded stock (DTC). They normally require clearing houses to pay 1-2% of that stock's price as collateral while they carry out the trade. On Thursday, the [CEO of Webull disclosed collateral requirements were suddenly raised to 100%](https://youtu.be/4RS4JIEVyXM?t=160). It sounds like something they'd do if they needed to buy back stock at a 2:1 ratio, right?. There have also been what looks like several ""short ladder attacks"" on these stocks the last few days tanking the price 20-30% before it rockets back up. Could another possibility be that exchanges are scrambling to balance their books and logging 2 sales for every 1 buy? They're shitting bricks and cooking the books, hoping no one catches them before they're done!

That might explain some exchanges 1 share limit too. It artificially boosts buy demand towards new buyers. If I own 7 shares, and someone else owns 5, but half of those shares don't exist, it'd be counterproductive for orders to exchange through us. However, If we both put one up for sale, the exchange could take 1 fake share from me, and one real share from the other, and give the real share to the new buyer.

# Edit:

Elon Musk interviewed Vlad (Robinhood CEO) last night on the [clubhouse tonight podcast.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fkd2sYqvVzY) The exchanges appear to be the scapegoats not the perpetrators. DTC raised RH's daily collateral requirement from about $50-200 million to $3 Billion. Keep in mind, RH has only raised $2 Billion in capital since its inception. This goes all the way up to the covering houses and DTC. Vlad can't directly call them out, because they set his collateral prices every single day, and they control 95% of the trade so there's no competitors to go to. A financial cartel headed by Citadel and DTC have him by the fucking balls. All he has to do is sneeze in the wrong direction and they double the daily collateral requirements forever.."
115,"WHY ARE MODS DELETING EVERYTHING

""IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE'RE IN A COMPLETELY FRAUDULENT SYSTEM."""

119,"Alright retards. We have held the line so far. If our diamond hands hold, the squeeze will be coming. 

When we finally see GME üöÄüöÄüöÄ there will be paper hands who will sell at some price points on the way. Most of them will be unretarded GME holders who are holding most of GME floats right now and don't share our love for the stock. Some of them will be fellow retards who have to give their dog surgery or put their girlfriends boyfriend through college, some of them may be you. Whatever the reason you will put up a sell order there is one thing to remember.

**WHILE IT IS IMPORTANT STOCK GOES UP IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT STOCK DOESNT GO ALL THE WAY DOWN**

This üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ will keep flying as long as it doesn't hit the low price points that let hedges buy out their shorts. This means that even when GME drops at some point, as long as it doesn't drop low enough for hedges to cover, the fuel will keep coming. There is an easy way to keep this up.

**IF AT ANY POINT YOU FUCK UP AND SELL STOCK PUT DOWN A LOWER BUY ORDER AT THE SAME TIME**

As far as we know, hedges need to cover shorts at the < $320 range. If GME rockets to $1000 for example, and you need some cash to not starve to death and sell a share at $1000, immediately put down a buy order above $320. That way even if the stock falls a bit because of your paper hands, it will cushion at the new buy orders and start climbing back up.

**IF EVERYONE WHO SELLS PUTS A BUY ORDER AT A PRICE POINT THE STOCK CANNOT FALL BELOW THAT PRICE POINT**

I have no idea what is coming the next week or maybe even the next month. Maybe you retards crash the world economy. Maybe the stock will shoot high up and fall back down for a bit. I don't think however that the stock will tank all the way down to tens of $. There are too many of you retards who have bought up GME, locked it in a vault of your autism and thrown away the key. In normal stocks when price falls, people panic and sell until there is nothing left. You retards don't know how to sell and there is way too many of you.

Also I don't fucking know what I'm talking about. I bought my first stock yesterday. This is not financial advice. I'm just a retard. If you listen to me, you're an even bigger retard

tl;dr: BUY GME, HOLD GME

if üßªüôåüßªüôåüßª -> BUY GME AGAIN, HOLD GME"
120,"This is what I think:  
They will not shut WSB down but e.g. impose regulations on minimum capital required to trade options after this whole shit goes bust, clearing houses have no money, so brokerages get hurt by margins they offered etc.  
In the end, what WSB was about will be allowed only for folks with idk. $50k.

You don't want to shut down a hedge fund in exchange of some new PDT bullshit.  
In such scenario you literally took a fishing rod, got a fish with it and then throwed fishing rod away to the ocean calling it a victory. That is retarded.  
What IMO should be mentioned here AND I DONT FUCKING SEE IT BEING MENTIONED BY ANYONE ON MAIN WALL is that more valuable is taking down already existing PDT and increase transparency in what hedgefunds are doing (their positions etc.) as they are doing some big ass leverages and stock raids (like overshorted GME).  
Don't get me wrong, I want Melvin capital to go bust for their stupidity leveraged by superior privilege but who cares if you let their friends then regulate your opportunity to repeat that."
121,"I did this before when I was having issues with my Verizon internet. The tech help was no help at all and just kept telling me it must be my computer because there is no problem on their end. They wouldn't even send a serviceman out to check on the lines for us. After trying repeatedly to get someone to help, I was fed up and filed an FCC complaint. A few days later I was called by some executive level IT at Verizon who admitted that they WERE having problems on their end. My internet was fixed in two days."
122,"For years we have suspected that someone has been getting into our storage unit and going through our things. After obvious internal ""shuffling"" around of boxes and then empty boxes and a slowly expanding empty space all without ANY initial signs of forced entry I started exploring an and all ways of possible entry into or out of our units. At each new minor Discovery of possible tampering and some major obvious ones, I would discuss with the owner or manager and even police who I have called out several times to view my ""evidence"", that's what they all refer to it as IF I can get ANYONE to write anything down, ""evidence"", and they make me feel like a TOTAL IDIOT. Everyone who works there and even the non emergency line of the local police....
And yet time goes on and my pile of what's left in my two adjoining 10x30 foot ALMOST 500 PER MONTH WITH REQUIRED WORTHLESS STORAGE COMPANY OWNED INSURANCE PREMIUMS keeps dwindling.....
What was once the spoils of very shrewd but fair dealings in surplus electronics and worth a few 10's of thousands of dollars and a pretty good collection of tools and fixtures that someday would be used to open a service related and electronics repair shop/business has been reduced to empty boxes, packing materials and empty tool kits.
Of course to the casual observer from the front mostly blocked off view the units looked full of stuff that someday would make us financially independent again after many health issues and life getting in the way....

BUT HERE IS THE RUB... 
I get a once in a lifetime awesome opportunity to clear out a bunch of amazing parts, pennies on the dollar, and guilt free because the guy is happy to sell all his stuff to someone who is going to really appreciate it and use it to change his life!
And what do you know, for the first time in many years fate lends a hand and makes available the ONLY OTHER 10 X 30 storage UNIT in the whole damn place right next to ours!
Of course I want it, it's perfect, it's convenient and what do you know.........
THE FUCKING CEILING IS OPEN AND GIVES UNINTERUPTED 24 HOURS A DAY ACCESS INTO BOTH MY OTHER UNITS!!!!!!!!!!
And, the lock on the door has been relocated slightly up and left of its original location so that when locked..... Wait for it......... No really, this is good.........
You can simply lift the door and close it behind you and NO ONE CAN TELL ANYONE IS IN THERE!!!!!!
GET IT?!?!!? BECAUSE IT STILL APPEARS TO BE LOCKED!!!!!
So all the signs I reported, all the little things that I said made me think maybe someone was going over the wall.....
It all adds up.
I think they not only knew I was right, I believe the storage unit people themselves were in on it.
And I think the plan was to make that spot available to me so that I would move a whole bunch of really expensive stuff in that unit which butts right up against their office storage unit, which coincidentally now has a fresh pile of sheetrock dust under what I can only assume it's another hole in the ceiling and which now has had its locked relocated.
I discovered the lock had been relocated on the unit that we just rented two and a half months ago. For all I know it's been that way for years and I just noticed it.
Unit came available the day after I asked them if they had any emergency space I can put some stuff into temporarily.
I set up a whole damn sting operation thinking I was so smart....
I have pictures of the fascia on the front of the building being bent and changed daily almost in the last few weeks. In a weird coincidence because I was taking pictures of the front of the building trying to figure out how they were getting in before, and going back 2 years, I can tell that its changed over time because that's where they crawl across once in the ceiling....
When played in a fast slide show, you can see it moving like somebody crawling through it....
I called the cops to come down and check out the faked lock door, they wouldn't lift the door they said that it looked like it was locked to them, I said okay I'll lift it...told me I'd be arrested, that would be breaking and entering.
I had lifted it before they got there. I'm looking at my own shelves they took, moved through that ceiling piece by piece, not with any of my stuff on them, but other peoples stuff... I don't know who that belonged too.
Storage unit company of course won't tell me who rented that unit.
I think it was one of their own employees.
Someone they assure me still works there but I haven't seen since.
I can't file a police report. No obvious signs of forced entry.
Can't file an insurance claim with no police report.
Now I'm going through the other units and realizing I don't have anything of worth left in there either...
I spent $10,000 storing what I thought was tens of thousands of dollars worth of stuff 4 years and I have nothing to show for it.
And not only is this a rampant problem in this storage location....
But every storage unit. His first online in Oregon at least is having similar if not the very same problems.
Calling around to other storage units and finding previous employees of this storage unit working there is not making me feel any better about the situation....
And the fact that the state of Oregon passed a law that allows these people to force us to pay for their insurance in order to rent space there is not making me feel very good about that either.
So many people are complaining about this online every one of them saying they've been to the cops I cannot believe that the police department's don't know exactly what's going on here.
I would be willing to bet you money if you have a storage unit in Oregon not all of your stuff is in there the way you think you left it...
We have a new manager I take her down to my unit I explained all this, showed her some of my most damning evidence and ask her what she's going to do for me.
Haven't heard from her since....

Now that I got your attention, listen up:

The HFs got some fancy illusions, but thats all they are. Some fancy tricks, mind fuckery and slander.

 Like some high school peer pressure bullying bullshit, only instead of your lunch money they're going after your investments (which for a lot of us isn't a whole lot more proportionally, myself included). 

In my experience, bullys cover their fear with threats. Thats what this all is right now. EMPTY THREATS. They are desperate and scared cause now the whole playground is on to them and they about to get their asses WHOOPED!

They're acting like we never took a hit before, like we're scared of a little scuffle cause they don't live in the streets we grew up on. They're SCARED of being broke and eating ramen daily to make ends meet. MOTHER FUCKERS DONT KNOW WE ALREADY THERE LIVING IT! 

They saw fearlessness last week and are trying to break us of that. What they don't get is that we aren't fearless, WE ARE JUST RETARDED AND STOCKS GO BRRRRR!! 

Its courage they see, my fellow autists, and these scared lil bitches don't get it.

Newbie here. Not an expert, so please don‚Äôt consider this financial advice.

Fine  print in our brokerage contract that‚Äôs never emphasized states that our  brokerages are allowed to LEND out OUR shares without asking for  permission. In other words, while we are holding on to our shares, they  are lending it out on margin calls to the Hedge Funds who are using it  in ladder attacks to drive down the pricing on AMC, GME, NOK etc. People  see the prices dropping and assume the stock is tanking and sell out at  fire sale prices.

AGAIN.

The hedge funds are using OUR own shares to ladder price our shares down and tank the market.

How to avoid this? IT'S EASY !!!

Put  in sell orders on all your stock holdings for AMC, GME, etc. at a  reasonable daily expectation (maybe 3X-4X days opening/closing). This  ties up your stocks for the day and they‚Äôre not allowed to lend out YOUR  stocks.

Less stocks available to the Hedgies to play with, the more the stocks stay strong and rocket.

AGAIN.

HOLD strong and place SELL ORDER LIMITS on your stocks."

Okay, has this place quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall? Let me explain to you what happened, play by play. I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market. Do I have your attention? Here goes:

Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570. Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again? Really? We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock. This creates upwards pressure on the market. We've been seeing these movements all week.

Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off. It didn't work.

Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options. You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so. Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.

Today, the market opened very strong. It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.

At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.

Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.

The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it. What does that mean? It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market. I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user who said a small sell limit order excited at $2600 for him. Do you get the severity of the situation, if true? It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure? A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted. The call writers need shares to hedge. Retail is still buying more. The short sellers need over 100% of the float back. Add these together. There were more shares needed than existed on the open market. That's what a liquidity crisis is.

Listen to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RH4XKP55fM DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello! He's not talking about the market for GME shares. He's talking about the entire market! The New York Stock Exchange. The NASDAQ. All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer? Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets? Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion. They have no bullets. It's the exact same in this market: No capital. No shares. Infinite losses inbound.

TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares. Do you get that? HOLD. Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede. That's how we win.

They needed your shares so badly that they literally risked PRISON TIME to get them. They tried robbing you, and I'm not even exaggerating. They were within 30 seconds of all being wiped out today.

This is across ~3 years.

I'm in IT and these salaries are in Australian dollars.

My first position was a very underpaid job that I took as it was the first thing I could find after getting back from three years overseas (from doing another start up) and fortunately the title was super fancy sounding at an awesome marketing agency (head of a large area of the business) so I used that to spring board to a better position.

Fuck company loyalty - get yours.

I'm on great terms with the boss from the first company and he knows straight up how much im making and regrets letting me go.. But he's still ""only able"" to offer max $85k a year and he works his employees to the bone (mind you he does it in a nice way)...

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

Since it got removed: When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢	‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢	‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

190,"Everyone here is freaking out over something that isn't that material. The minimums for the old account are $300 and the new account are $500. If you exceed those minimums, there are no fees. 

I don't bank with BoA, so can't speak to whether or not their services are worth it, but people here need to realize providing checking / savings accounts isn't done at no cost to the bank. For the most part banks are happy to offer free accounts as a loss leader for additional accounts, services, and business from you. But each account requires a small army of folks, IT systems, a massive security apparatus (both physical and digital), and a regulatory compliance structure behind them to support. Those things cost money, not to mention so does keeping your cash safe from fire/flood/robbers, online banking, a mobile app, and giving you access to your cash instantly anywhere in the country via a debit card, checks, and a massive ATM network. Asking you keep $300-$500 in an account to help partially offset the cost so they can continue to provide depositers these services isn't some grave crime against humanity. 

Now sure there are other entities that still offer those services for free -- that's fair, and I would encourage people to use those services if they think they are worth it. It's a free market out there and entities will compete for your business and as a result some will still waive fees, but this really isn't that big of a deal. If all you have is an amount lower than the $300 minimum, you probably aren't depositing it in a bank anyway. "
191,"Yes.  Do it.  I hate BOA with the passion of a thousand burning suns, but the good thing about them fucking me over is that I realized USAA was also a bank.

I have never loved any bank like I love them.  I didn't even know it was possible to like a bank.  I have done all my financial stuff through them for at least 15 years now, probably 20, since the days of mailing in deposits, before good online banking, and will never switch.

Amazing customer service, good rates, forward thinking IT department always innovating.  It's probably a fearsome place to work but no bank is better than USAA.

If you can bank with them, do it."
192,"Was the coolest part about my dad. I was going through my voicemails a couple days ago and had like 6-7 from my dad over the course of the past few months.

I cannot get to the phone right now, but please leave me a brief message with your name, number, and reason for calling and I will get back to you as soon as possible."" , I could hear my dad talking to someone else for a brief second as he said ""How many 27 year olds do you know that have voicemails like that?"" and then cut out. 

&#x200B;

My dad really didn't know anything about IT or even how to use a computer. Didn't even have an email address. Yet was SO proud of the life I have built from it.

207,"To be honest I've been saying stuff like this for years and it felt like no one listened.

I remember leaving school with no prospects. Picking up work where I could. Being angry at the system because big money got bailed out while I fell in with the 'wrong' crowd (absolute bros who know what a hard life is like tbh but thats another story) got kinda deep into drugs (and shoplifting to pay for it)

At some point I got sick of it and scored myself a job in sales. It sucked the Life out of me but I was pretty good at it. So my shitty sales job got me a slightly better sales job and keeping my head down got me a really good sales job at a really big company. I was there for about 8 months before I realised I couldnt do it anymore.

But through this experience I became a supporter of capitalism. That individual people have the power to put themselves in a better position more than any charity or group or government could so I gave up my nice cosy salary and indebted myself to start a degree (I should graduate in a few months with a degree in compsci) 

I'm still not in a great position financially in fact I'm broke as shit and wish i had some skin in this game. But I've learned and grown and gained some valuable new skills i can hopefully go and make a decent living from with enough to go and make these types of bets and take an ownership stake in the companies that make our economy tick over. 

I'm so proud of you guys cause you're giving me hope that I was right, that we can take things over and start running things ourselves and that maybe... just maybe... with all these tendies you shitheads make you might actually start to stimulate some real sustainable growth both by taking some for yourselves and splashing some cash, by taking improved stakes in other companies and by creating new seed capital for start ups.

I'm 30 and work in the health care admin field. the amount of 50+ year olds are still living in 1960 and oblivious to tech I come across with on a daily basis is staggering. 


I don't do IT but all the old heads in my office come to me with their tech related problems for some reason. "
215,"Dont forget with IT h1-b can come in for half the salary. Look at what disney did with their experienced tech teams a couple years back.

216,"I work in nursing, and I had to do 3/4 of the workload for our one IT guy because he was never around or didn't have the budget or power to really do anything. He's also the third guy in the last 4 years, because the company doesn't exactly make it worth staying.

The CEO refuses to approve raises for any of the employees except annually, and it's 3% basically if you're a 110% perfect employee. (Market inflation is about 8% here.)
It's on average 1.5-2%. Which is pretty low considering we're all cheap labor. And as I quote from a recent meeting ""the few extra dollars an hour won't help you anyways, you're still going to have to work two jobs to afford to live here.""

Meanwhile the facility I work in is completely understaffed and we spend $100k a month on outsourcing to a staffing agency when we could have spent $25k giving people reasons not to leave in the first place. We still use pagers and broken alarm systems that don't even work 8 years later.

We're also one of the ""nicest"" facilities in the area where people end up paying $6k/month just for the room. We charge for the toilet paper."
217,"My friend was the sole IT person for a smaller company. He basically built up their whole system and wrote a bunch of custom code to get everything to work together. The reason so much custom code was needed was the owner refused to purchase new versions of software. My friend goes to work one day and the boss basically informs him he is no longer needed and they give him a small severance package. The owner's plan was to just use a third party service for any IT needs. My friend was escorted immediately out of the building by security after he grabbed his belongings.

Within 48 hours of him being terminated they are having countless computer issues already. The owner didn't know any of the passwords. The owner had no idea the scope of custom software in place. The third party I.T. company sent someone out and quoted the job at over 300,000 to update everything and get all the databases integrated into the new software. That was basically 5 years of pay for my buddy.

My friend said he got countless emails from the owner. He found a better job pretty much instantly and just ignored all the emails. I can't imagine how amazing that must've felt.
"
218,"Thats a really ugly assumption. A lot of jobs plateau. The skills needed to perform the job plateau. The responsibilities plateau. The pay plateaus.

Take my prior career into consideration - it wasnt results oriented. It was a technician job that paid well(but little raises) and in this job there are many ways to skin a cat. My job wasnt to pump out support tickets as fast as I can, it was to provide customer service and resolve the issue. This was an IT field, but the same goes for mechanics, plumbers, contractors, electricians, etc.

At the end of the day, its not about ""using those 15 years particularly well"" these jobs are about ""did you resolve the issue and is the customer happy, yes or no?"" A lot of times, your job CAN be done by someone younger and newer. The difference is, you have been there 15 years and you know your customers and they know you. Youve seen every issue in the book and you know how to fix it. Sure, the young guy will eventually fix it and while you know you fixed it faster, management just sees that it still got resolved. You also know what your bosses expect and how to keep business processes rolling. 

But at the end of the day, a lot of businesses dont give a shit about that. They dont care that youre a great loyal employee who you really should be keeping, they care about saving an extra $10/hr to put into their own pockets.

So again I say, your assumption is really insulting to people who did their job well, excelled at it, poured their heart into it and still got fired for the younger guy all in the name of higher profits for those at the top who are literally riding off of the work that you do.
"
219,In IT schooling and practical application of a subject matter are different. Most new people can't grasp multiple hats of several technologies. The good ones have experience and subject matter training. That's why most IT jobs will pay you next to nothing right out of school. It applies across the board almost all jobs. 
220,">That's why most IT jobs will pay you next to nothing right out of school

Im not sure thats the case for entry level developers.  My first job just started me at 67k then gave a raise once they found out that other entry devs were getting paid more out of school"
221,"While I agree in principle, I think this has much more to do with the person's overall background than it does with their professional experience.

A lot of people go to school for IT because they liked playing computer games, or they think there are good prospects, but they had no real IT experience prior to school.

On the other hand, there are a lot of kids that are interested in IT because they genuinely find it fascinating, and have been learning and playing with things for 5-10 years by the time they graduate.  You can learn a lot without practical experience just by reading stuff."

226,"When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

\- imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days.

\- Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.[https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NYSE/GME/short-interest/) = 6 days

[https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME](https://shortsqueeze.com//shortinterest/stock/term2.php?s=GME) = 6.3 days

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME) = 5.78 days

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

**Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!**

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Mine, for example:

Year 1: 6.8% raise/title promotion. 8% bonus.

Year 2: No raise. 12% bonus (beyond target of 10%) Secondary bonus in options vesting over 2 years (0%-20% salary value, depending on stock price). We'll call this 1x options.

Year 3: 4.2% raise. 10% bonus. 1.5x Options.

Year 4: 14% raise, 10% bonus. 3.5x Options, promotion. (New mgmt team)

Year 5: No raise, 10% bonus, .5x Options. Was a bad year for company as a whole, but tbh I didn't do anything worthy of a raise that year either.

Year 6: Shooting for 6% bonus and 2x options. (Current year - going to see about a promotion for next year).

All in all, almost 30% raise over 5 years, stellar benefits and flexibility, and my starting salary was extremely competitive. Thus far all headhunters struggle to come close to my current salary (and none are willing to ""buy out"" my unvested options)

I think the latest general average unemployment rate of a generic IT worker I heard was less than 2% and this was near the end of the economic meltdown.

"
244,"Just hit one year at my company. I got two pins. One of the company logo and another that has ""1 Year"" on it. No raise this year either because, ""you're already one of the highest paid QA guys and we would like to have a bit more parity on the pay scale for our testers."" Meanwhile IT is building a VR station in the break-room, we've hired about 10 new people including a new company president, new developers, new support personnel, and project management. But supposedly even a cost of living raise for me, ""isn't in the budget."" Yeah, I've already updated my resume and have been sending it out. Screw this."
245,"I've wondered that myself. I live in a city with a big startup & IT market and there are a couple bootcamps to quickly churn out programmers, so I wondered if the music was going to stop as more and more programmers joined up.

I've realized a few things, though. First is that it takes a lot of experience to make a good programmer. Years worth. The people coming out of these camps are the most junior of junior while companies are dying for senior programmers who can be productive with minimal hand-holding; programmers are too expensive for companies to have the capacity to have their seniors training up juniors unless they really have to.

Second is that code knowledge is only part of the game. There's also communication skills, decision making ability, and things that are harder to teach.

And lastly is that there's a really limited people with the true aptitude for coding. Training can only get someone so far. If a person doesn't have a natural aptitude, they're only ever going to be *okay.*"
246,"Yeah, it's possible, though all the economic forecasts I've seen show the IT sector as only growing for as long as I plan to keep my career. 

Entry level jobs are getting definitely more and more competitive, but what a lot of hiring managers say is that the tough part is finding competent engineers. You'll get way more people at the door for an entry level position than you used to, but the amount that can actually problem solve hasn't changed much.

Oh well, I guess just keep calm and try to FIRE as quick as you can in case things go south hah."
247,Seriously every thread that is about careers in some way is just comment after comment from IT people / software engineers / CS students. It's like it the only viable career path.
248,"As well they are trying to weed out/give themselves an easy out for applicants they aren't interested in. 

There is probably also some part of it that is HR asking what someone would need to know to fill a position. The IT manager says 'We need someone really strong on X, that's not something we can budge on' and the HR manager thinks 'Well, I suppose you'd have to be doing something for 5 or more years to be a true expert on it...' not knowing anything about what it really it or how long the tech has been around. 

Similarly, IT manger says they need lots of Windows OS experience. Separately from that, IT manager puts on the applicant info form that the company is currently on Win10. The HR person makes the judgement that you need 5+ years of Win10 exp"
249,"This works well for IT/tech jobs. I average 3-4 years per position, and have been able to stay with one employer. Each time my new 'job' has allowed me to greatly expand my skillset. Not sure how some people can settle down and do the same job for decades at a time."
250,"Every company I've been at, save one, has tried outsourcing of IT, DB management, or coding, and it's always been bad. The Indians the DB was outsourced too had such strong accents we could only communicate through email, and once the company realized how low-skilled they were, it was too late; the Americans had been fired, and the outsourcing company owned the DB. Outsourced coders produced pull requests that were the worst in the system, and communicating with them about needed changes was pure pain (and slow, due to the timezone differences).

2 of the three companies I was at ended up ditching the outsourced employees; the last one I left not long after outsourcing began.

I'm sure there are plenty of executives who think that outsourcing is a great IT solution, but man...it isn't."
251,"Have you ever met an end user before? I'm surprised they even know what Windows is. I think you give too much credit to the process of them making a job posting. They probably have a sheet they just fill the blanks with, or they are just making this listing as quick as possible while not knowing anything about IT, so they don't catch those mistakes.

Just like us, everyone is at their core just trying to make it through the day and finish the task list they have that is most likely longer than they have time to fulfill."
252,"Re: Gamestop

Fellow humans: This is more than a meme. This is more than a way to earn a quick dollar. This is more than a way to fuck over rich people. This is a social movement. This is a grassroots push for a more equitable system. This is a way to expose corruption and greed. This is a way to force the system to change.

What happened: A number of wealthy people attempted to make themselves richer by manipulating loopholes in the market. They borrowed shares of Gamestop, sold them, and trashed the company publicly in an attempt to force Gamestop out of business. Aside from being wildly unethical, these wealthy people leveraged financial tools (short selling on margin/naked short selling) that only exist to make rich people richer. These tools exist for no other purpose. They do not add any value to our society. What they did is analogous to betting that your grandma will die, and then killing her yourself.

What does this mean: This means that the rich people who were engaged in unethical practices (see above) were caught with their pants down. It means that they stand to lose billions of dollars. It means that many of us ‚Äúamateur‚Äù traders stand to permanently change our circumstances. It means we can afford rent and food without going into debt, buy our first house, pay off our student loans, pay for our kids‚Äô schools, invest in our retirements, start small businesses, pursue a passion, PROGRESS in life. Perhaps most importantly, it provides us with a VOICE. 

What can you do: Identify and contact your local, state and federal representatives. Tell them that if anything fishy happens with the Gamestop situation, you will never ever vote for them again. Make your voice heard on social media. Talk to your friends and family about it. Don‚Äôt listen to anyone who tells you that ‚Äúthese reddit people are crazy, this stock is worthless, innocent people are going to get hurt, this undermines the mechanics of the free market, etc.‚Äù That is all bullshit. The fact of the matter is, the wealthy people mentioned above are panicking, and are willing to say anything to undermine the cause and hold onto their ill-begotten wealth. 

If you like the $GME stock as much as I do, BUY IT AND HOLD IT. I am not a financial advisor, I am not ‚Äúsmart‚Äù enough. I am just a concerned individual who likes the stock.

You can withdraw it to your checking account, you can reinvest it, you can cash it and burn it, it doesn‚Äôt matter you have made 12k. If you reinvest it and make 3k more you‚Äôve made 15k for the year. If you reinvest it and lose it all, you still have made 12k for the year, and it still gets taxed, EVEN IF YOU LOSE IT.

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 5 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Weds or Thurs next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 138-140% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

Please read!!! This text will be the most important piece that you‚Äôll see today!!!

They didn‚Äôt exit any of their short positions! You can look it up!!! The fund sold their shares to other funds, which made the stock algorithm think the stock is being sold ‚Äî> price goes down ‚Äî> the found that bought sells those shares again to the fund that sold them in the first place ‚Äî> price drops even more ‚Äî> they keep doing that ‚Äî> price drops lower every time ‚Äî> but as long as we hold they weren‚Äôt able to exit any positions!!! Shorts are still up 120% percent. As long as we hold the squeeze is inevitable!! And if you don‚Äôt believe me, look at the GME after hour stock price!

Furthermore don‚Äôt sell at 1000$ tomorrow or next week!!! It can be way fucking higher! I‚Äòm talking about numbers around 10/20k per share! Compared to the VW squeeze in 2008 GME would need to be valued at 34000$ per share!!!

EVERYBODY READ THIS! Important!

When do we sell? A quick guide for GME Army. (SECRET TO DIAMOND HAND üíéüôå )

Too much disinformation about when to sell. I'm tired of seeing people paper handing GME when it drops by 20%, or saying to sell Friday (BTW DO NOT FUCKING SELL FRIDAY OR I WILL COME OVER THERE AND DO STUFF TO YOU!) so here is the DEFINITIVE guide on how to play the ending.

First, we need to understand what is ""Days to Cover"" or ""Short Ratio"" .

Official definition:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover, also called short ratio, measures the expected number of days to close out a company's issued shares that have been shorted. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Days to cover is calculated by taking the number of currently shorted shares and dividing that amount by the average daily trading volume for the company in question. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†A high 'days to cover' ratio can often signal a potential short squeeze.

Dumbed down version:

‚Ä¢ ‚Å†imagine you're Melvin Capital and you have 1 million dildos up your ass. How long will it take to get all those dildos out of your ass? If the volume of dildo removing is 1 per day, then it'll take 1 million days to remove 1 million dildos up your ass. If it's 50,000 dildos a day, then it's 20 days. ‚Ä¢ ‚Å†Same thing with covering short positions. How long will it take Melvin Capital and other shorters to cover their short positions? You take alllll the shorted shares, divided by the average volume of share movement per day, and you get something called ""Days to Cover""

Now you know what day's to cover means, you can check many websites to see what is the days to cover for GME.

So you can see, even if Melvin Capital wants to cover their shorts, it's gonna take them DAYS, and right now it's gonna take them an entire trading week to cover their position.

So what does that mean for us?

Well, we're just waiting for the day when Melvin Capital starts covering their position. When is that day? VERY FUCKING SOON. They're are bleeding out of their ass with the insane interest rate they're paying for their position, and a lot of puts are expiring on Friday, plus a lot of ITM (in the money) calls expire Friday and can be exercised to get shares.

Friday might be the day where Melvin Capital have no choice BUT to start covering.

Now, IF this happens, then it's not gonna take Melvin Capital 1 hour to cover all their shorts, but DAYS. Meaning if Melvin capital starts covering FRIDAY, it will take them at LEAST 3 DAYS to fully cover, which means ALL of next week, the price will keep increasing and increasing! So realistically I'd say Tues or Wed next week might be peak sell time, IF the covering starts Friday. No need to panic sell. No need to worry about a top that lasts for minutes. It will LAST FOR DAYS!!!!!

Now, CNBC and all of the MM's and corrupt media will fool you into thinking Melvin Capital has already covered their shorts or some other bullshit, but don't believe it. It takes DAYS to do so!

The only numbers you should be looking at is the short ratio. If it's getting smaller, then the squeeze has begun. If it's still at fucking 120% like it is now, NOTHING EVEN HAPPENED YET.

We're at fucking $250 after hours and the shorts still haven't begun to cover yet! Imagine when they do? $1000 is actually a very low estimate, and is no longer a meme number. If we all play it right and hold while shorts cover, we can literally squeeze this to infinity as they try to cover.

TL:DR = ACTUALLY FUCKING READ IT AND HOLD MOTHER FUCKERS HOOOOLLLDDDD. WE'RE ROBBING WALLSTREET TOGETHER!!!!!

(just putting this out there for everyone as a reminder and as a quick crash course for any new prospective GMEers)

THINGS WE KNOW ABOUT GME FOR THIS WEEK (first week in March):


1. DFV is a beast and we honestly owe a lot to him.
2. We crushed the $100 resistance level out of the park and very well may have established a NEW FLOOR at $117. Finishing above $120 in regular market hours yesterday was HUUUUUGE as it shows a commitment to the witching hour from the masses.
4. According to people who actually commit their lives to understanding trends in the stock market, our NEXT RESISTANCE LEVEL will be at $126. This may be our next potential fight, and as such we need to be prepared to send it into the stratosphere as soon as we see it start to dip at that level.
5. BUY THE MINI DIPS! Waiting for the ‚Äòright‚Äô moment isn‚Äôt going to happen on a stock like this. Any dip is going to be quickly corrected and if you wana make the most out of things it‚Äôs in your best interest to pump it up as soon as you see negative movement - whether you have stock in GME already or not.
6. The more people that buy more and hold, the better chance we have of getting ourself triple digit+ gains. This means that NO ONE SHOULD SELL TODAY. This is not your typical stock. There is a mission behind this onslaught, and you better understand it. This only works if everyone gets on board and stays on board. 
7. There are PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACTS on the masses whenever we fuel the jet. Whenever a true stock rocket is taking off, everyone and their mother hops on. That‚Äôs how this works. When someone sees a sure way to make money for free, they do it. It‚Äôs that simple. And it makes sense. Thus, whenever we see a rocket, the more and more we pump it up ‚Äî> the more people jump on ‚Äî> the higher the resistance level we create. Pretty numbers like 150 and 200 are both extremely exciting and terrifying to people. People will doubt those numbers are reachable, but once those barriers are hit there is some involuntary reflex that says ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù and more people hop on and FOMO their tits to Valhalla. While this may typically be a less than stellar idea in normal circumstances, it is the best thing that could happen right now. And make no mistake, IT WILL HAPPEN in the curious case of GME.
8. The amount of options in place at 150, 200, and 800 is truly RIDICULOUS. The likelihood of this thing rocketing to a realm where the gains legitimately changes peoples‚Äô lives, their children‚Äôs lives, and their grandchildren‚Äôs lives for the better is not just a pipe dream.
9. This is not going to come without it‚Äôs trials and tribulations. The stock market has ebbs and flows, even with an atypical situation like this. PAPER HANDS ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY. Don‚Äôt get fooled by market manipulation or a slight dip. This thing is going up whether you think it is or not. You can either be a part of history and change your economic sustainability or watch from the sidelines as others have the courage to change their lives forever. DIAMOND HANDS WILL SET YOU FREE.

320,So true story. I direct an IT department and we have tools that monitor the network and such that displays on 52 inch screens in their office and mine. I go out and one of my guys has the stocks up on the display. What did I do? Not a DAMN thing!!!
321,"# In case you're not understanding yet what is going on and how they drop the price

1. There are two markets. The actual market and the shadow market (called Over The Counter OTC which is a market between marketmakers and hedgefunds)
2. Shitadel (allegedly) is dumping shares on the real market for a price lower than current.
3. One of their crony hedgefund friends is buying them at that lower price
4. This makes the price go down, especially since we are all holding and almost NOONE is trading, the effect of this is pretty massive.
5. Ok so they traded and made the price go down. Now they're out of shares right?NO. They're using the OTC market to give back the shares, and then repeat the same process continously to drop the price without end.

# Why are they doing this

To make you scared, and to try and get you to sell. There are no other explanations. Well maybe to prevent being margin called. However, they're borrowing more and more shares to do this, so if you DONT SELL OR EVEN BETTER BUY MORE they're doing all this for nothing and they will be worse off than they started.

# Can I see proof of this?

Proof that there is major traffic in the OTC market for GME. 500 million plus shares in january!Thats 10x float. (No this does not mean short interest is 10x float)

If you want proof of the down trading then search for ""GME level 2 live"" on Youtube during trading hours. You will see in the bid AND ask column a suspicious number of listings for a weird number of shares. ""19"", ""26"" ""37"" ""51"". All weird numbers that they use to identify eachother. These get traded hundreds of times back and forth per hour by algorithms.

# THEY CAN CRASH IT TO $20 IF THEY WANT TO
And all you have to do to win is BUY but at minimum HOLD.

Everytime you sell (including daytrading, paperhanding or selling and buying back later on the dip for more shares) it RESETS the time to deliver and delays the squeeze.

324,"> This would make sense if TransUnion was a startup, with limited money for IT infrastructure. But they're not. They have plenty of money to keep their website up.

Even major websites from professional companies are usually limited to about 5000-10000 connections at any given time.  Most will start experiencing noticeably poor performance at about 5000 hits, and just keel over and lock up at 10K plus.

Google gets away with it because there is no one Google website; there are thousands of Google websites that are connected in the back end and resync during off load cycles, and the results each one gives is going to be slightly different depending on which one you're hooked into because of that.  

Really really big websites will have load balancing to distribute the hits to different areas of the country, but even those are going to be hammered during a major event like this.  Web servers aren't Cray super computers, even if the actual transaction computers behind them are mainframes. "
325,"Correct, but then the dark web people are going to start slowly using the account information, and the first time they get a rejection because an account is frozen, they'll toss it and go on to the next one.

They are well aware that for every 100 CC accounts or SSNs or even bundles of info they buy on the dark web, a good 60-90% of it is going to be unusable.  Why bother chasing after the bad stuff when you already hit jackpot with the other dozen?

They also tend to move fast once a big breech makes public news.  Last year, when I had my identity stolen, it was because a third party stole billing information from a medical office I went to (very ironically via a worker's comp issue, as I used to do IT for them!  Was one of their other vendors that got hacked though, not my old office.  /shudder)    The hack was announced in August of last year; some people had accounts opened in their name and that's how the hack was found out. The rest of us went into the ""credit watch"" for free for 90 days.  Almost 100 days after the breech was announced, when most folk's freebie credit watch expired, is when I had 4-5 accounts opened in my name in the span of 24 hours.  (Took a month to get everything cleaned up.....)

They are taking advantage of the ""open an account today, get approved immediately, charge $500 today"" and buying goods with high resale values - video game consoles, jewelry, watches.  They take home the goods and promptly flip them for cash on Craigslist or at a flea market. The consumer whose info was stolen is stuck with a credit mess, and the retailer is ultimately left holding the bag.

They need the stop the ""open the line of credit, get approved today, and charge the stuff immediately"" offers, since those are the easiest to abuse.  "
326,">It's really easy to look at actively managed funds in 2008, and see how bad of a wash they took.


Worked for a mutual fund manager in 2008, can confirm that we absolutely lost our shirts. 

There was one particularly bad day where the day's price drop on multiple funds was SO big that the system refused to accept the price as ""correct"". The system was programmed to reject anything greater than a 10% change because ""it'll never drop by that much in ONE day!"". Well, it did. And we had to call the IT guy back to the office (we were pricing after hours) to remove the 10% restriction so we could actually price the funds.

Not gonna lie, those were pretty scary times. 

"
327,"Yup. Someone stopped me from falling for this scam once. It seemed beyond fishy, but I was hurting for money, so a way to make some seemed like it was at least worth a shot. Someone told me it was money laundering. Perhaps they were wrong, but it dissuaded me from doing it either way.

I was told to cash the check, buy an specific iPod, mail it to a location and keep the leftover cash as ""payment.""  

After a few days, the ""company"" emailed me back in a much less professional tone and basically said unless I mailed the iPod soon, they'd press charges against me for ""stealing"" their money.  I NEVER DEPOSITED IT so I wasn't even slightly worried. I told them I knew it was a scam and that I had turned the check over the the LAPD, which I also didn't do."
328,"I don't know why all these people go down that line of thinking. Is it just the greed that turns their brain off? I've had so many people come into my office with checks and say ""so I just received this fraudulent/scam  check but I want to DEPOSIT IT ANYWAY, just in case"", wait for it..... ""it's really legit""

Why the actual fuck would you DO that????

Not edited to sound nicer. No offense but why would you do that??"
329,"It depends. Currently, in America they guarantee [12 weeks of FMLA unpaid sick leave](https://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/). This covers serious physical/mental health issues, care taking of family members and dependents, as well as births/adoptions. As you can tell, the combination of expensive healthcare and no guranteed paid sick leave is a huge problem in the US.

I'm very lucky, though. My company has unlimited PTO, so sick days are covered as part of that. Unlike many companies, this isn't a scam, and it's sincere. Maybe it's because we're remote first and don't have managers, so there's no one to tell us we can't take PTO, and we're not required to notify anyone in particular. I wish more of the world was like this. 

For instance, I routinely take a couple half-days every week because I am chronically ill. No one at work even realizes I am chronically ill because I get all my work done, and recently people have been setting up meetings to ask me for advice because they think I'm super productive (who knew?). If I was required to be in the office 5 days a week for 8 hours a day or if my company had a normal sick-leave policy, I wouldn't be able to physically pull it off, and I'd end up on permanent disability, instead.

Back to the original topic of extended leave, our handbook states that we have 12-weeks FMLA leave and that approvals for paid FMLA leave will be decided on a case-by-case basis. Short-term illnesses, minor surgeries, and situations like mine where I need frequent days off are just considered regular PTO. That means HR doesn't care, doesn't want to know, and the number of sick days is not counted or accrued throughout the year.

In practice, I can't imagine extended leave being unpaid if all the paperwork was filled out. For instance, our head of IT hired 2 people and then immediately went on paternal leave for a month and told us to fuck off and solve our own damn problems üòÖ. I doubt he'd take a full month off if he wasn't getting paid.He has been sneaking into Slack and responding to messages, so we all tell him to shut up and eventually he unsubscribed from the important channels. If anyone notices he's been tagged in a public channel, we politely tell them to stop and reach out to the minions he abandoned. "

--its a short ride, it only takes 5 minutes to get to their destination.   

lyft pays the absolute minimum for this ride (in los angeles) its $2.36

**you just spent** 20+15+5+5 = **45 minutes and got paid $2.36**   

this is before expenses like gas, upkeep, or income tax as an ""independent contractor""   
you have no employee benefits like healthcare or 401k etc.    
no job security.  
no possibility of a raise.  
no possibility of advancement.  
no training for advancement.  

in addition to this, any time lyft claims there is ""surge pricing"" as a multiplier for how much you get paid.  
THEY JUST DONT PAY IT.  

when you look at the ride breakdown of how much you get paid versus how much lyft stole from you, you notice **LYFT TAKES UP TO 70% of the money**  
and they're not doing anything.  
you are the driver, you do 100% of the work.   

lyft takes its ""ride set up fee"" from every single ride, they got their cut, but NO, thats not enough.  
they take 30 to 70% of your ""PER MINUTE"" and ""PER MILE"" ON TOP of the ""ride set up fee""

its a scam. dont do it."
348,"My husband is in IT, he tells me this and other scams are costing billions. This is ripe for a class action suit. "
349,"Yeah, you really shouldn't be allowed to scare people about a 'scam' when the real issue is that u/underwater_grilling didn't actually **read what he was agreeing to** when signing up for a credit card.

It's equivalent to

>WARNING! YOUR CREDIT CARD IS SCAMMING YOU! IF YOU DON'T PAY IT OFF IN FULL THEY CHARGE SOMETHING CALLED ""INTEREST"". I DID NOT AGREE TO INTEREST."
350,"Don't undersell yourself - especially if you're not desperate.  
One place I worked at ... was laid off - got a really nice ""package"" too.  
Anyway, fast forward about a year - I was working, but doing a ""temporary"" (but no end in sight ... yet) contract gig - with good compensation, company that had laid me off was ""flirting"" with me - talking about possibly offering me a job, ... meantime, I got a nice full time employment offer with good benefits, etc., elsewhere ... so, I told company (former employer) that had been flirting with me, if they were going to make me an offer, this was the time to do it - as I had a good offer on the table, so ... the made me an offer - not all that bad, but I said thanks but no thanks - as I had quite a bit better offer on the table ... then they made me *another* offer, ... big jump ... oooh, ... nice, ... and better (overall, including other factors too) than the offer I had on the table, ... it was also a substantial jump above what they'd been paying me before ... heck, it was a larger jump than the largest they were allowed to give me if they'd never laid me off ... let alone having given me a very nice severance package in the meantime (which of course I also got to keep).  So, ... it worked out well.  So, ... yeah, ... don't sell yourself short.  And if they don't come up with the ""right"" offer, there's generally as good or better out there somewhere else to be found.

Random: many companies also don't have any decent effective way to *reduce* employee wages when conditions warrant (e.g. economy tanks and prevailing wages are down) ... so instead they layoff, and rehire (typically rehiring others - but in any case for less).  Highly inefficient.  I once saw a company instead hadnle that quite well ... there was a spike/bubble in prevailing wages ... did they raise everyone's wages to keep up and hold down attrition rates?  No, ... but they instead did something smart and competitive ... they started paying quite non-trivial ""hot job skills bonus"" payments to their employees ... quarterly.  That kept them quite competitive with prevailing compensation, and *without* adjusting base salaries.  And ... it was IT/tech in the San Francisco Bay Area.  And ... when the dot com bubble burst? ... lots and lots of companies laid people off (many to only rehire a bit later) ... but this company ... they fairly quickly just stopped paying those ""hot job skills"" quarterly bonus amounts ... putting them right back on track with paying the now lower but still competitive prevailing compensation at the time - very smart move on the part of that company.  Basically they well realized it was a ""bubble"", and took appropriate steps to both reasonably deal with that - and be well positioned to deal with that when that bubble burst."
351,IT does sound like he is in the 1.2x range not 1.5x (half time but at 60% of FT salary).  That is however low for consulting... heck he is probably just looking at what he effectively had to pay after taxes/bonuses and then divided that by 2.  
352,"I'm a consultant at a consulting firm, and we write up an SOW (Statement of Work) and have it signed by the client and ourselves as a sort of contract of expectations. Within, there's the explanation of the project and why it's necessary, a general timeline and key deliverable deadlines, and - very importantly - a list of expectations that are necessary for on-time delivery of the project.

This section is really important, it's typically a bullet-point list of the requirements to finish the project on time. Stuff like ""Client SMEs (Subject Matter Experts) will be available to answer questions and test the application throughout development"", ""A Development environment will be made available throughout the course of the project and team members will be given appropriate permissions to access and update the environment as-needed"". Etc.

This way, if you get 15 days into the project and realize that Bob had planned vacation during the last 5 days of the project, and that this will affect the timeline, you can point to the SOW and explain that this interference was why there was a delay. Or maybe the client had problems with the IT infrastructure and it corrupted the work already done, which extends the timeline of the project.

But, to your point, there's only so much this can cover. Part of being a consultant - particularly an independent consultant in charge of writing up these contracts and getting project approval - is appropriately estimating work and giving yourself enough time in the contract to get the work done on time. There are all sorts of tricks that consulting companies use (And that I, personally, hate) to underbid on projects but sign contracts with adequate budgets/timelines. 

Yes, absolutely reasonable to question your consultants if they go over the allotted budget or timeline. But as a consultant, there are some protections you can put in place to make sure 5 hours over doesn't become a lawsuit."
353,"As a contractor you set your terms and rates. FLSA requires no overtime, but you're free to negotiate triple pay for when some overtime requirements are met. It's pretty common to do stuff like ""I charge 4x for Sunday work"" when it's an IT person and they need to specify off hours but they will do emergency work."
354,"I'm the same way (not being able to sell myself). I've done consulting a few times during my career - most recently from 2012 - 2015. I don't sell anything, terrible at it.

Currently, I'm an IT Director. I've been that before, as well as other technical jobs, but mostly management. My technical skills are rusty, but I can generally figure anything out. My consulting is mostly oriented around SMB IT needs. 

Most of the time, I buy coffee and show up to ask for the head of IT. If he's not available, I leave the coffee for him along with a small fact sheet of what I do. Next week, I show up again. This repeats until someone sits down with me for 10 minutes. I ask questions, they talk about their needs or lack of them, and I try to see if there's a fit. If there is, I explain ideas on how to help them. Sometimes I get work, mostly I don't. I do this 1-2 days a week. When I run out of the SMB's in my area, I start over again.

After a couple of months, I usually have more work than I can handle. Note that I'm not selling myself or anything, really. We're just talking shop, and sometimes I can help. If I can't, I might know someone who can. If I don't know anyone, well, I'll see them again in a few months anyway, and things might have changed... for one thing, I'll generally note down what I couldn't help with, and then study up on it. Who knows, I might find an answer."
355,"A lot of careers are like that. I am currently an IT Sys Admin and spent $65k getting a bachelor's degree in IT Info Systems. Great on paper and has helped me get in the door of the last 2 jobs I've had since college, but the experience and projects you gain over time mean *way* more on a resume than some piece of paper a school gave you. In fact I bet I could have the same position without that degree and instead more internships and certifications. Makes me wish I'd have realized this before going off to college; Would have saved a lot of money and been in this career at a much earlier age and likely in a better overall financial position. Unfortunately society and high schools drill it into our children's minds that College is the *only* path to success. Reality is, it's not. "

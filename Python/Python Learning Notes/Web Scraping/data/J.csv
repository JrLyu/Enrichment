1,J is back? What a fucking moron
2,"J.Cramer flat-out admits in his now-famous Dec2006 clip with TheStreet that they use media outlets like CNBC to dump their lies onto, which is a vital skill among HF players."
3,"Don't know who Patrick J Toomey is but he bought GME right at the top üòÜü¶ç

Edit: he sold a day later at a loss ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
4,"J-pow ""Guys we were counting on you all to not fuck this up! You have all completely screwed over our entire nation with your reckless behavior!""

CEO's hang heads in shame

J-pow ""Which is why now we are forced to give you trillions of dollars and buy up your mistakes and eat them!""

CEO's all nut in unison."
5,"Yeah because of the last jump in price they actually paid off most of their outstanding debt so I don‚Äôt see them going bankrupt anytime soon. Also there are talks of various big players trying to acquire amc in the near future, they have a meeting coming up at May 4th which might force ALL the shorts to cover as well. 

Any way, I‚Äôm just reading what gets posted here and other subs and try to make my own choices. I got burned by SDNL ( of well I could‚Äôve gotten out at 200+ but left with 80 something) and J learned my lesson not to FOMO."
6,J'aime cette action.
7,"Lies told by liars

J.k. mod me beautiful. I'll kiss you where it counts."
8,"Serious question; is 4 weeks vacation considered good in the States?

Edit: Thanks for all the replies. The reason I'm shocked is the legal minimum here in the UK is 5.6 paid weeks and we're not great by European standards... The French barely ever work... J/K Frenchies :)"
9,"Fellow retards, after reading J U S T I N  S U N ‚Äò s tweet that he will be putting in 10 million more dollars tonight, it‚Äôs clear our battle is just beginning. This steady 300-350 price range is the most stable the price we‚Äôve seen in this stonk in a long time.  We are engaged in a staring contest with a blind person (HF‚Äôs). They need us to blink. 

What will likely cause the first blink is the exercising of call options later today.  This will inevitably trigger profit taking by paper handed fucks, lurkers, haters, and those who don‚Äôt understand what they‚Äôre a part of in the context of history and social impact. 

Hold. Hold. Hold. Set limits that allow you the financial freedom that these champagne sipping, concrete jungle apes want to take from you. 

I am a retarded ape. I don‚Äôt know how to count money, nor give financial advice. I eat the lice out of my wife‚Äôs boyfriends hair in exchange for chicken McNuggets.

Edit: üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ"
10,"Quick somebody call J Pow 

We‚Äôll have national cross-out day where everybody stacks their benjies and sharpies out the two zeros 

Ta-da, inflation has transitted away"
11,Your J.P. Prewitt.....
12,"I found this buried in the 10k filing:

>This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the ‚Äú2021 Annual Meeting‚Äù), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aim√©, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.**

So originally 4 members of the board were leaving at the June board meeting, but now they are listing 8?"
13,"I hope some people see this. I have shit for karma and couldn‚Äôt make a post of my own. All praise be to u/johnnydaggers for inspiring me to do some digging. For disclosure purposes, I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, just an ü¶ç like everyone else on here. 

I Researched back to February 2018

Current filed SC-13Gs and 13Ds account for 56.649M shares of the claimed 70M shares outstanding reported in the quarterly earnings from 10/31/20. 

Less than 14M shares outstanding to the public. 

Claimed 300M authorized shares with 65M issued and 70M outstanding. 165M shares unaccounted for. That‚Äôs 122% more shares than GME has claimed on their earnings reports. This seems to be the same as the short number I‚Äôve seen reported by everyone on here and their respective DDs. 

If we assume 10 shares for every reasonable autist, my measly accounts included and 1M true autists, with 5M bandwagon autists that only got their hands on 1 share a piece...we‚Äôre looking at 15M shares accounted for. These are fairly conservative estimates based on the huge numbers of stocks I‚Äôve seen that some of you possess. 

I think u/johnnydaggers might be on to something. 

300M authorized

14,"Melvin's prime brokers are Goldman, Morgan Stanley, J.P. Morgan, and National Financial according to a 3/18/20 SEC filing. [https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf](https://reports.adviserinfo.sec.gov/reports/ADV/173228/PDF/173228.pdf)

Not sure where you got Deutsche as one of the PB's, I guess Melvin could have changed since the filing but a source would be nice. Good post"

16,"I have a family of 5 and spend $866.67. We live in rural Massachusetts, so food is typically priced. A gallon of Milk is $2.89 for reference. 

* Breakfasts: We have chickens and eat a lot of eggs. Oatmeal is a staple. 

* Lunch: The kids get free lunch at school, but when they are home, they eat leftovers or a sandwich (meat and cheese or PB&J). They love ramen, but I try to limit it for health reasons. Same for mac&cheese&hotdogs (though I did just purchase a bulk bag of natural cheese powder on amazon, so this will happen a lot in summer)

* Dinners: We eat a lot of rice and beans. We eat a lot of vegetables (I try to grow them, but savings are negligible). We have a vegetarian dinner 1-2 times a week. Meat is usually whatever is on sale. I pay for one of those shopping list/weekly menus where they match the sales to recipes (bonus, it gets my husband to share the burden of cooking). 

As for where people find the time, teach your kids basic cooking skills. Mine (11,8,and5) can do breakfast and lunch foods. Working on knife skills for dinners. I bet if I prepped everything for them, they could make dinner too. "
17,"Tell me about it. I dreamt a few nights ago that I was walking a PB&J on a lease.

EDIT: ""Leash"" obviously lol"
18,"I need to sign up for your class. One of *the most attractive* qualities a man can have (according to my girlfriend) is knowing how to cook.

I can make cereal and PB&J. I'm 24. Yes, it's embarrassing."

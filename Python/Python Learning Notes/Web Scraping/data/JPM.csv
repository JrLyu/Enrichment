0,"JPM is amazing, especially if you normally bank with Chase"
1,I love JPM because my transfers from my Chase bank account are instant. It's nice to have the ability to put money in as I go.
2,"Nah. JPM has been doing this with (guess what?) Silver for years - and gotten slaps on the wrist. 

Despite it being known, now we just assume that the price of silver is heavily manipulated. Tells you why they manufactured this fake narrative of silver - because they own it, and can control it"
3,"Squeezing silver is not like squeezing GME where the target is Melvin.

Squeezing silver is a boss fight - you're going up against JPM, Citi, BAC, MS. Completely different ball game.

Also already lost $7k trying to play SLV in August."
4,"This dude is a fucking moron - someone ban him.

&#x200B;

The ONLY way to squeeze silver is via physical or $PSLV - SLV ain't gonna do shit. 

&#x200B;

Buy $PSLV - starve the beast.  Max Keiser ran a ""Crash JPM buy  Silver"" campaign in 2011 and ran silver to $50.   This is the ONLY way to cuk the banks"
5,"A presious metal going up in price does not equal squeeze. For every 100 short squeezes people scream about maybe, MAYBE one of them actually happens. Plus JPM won't let a real squeeze on SLV happen. They have been manipulating that market for years and other than relatively small fines nobody gives a fuck. If you want to invest for long term wait for it to drop back down and then invest. But don't hold to long because space is closer than ever and precious metal aren't exactly rare out there."
6,"There is also a simple fact that silver is a highly used industrial metal of which more and more is and will be needed by Tesla and others to power the EV revolution among other sectors. There is a massive physical supply problem going on that is putting the screws to the paper trade that JPM fucks with daily.

They don't build cars out of GME, folks."
7,"Its just a supply shortage. However if there are massive calls for physical delivery from futures markets that could actually initiate a short squeeze when they can't deliver and banks like JPM are instantly underwater on their positions, since they're at 500-1 bullshit to real metal."
8,"Silver is going through a supply shortage which has other consequences for shorters like JPM that are losing their ability to steer the ship. It really depends if futures markets get pinched on real delivery, if that happens then there well could be an actual short squeeze, but that is nothing the likes of WSB can initiate by itself like GME was, the market is just too damned big and global.

That said, I still think the DD on silver is pretty good on a longer time frame. Industrial production *needs it*, and its in short supply."
9,"A YouTuber I follow likened it to a game of musical chairs, where there’s only one seat left and if the shorts don’t get it, the upside is theoretically infinite. Doesn’t matter how much money these institutions and clearinghouses have; ultimately big banks like GS and JPM would be the ultimate bag-holders. The Scary (Hilarious) part of this whole thing is that, with theoretical unlimited upside - It could potentially wreck either or both of those institutions.

Another thing that bothers me is that if things started pushing price levels so ludicrous that they issue a prolonged halt pending an investigation - would our shares be worth be worth anything seeing as some may be “counterfeit”"
10,"No one will man, look at 2008. It's bullshit. Hell, they'll probably try and throw DFV in jail for market manipulation or some bullshit like that before anyone on Wall Street goes to jail.


I mean, JPM had an almost billion dollar fine for their silver market manipulation. They broke the law, massively in way that fucked the commodities market. Did anyone go to jail? Nope. They just get slapped with a fine and are left to carry on doing the same crooked shit they always do. It's how the system works, that's why it's a broken system."
11,JPM too

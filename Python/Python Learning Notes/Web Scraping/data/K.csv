Their excuse is that basically it’s their intermediaries who are calling the shots - WELL THEY SHOULD STAND BY THEIR CUSTOMERS FFS!!!"
1,"U.K. here. Been wishing I could put money in but don’t really have the funds available to lose. Reading your post reminded me of how terrible it was back then and how sick it makes me feel to think those responsible went unpunished, or worse, were rewarded. It’s not much but I can and can’t afford to lose £1500 so I’ll be dumping that on GME this morning. Not looking to make money more than I am hoping I can buy extreme satisfaction leveraging my small savings against those who deserve to be punished."

5,"Seriously glad I found this sub, not just for the monies but for the autism, this is right up there with bestgunnit and the like. Also I got into my liquor cabinet tonight while trying to dodge responsibilities. 

But really though I want to thank you all, here's why: At 17 I joined the Army and did that thing you do where you get fucked by the big green weenie, then I went off to college, lived like a poor, then got a decent job and made decent money, dabbled a bit with positioning my 401k and IRA myself and shit. Then COVID came and I lost my job and didn't see a penny from the gubment, while I lost pretty much everything but my truck and my investments, which I was getting close to having to pull. I always did everything right, and when I needed help, the one time I asked the world to help, I got fuck all. Meanwhile a bunch of dipshits got rich off our despair, fuggum'.

This right here is God's work. We are bringing power to the people, showing the elite to get R E K T, and making money doing it. I love you mongoloids, all of you. 💎✊💎✊💎✊💎✊💎✊"

I do realize that three hundred and seventeen words would be impossible to summarise this very special topic that concerns our country as a whole, from under the ground up, through the water into the air and even beyond to the atmosphere and even our space so i would like to thank every one of you for listening to me. 

Thank you Mrs. K. for giving me the opportunity to speak about this extremely important topic but first I would like to thank my dad for always beliveing in me, my mother for giving birth to me so i could be able to talk about this amazing topic and also for cheering me on my whole life. I would like to give thanks to my grandma from my mother's side for giving birth to my mom and agreeing to her marriage with my father, thanks gramps, he is also from my mother's side, for marrying grandma and sharing your semen with the world and bringing such a fine lady into the world.

Thank you granny and grandpappy, I know you are watching me up there in Heaven, they were very religious, we may have never met but i can feel you cheering me on, and i'd also want to thank thank you for my father.

Well it seems that this three hundred and seventeen word count essay is sadly coming to an end so i would like to thank all of you for standing by me and listening, thank you for your attention and let's hope we'll have the opportunity to expand on this very special topic. 

Thank you!"

# 317 words 1,708 characters

Edit: a little fun non-fact, is that 22x14 (as in the other two speculative stoner comments) would multiply to be just shy of 317. Then if you look at the number of sentences/ lines per paragraph, (at least in this fucked up monitor I'm using) it's 23 lines of text, a few of those not being completely across the comment-window. Making his ~~sentences~~ lines roughly worth 14 words apiece."
16,"I gamble on penny stocks with like 100 here, 200 there. Not K, dollars. But yeah, it’s kinda irritating to get on here and see somebody like, “I YOLO’d my $450k 401k into stock xyz! And I’m like, why? You had *so much* money!"
17,Who thinks I should drop a K on some $GME on open tomorrow morning!🚀🚀
18,"K but we dont call them phone books, we call it the ""emergency syrup supplier list"""
19,"I found this buried in the 10k filing:

>This Form 8-K also disclosed that, pursuant to the Agreement, we agreed that effective at our 2021 annual meeting of stockholders (the “2021 Annual Meeting”), the size of the Board would be reduced from the current 13 directors to nine directors and that the Board would nominate for election the individuals identified in the Form 8-K for election as directors at the 2021 Annual Meeting. **As of the date of this Form 10-K, the Board has not determined the definitive slate of nominees but currently expects that the following incumbent directors will retire from the Board at the 2021 Annual Meeting: Lizabeth Dunn, Paul Evans, Raul J. Fernandez, Reginald Fils-Aimé, William Simon, James K. Symancyk, Carrie W. Teffner and Kathy P. Vrabeck.**

So originally 4 members of the board were leaving at the June board meeting, but now they are listing 8?"
20,"To combat some of the sensationalist articles highlighting the fact that Gamestop does have to ability to issue shares:

From [page 29 of today's 10-K filing](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html), under 

**Liquidity and Capital Resources**


>Based on our current operating plans, we believe that available cash balances, cash generated from our operating activities and net availability under our revolving credit facility **will provide sufficient liquidity to fund our operations for the next 12 months as well as the foreseeable future.**


Yes, the company retains the option to make an ATM share offering, but they are plainly stating that as it stands right now they don't need to do so to raise capital to meet their plans."
21,"The bullshit about “GameStop might issue more shares” is old hat.  Here is the specific text from their [10-K](https://news.gamestop.com/node/18661/html).   It just says that they started the process to issue more shares in December and they haven’t yet.  If they do they will be “at the money” (Remember this was started under the old CFO)

 >Sliders is an American science fiction and fantasy television series created by Robert K. Weiss and Tracy Tormé. It was broadcast for five seasons between 1995 and 2000.

Tormé, Weiss, Leslie Belzberg, John Landis, David Peckinpah, Bill Dial and Alan Barnette served as executive producers at different times of the production.

23,"I wouldn’t expect this to take off like a rocket. There is contribution testing required in K plans, so they will have to issue guidance on how this will factor in. Someone getting a match and making no contribution isn’t really a scenario most plans have today, but it could cause discrimination problems.

That said there will be a lot of work to make things flow as smooth as company match works today. It would be great for students who want to do this though, and I hope it works out ok."

26,"I think most of us are here not to get fat and rich, but literally to pad our accounts so we don't have to stress about living paycheck to paycheck for the next few years. Personally, I feel like if can make just 10k from all of this, I will be alright for a while. Think about that, isn't that some shit? All I could afford was like 700 bucks and all I'm really hoping for is 10 fucking K. That shit is literal crumbs. Fucking crumbs. I dunno, I think that speaks volumes. The fact that a lot of us are here hoping that some tiny little crumblette will feed our kids, will let us quit our shitty miserable jobs, will pay off our credit cards, will buy us a shitty car, will bring our accounts back up to flatline. We aren't in it for power or fame. We aren't too greedy. We just want to fucking live without being in a constant state of: ""will my card get declined while buying dinner tonight?"""

30,"Settle down, moonchild, for my wisdom is brief yet poignant. 

1)If you buy the top, you're the closest to the moon.
2) Roller-coasters are always most fun on the way down.

If all else fails trade only when in the depths of a K-Hole."
31,">trade only when in the depths of a K-Hole.

At last. Actual advice."
32,"I started with Contemporary Castoff, then worked up to Thrift Store Eclectic, then to Warehouse Sale Style, mixed with K-Mart Classic.  In the process, I learned to refinish and upholster furniture.  Even now, when I can afford ""real"" furniture, I still like my rescued treasures best."
33,"We need to take legal action against them in the US and U.K., gather as much evidence as possible, screenshots and everything"
34,"Yep. Fuck taxi businesses and fuck taxi drivers. As someone who's traveled a lot, the amount of bullshit they pull is unreal. Lying about distance, lying about bus times, lying about safety of other means of getting somewhere, changing the cost after the trip, not running the meter, hiding the meter, running the meter up intentionally by taking a longer route, pretending they don't have change and therefore you should just pay the difference, rejecting rides because of destination, upcharging tourists for a trip that locals have said has a standard price. Literally I've experienced each and every one of these personally, and this as someone who takes cabs as a last resort. F-U-C-K T-A-X-I-S."
35,"I don't know about the US, but in the U.K. It's true that you aren't supposed to unnecessarily impede the flow of traffic by going slowly. 

The key word is unnecessarily. In a car, I'd never ordinarily do 25 in a 30. That's bad driving. I also cycle down those same roads at 12mph. 

The fight is the recognition that cyclists, drivers, horse riders, motorcyclists, all have to share the road. And that means realising that we have no right to ask another road user to not use the road or to endanger themselves to let us go faster. 

Without recognising that, any road user that isn't a motorist is totally screwed. "
36,"In the U.K., if an adult is not competent to make medical decisions for themselves, such authority goes to their attending physician. It is good practice to consult family members to ascertain what the wishes of the patient would have been, but not a legal requirement.

That's the medical basis for advising patients to construct a ""living will"" which grants POA if they are not able."
37,"I'm honestly assuming they either are EU citizens with expanded consumer protection laws or they have a truly excellent bank.

Another option is that because Jagex is billed to a foreign country (The U.K.) they wrote it off as fraud.

I tried to go back and play runescape for a month sometime in the last few years for nostalgia and I had a hell of a time getting my midwestern credit union to even approve sending money to Jagex."
38,"Sounds like PPI. We’ve had a decade+ plus long multi billion pound scandal here in the U.K. over card issuers adding it on without asking. All the major banks and card issuers have been forced by regulators to pay back all of the fees they made from this and it has cost them billions in repayments.

0,"Your completely missing the point. Billion banks such as JpM amongst others have been shifting the papers futures market to shore as the price of physical silver. They do this to scalp a few percent on a short position and ensuring their shorts do not expire in the money thus forcing delivery.

If we can force the price up they will be forced to deliver and subsequently (if they don’t have the bullion) they will have to purchase the physical at astronomical prices, killing their bullion books and taking these banks to the cleaners. KEY IS BANKS NOT HEDGES.

These banks are multiple factors larger than Citadel or any other hedge fund. These BANKS are the core of the problem."
1,"Tips for avoiding this:

Use strong passwords, and preferably, 20-character long strings of random letters, numbers, and symbols, kept safe in a [password manager](https://www.dashlane.com/en/im/6GyMqwgT6wvx)*.

Enable [2-Factor Authentication](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358289/two-factor-authentication-who-has-it-and-how-to-set-it-up) (preferably the type which generates a new code on a local device every few seconds, as there exists ways to “hijack” an SMS code).

Regularly perform security checkups, some sites like [Google](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security-checkup?hl=en-US), [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT205064),  [Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/help/799880743466869/) (please don’t use Facebook), and [Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/security) have tools to make this easier. You should check to make sure there aren’t any unrecognized logins or account activity.

Keep your devices and antivirus software up-to-date.

Don’t download software from sketchy developers. This also applies to the Google Play Store, where malicious apps can and do occasionally get through Google’s filters. 

Log off in shared spaces. Don’t be like that guy who left his Facebook account logged in at a Best Buy Store. More practically, any time you get up from your desk quickly hit WINDOWS KEY+L to lock your account.

Don’t get baited by [phishing mails](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/). Designed to appear like they’re coming from a real website, if they say anything important happened with your account, go to that website yourself and check if it’s legit.

*^(*The [linked](https://www.dashlane.com/en/im/6GyMqwgT6wvx) password manager is [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/security), one that I personally trust with over 230+ of my online accounts, and have been paying $3 monthly for the past 3 years. Singing up using the link above does not require you to enter any payment details, and grants you a free 6 month long trial of Dashlane Premium. This also extends my plan by the same time.)*"

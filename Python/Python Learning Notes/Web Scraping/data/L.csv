Still not selling a single share. Either they close their shorts on the cheap from paper handers 🧻🤲 or they pay more in a couple months.

Edit: from paper handers"
1,"The way I see it right now, Wall Street whales chose a battle with the internet. How many battles has the internet lost? I can only think of 1 L with dozens and dozens of Ws. We have the power. Diamond hands. But don’t lose money if you can’t afford to. That’s not what we want."
2,"I'm heavily invested in all the current meme stocks. These hedge fund fucks just want to scare all the new investors that showed up and never been in the red before hoping they'll just take their L's and go home. I pay my mortgage betting on options, **I know how to take a loss and it ain't like this lol.**

6,"I only bought 20 shares @ $486, but you can bet your ass I’m buying any dip sub-$200. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity where we have them in a chokehold and THERE IS NO WAY OUT unless WE sell. They can run this to $10 on fake low volume shit, but they still have to cover eventually. Math doesn’t lie. They went short 140% and we fucking called it before they could get out and instead of taking the L, they doubled down."
7,"It’s not a loss until you sell. WSB went from 2m to 8m in one week. It’s 4X powerful now. Hedges finally got their shit together after the weekend but this ain’t over, not for me 💎🙌

9,"Most people here are too young to remember this happening, or the significance of who did it and why.   
That's a deep wormhole way beyond this summary of sorts.  


""Silver Thursday was an event that occurred in the United States silver commodity markets on Thursday, March 27, 1980, following the attempt by brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt, William Herbert Hunt and Lamar Hunt to corner the silver market. A subsequent steep fall in silver prices led to panic on commodity and futures exchanges.""


""Silver Thursday - Wikipedia"" https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silver_Thursday

The Hunt family includes their uncle, the allegedly most wealthy man of the 20th century, H L Hunt.   I'm well aware that hardly any redditors ever heard of him."
10,"This is how this ends this upcoming week: theres been a lot of buying of short term dated call options on stocks all over the market. There was a lot of unusual options activity the past few days. So what does this mean? While retail has been selling their value stocks to chase a meme fomoing in, algorithms follow that price action & drive the market down to get people to bleed. Notice how GME was up during that entire downturn? Then as the market started recovering a bit GME started a downturn (ladder attack) and they made a killing forcing people to sell their calls through robinhood at some really low prices relative to where they were at open. I am of the belief that other stocks will start to rip this next week & people will fomo into those while GME slowly bleeds throughout the week from a high open. They’re going to propel the market up after accumulating a bunch of paper hand value stocks & options, and then as GME dies down, people are going to have to chase that runaway train that is the market ripping. And when they’ve bought back in high, they’ll get crushed back down again and the house will win. They’re going to keep manipulating the stock. Just my two cents. I’m seeing stuff right now that I only saw at the zealous height of B T C ( 💩c0in) and the “H O D L” mentality. I’m pro GME, but the amount of super bullish unusual options activity on stocks market wide I saw this week leads me to believe this next act will be one of the wilder ones."
11,Goddamn everyone forgot about BB. Guess I'm taking an L on calls next friday.

Hey I am up 2k

Better sell.

Hey I am up another 2k

Better sell before you lose it all.

I am down 6k

Better sell

Fuck rhat. I told her she is a weeping vagina with hands made of linguini and she has no businesswoth us much less giving me advice about it.

Then I doubled down and I am almost all the way back up. This stopped being about money a while ago. After that naked short shit, I accepted my L. This is about sending a message and hopefully bankrupting  hedgefunds."

These are the same people hailing the viking as their savior because he said after the  event that it was due to him, his only proof was a screenshot  of what might as well have been a notepad editor with 2 lines of words that he called ""his algorithm"".

The screenshot DFV posted for yesterday's P/L, his option price change was -$3 (actual price change for that option was -$100), the p/l day had an asterisk next to it and wasn't the expected value.

the place is a brainwashed echo chamber, and i'd like to have my comments in here for when the movie comes out. Maybe they'll ask me to join the filming.

26,"That means they just didn't cover their losses immediately because they hoped that the price is going to go down. At its height they didn't return over 2 million shares on time. Eventually they had to buy them back at a premium and drove up the price and getting their first big L of 2021.

These statistics haven't been updated during the current year so there's no way to know for sure how many shares aren't covered yet.

Judging by the tactics they're pulling they're way more than 3 million."

32,"This is very true. I also disagree with some of these comments about every business not caring. Management definitely gives a shit about staff leaving, I'm in a leadership role and I have retention targets I need to hit. I also need to ensure we meet our HR targets (Pay @ median 90% salary range minimum) to ensure we remain competitive. When I do P&L estimates with our team each year we have to make sure that we are still current on positions for every employee.

I feel like some people here have gotten burned by shitty companies once and are resentful for the remainder of their careers. "

34,"i think im gonna be sick . 

Edit: you did good boys, we lost the squeeze because of manipulation. Doesn't mean we have to lose in the long-run. GME is still transforming its business model with Ryan Cohen, this is what DFV bet on to begin with and DFV is still holding. If you hold shares, just continue to hold, it cannot hurt any more than it already has. Don't hold in the hopes of a squeeze, but that a dying company will reform. Think of Amazon selling books, then realizing their potential and taking full advantage of it. Same with GME here, hold strong brethren, don't take the L!"

You thought you could control us through debt, you thought we’d die from no healthcare, you thought you’d exploit us for every penny at every step.

But you made a critical mistake, you taught us to live with nothing. We have nothing to lose.

44,"Tips for avoiding this:

Use strong passwords, and preferably, 20-character long strings of random letters, numbers, and symbols, kept safe in a [password manager](https://www.dashlane.com/en/im/6GyMqwgT6wvx)*.

Enable [2-Factor Authentication](https://www.pcmag.com/feature/358289/two-factor-authentication-who-has-it-and-how-to-set-it-up) (preferably the type which generates a new code on a local device every few seconds, as there exists ways to “hijack” an SMS code).

Regularly perform security checkups, some sites like [Google](https://myaccount.google.com/intro/security-checkup?hl=en-US), [Apple](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT205064),  [Facebook](https://m.facebook.com/help/799880743466869/) (please don’t use Facebook), and [Microsoft](https://account.microsoft.com/security) have tools to make this easier. You should check to make sure there aren’t any unrecognized logins or account activity.

Keep your devices and antivirus software up-to-date.

Don’t download software from sketchy developers. This also applies to the Google Play Store, where malicious apps can and do occasionally get through Google’s filters. 

Log off in shared spaces. Don’t be like that guy who left his Facebook account logged in at a Best Buy Store. More practically, any time you get up from your desk quickly hit WINDOWS KEY+L to lock your account.

Don’t get baited by [phishing mails](https://phishingquiz.withgoogle.com/). Designed to appear like they’re coming from a real website, if they say anything important happened with your account, go to that website yourself and check if it’s legit.

45,Im with a german trader and can buy and sell. But it’s beyond fucked up to do this. The volume of stocks traded just shot up an our ago and we know it’s them bringing the stock down. It’s so obvious what they’re trying to do. Why can’t they take the L and leave.
46,"I had a driver in LA once too. I remember his name was Max. He was talking about starting his own limousine company and had all these luxury car brochures. I asked him how long he had been working to build this limo company, he said like 13 years. He told me this story about LA having 17M people, the fifth biggest economy in the world and nobody knows each other. He said some guy got on the MTA here and dies. His corpse was doing laps around L.A. for 6 hours, people on and off sitting next to him. Nobody noticed."
47,"I think that the gas being so cheap in the US makes people don't mind too much when buying old cars. A car from the 90s does about 3-9 Km/L when a car nowadays does like 12-14 Km/L, while a hybrid does 16-19 Km/L.

In the end, one is saving up in the car price, but expending almost the double in gas per Km/L (or mile per gallon)."
48,"That's funny, I kinda enjoy taking transit whenever I visit cities that have it. My step kids loved taking the L, because trains are cool. Even taking the bus can be interesting. It sorta doubled as a vacation activity and a cheaper way to get around. "

‚ÄùThe volume is low‚Äù.

What does this mean? The total volume of shares being moved around is LOW. The dips you are seeing are artificial and are NOT due to people selling shares. It‚Äôs illegal market manipulation at its finest.

Hedge funders sell their shares to each other at lower and lower bids (by tiny amounts) in rapid succession using bots. This tricks the algorithm into thinking a shit ton of shares are being dumped = the price is shown to go down.

In reality, no one is selling. Hedge funders are just moving shares between each other. If people were actually selling, you‚Äôd need at least 10x the volume to bring the price down like that.

So, stop panicking pussies. They‚Äôve been doing this all week. Stop staring at your screen and watching every dollar movement. Go for a walk without a phone, have a shower, damn have breakfast if you haven‚Äôt already. Share this info to other newbie traders

Info of volume can be see in level 2 market data, found free on this stream:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQbg_WU-0AQ&ab_channel=StocksBigPlays

WHAT'S TO STOP THEM FROM DOING THIS FOREVER?

Well, unlike us retarded diamond handed monkeys, everyone with a short position has to pay daily interest on their positions to their broker. The longer they wait the more they have to pay to stay in the game. This is a war of attrition, but one side (us) does not have a financial penalty for staying on the battlefield, the other side (those with short positions) do.

2,IM HOLDING. I DONT GIVE A FUCK HOW LOW IT GOES. THOSE ASSHOLES WILL NOT BULLY ME
3,BUY HIGH SELL LOW
4,"**Guys, selling at 1,000 is TOO LOW. Dont do the them the favor. We set the price, they will eventually be forced to cover or continue to suffer serious fucking losses. not financial advice. Please spread this.**"
5,"NO ONE IS SELLING. VOLUME IS INSANELY LOW. [Look at the volume spike at the buy-in vs the sell-off](https://imgur.com/RxRj3zm) IT. IS. FAKE! HOLD!

[It's 2008 again. See this dip? See what came after?](https://imgur.com/a/LMBqqx0)

Is there anywhere we can see the short float in real-time?"
6,"Don't just hold, BUY THE DIP, IT'S LOW NOW! üöÄ üöÄ üöÄ


üíéüôå



This is not financial advice, I'm big dum monke"
7,BUY LOW HOLD HIGH RETARDS
8,"APES WHO BOUGHT AT THE LOW 200 DIP, YOU LUCKY BEAUTIFUL BASTARDS."
9,"compare a current 1 month chart in GME to the short squeeze in VW back in 2008. You would quickly realize that the real squeeze has not squoze. This is a dip that the hedge funds are orchestrating. You were encouraging paper hands in the final hour before the frenzy of buying that is the short bets trying to cover. SHORT INTEREST STILL 120%, THEY WANT TO BUY LOW SO THEY ARE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THIS AND YOU"
10,"I sold some LOW stock in my ESPP that i'll get hit with Short term gains and I'm dumping the proceeds into GME when the money clears. I'm holding with you fucking ape dumbfucks.

&#x200B;

I like the stock."
11,SUCH LOW VOLUME - DONT FRET
12,The post explains it. Price of a stock goes up when there‚Äôs a high demand and low supply. The stock goes down when there‚Äôs high supply and low demand. Wall Street restricting purchase of these stocks creates a FAKE LOW DEMAND. Therefore price goes down. I saw fake low demand because ppl around the world what to buy the stock but are being restricted by their brokers to manipulate the price and make it go down
13,"It‚Äôs should be noted as well, for those whom are thinking of getting in NOW...it‚Äôs likely a day late. 

You retards will forget again, but I‚Äôll reiterate the basic rule. You‚Äôre supposed to buy LOW and then sell HIGH. Not vice versa"
14,"Especially when the liquidation happened at the LOW of the day.

&#x200B;

They should also need to repay every single person who they liquidated (stocks OR options) based on the high of the day yesterday, minimum and in addition to jail time.

&#x200B;

edit: for options, at the high before whatever expiry they had riding.  if it's April calls, then whatever the peak is between now and then."

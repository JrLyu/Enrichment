1,"This is also true in MA and recently, NY. I believe it's up for passing in CA (but don't quote me on that, CA labor laws are their own beast entirely and it's hard to keep up)"

4,"The hedgefunds did this to themselves... None of us worked for Melvin and bought them this shit sandwich... They chose to eat this shit. 

They made a bet that some degenerate dickheads on the internet disagreed with. 

Some bought it cause they are stupid.
Some wanted to use the stock certificates as toilet paper. 
Some dont even know who or what a deepfuckingvalue is? They bought it because GME is a fun word to say...

It doesnt fucking matter why they bought it and no one needs a justification to buy anything in the USA.

They have NO CASE because no one did anything wrong.they just butt hurt cause they got greedy and stupid baked themselves a pile of dogshit and we are forcing them to keep eating it...
Fuck them let them cry.

We like the stock. We have the right to be retarded. Thats how capitalism works...

Saw the secretary of state from MA talking about this is pure speculation. So what if it is? People can buy whatever the fuck they want...

He was talking about ""we need an honest marketplace""

Like the time CNBC and Jim Cramer were telling people to buy Lehman Brothers and AIG on the day they were tanking..."

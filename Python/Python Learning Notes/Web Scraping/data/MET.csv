0,"/u/inktomi is mostly correct. Rocket engines, in my case.

Also, I work on the next-gen combat vehicle. (was called NGCV, now MET-D) This was revealed to the public about a month back, so I can reveal that much. But don't ask for any more details than you can look up online.

But both of those are ITAR, and I gotta be hush-hush. But this really comes down to knowing what's public, and never talking details. Like, I can say I worked on <some piece> if it's been made public. But I cannot give you any details on how, what we did, problems we hit, solutions, etc. Nothing that could give any input on reproducing the technology."

0,Don’t you have a corporate amex for partner meals built into a budget? What the hell kind of company expects you to front. That would make it more like a MLM
1,"BoA is moving to only service high end accounts.  They plan to have no tellers within a few years.  They are requiring you to have online access to maintain your accounts, as soon NOTHING will be able to be done in a branch.  The model is to have only ATMs at various locations.  They have specific branches to handle high end customers (Multi-million) and only at those will there be actual people.  They are currently intentionally under staffing so that it will be slow at the branch to 'train' its customers to bank online.  When you go to a teller or personal banker (they keep changing the titles of their employees) any work they do on your account is actually them pulling up your online account and getting the online department to do the work.  Did you know that soon you will not be able to deposit cash into any account that you do not sign on and never if you personally do not have an account there?  No going to the bank to pay your rent into your landlord's account, etc...CASH will not be good at a BANK.  You will only be able to deposit the cash into your own account and TRANSFER to another account.  I do not understand how these places stay in business.  They are still forcing ridiculous sales numbers on their employees, then immediately ignoring those accounts because those types of accounts are not what they wish to service.  It's like a big MLM scheme.

Credit Union, people.  Get there."
2,"This is pretty hyperbolic. While it is true the competitive landscape is changing in favor of a lower cost online platform, calling the branch model a MLM scheme is bit out of touch.

The old model of retail banking is dying and has been dying for some time. A bank doesn't need a branch on every corner to service its retail customers and an increasing amount of consumer transactions are being done via cashless processes (credit, debit, venmo, online transfers, e-checks, etc). As a result banks are evolving to compete in this new landscape -- if they don't, they will continue to carry high fixed costs while seeing customers flee to online focused banks that can offer better rates as a result of having a lower cost platform. Banks are increasingly closing brick & mortar branches as opposed to opening new ones, and laying off branch staff as volumes decline.

While my banking experience falls outside of the retail side of banking, I'd bet dollars to donuts the limits on which type of ""stranger"" accounts cash can be deposited into has to do with regulatory compliance and wanting to improve the paper trail of cash transfers and deposits to combat money laundering, terrorism financing, etc.

Credit unions are fine, but let's arrive at that conclusion with reasonable logic. "
3,Is it a stock or an MLM jesus christ..
4,Thay would be the worst performing MLM in history. It would be great.
5,"OK here's my genius idea for a new MLM system: you go see a friend, explain you have life-changing financial advice, and you'll share it with them for $50. If they give you the money, you tell them this: ""My advice is to stop giving money to people like me. You just wasted $50. That was stupid. What you should do now is find more friends, make them the same offer I made you, and maybe you'll get your $50 back. Maybe you'll even make extra. Good luck."""
6,"if you use this sub for that then actually you are an ape. What you should is just track the moves for a few select hedgefunds. I prefer citadel because i assume they have that sweet, sweet robinhood data so their moves to exploit wallstreetbets are a little cannier

Citadel suddenly doubles their CLNE? Time to buy CLNE

Ever since GME it's been a good bet. A few hedgefunds up their holdings of ""wallstreetbet darlings,"" the price moves, a few male ""bossbabes"" start spamming wsb with tickers like their very own MLM campaign, the hedge funds up it even more and then FOMO sets in and then its time to cash out

As far as I can tell the only time it hasn't worked is GME because they sold to soon. 

It's big benefit is that I don't think there's been one good non-Citadel ticker. If they don't have shares, and it's on wsb, it's not pumping. In that sense it's probably saved me more money than it's made me when I think about fomo'ing

Also hedgefunds have a lot of capital to send out there. Not everyone can YOLO into CLOV back on May 5 when we learned about this and watch their money bleed out until the right amount of bossbabes and hedgefunds get the pump ready... but if you can throw a few bucks into it, it's not bad 

edit:

next stop? probably rkt again, they doubled their holdings

edit 2: I was about to say their big miss seems to be Riot Blockchain, but then I just checked $RIOT"
7,"A huge number of new followers are dumb boomers and MLM Karens jumping on the bandwagon, trying to ""get rich quick"" through GME. When this storm settle down, you'll see them crying out loud and blaming wsb for ""ruining their lives"". Media will pick up those stories and defame the subreddit telling how amateur redditors organised and harmed so many people.... 

Just wait and watch. A shitstorm is coming."
8,"I know if a Lyft or Uber driver tried to sell me anything like their MLM or financial advising, I would do my best to avoid them in the future."
9,"Yeah, my impression would be that he isn’t a very GOOD financial advisor. 

I think there’s a financial planning MLM. I bet he’s part of that."
10,"**The addendum to this is that there are people who will gaslight you and you talk about how much of a Ponzi scheme Bitconnect is.**

[One particular person is Faith Sloan. She stole about $700k from a MLM scam. She gaslights anyone who says that Bitconnect is a Ponzi scheme. Here's documented proof of it here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7exlqx/so_i_just_found_out_i_was_arguing_with_faith/)"
11,"USI-Tech has four principals:
A Portuguese national that was banned from banking in Europe, 

A German man, living in Brazil, that was involved in the marketing efforts for two other Ponzi schemes that caught the attention of the SEC,

A German man who was the business face, worked for a window manufacturer until he lost his job, 

And one unknown principal.

I performed a due diligence report on the entity when it first came out, and USI-Tech had all the telltale signs of a MLM Ponzi Scheme.

"
12,"Usi tech is a site that wants you to ""invest"" in their btc.  They promise you dividend Payments after so many months and you get bonuses for recruiting other people in.  

It has the making of an MLM or multilevel marketing strategy.  You pay in but you end up on the base. Where your friend that got you into it is up a few steps in the pyramid so they show you they are making money.  You figure what the hell and invest.  

It's not a sustainable business model so at a certain point it implodes and the base is left without their cash."
13,"> you get bonuses for recruiting other people in.

That should have been the big red flashing stop sign right there. As far as I'm concerned, any business that pays people or requires getting more people involved is so clearly a MLM. Even if it's not in 100% of the cases, it's just a stupid idea to take that chance. Seriously, what I quoted is all you needed to write. lol"

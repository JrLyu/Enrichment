1,"> Fucking dumbasses trying to make 100m almost tripped a circuit breaker worth 64 trillion lmao

This is what fucks me up, the upside was a couple of hundred million (i think they still shorted at $ 3 so max gain 78mio shares times 3 if they shorted 100% into the ground). The downside is break the market and go bankrupt. Who approved this trade? This is put options 101. Nobody here would do this trade.

edit: unless these were naked shorts that need the underlying stock to bankrupt otherwise they need to actually borrow a stock. If the company goes bankrupt they never have to actually borrow anything to pay back the lender. So this might be the MO of these hedge funds."
2,BUT ALSO. You have to know that we all profit MO(ASS) the longer we all hold (donâ€™t sell). If youâ€™re just looking for a quick buck and are gonna ðŸ§»ðŸ¤² save yourself the trouble of losing $. If you have ðŸ’ŽðŸ¤² however and will HOLD til $69420 ... welcome aboard ðŸš€.
3,"Nope. Both in the same general area, about 50 miles outside of St. Louis, MO."
4,"Scammer makes money off of the scam.

Say I send you a fake money order for 4,000 dollars, but I only agreed to pay you 2,500. I say that this MO was given to me but I'll sign it over to you and all you have to do is pay me the difference. It's a little weird but you get paid either way so huzza. 

You put the MO in your checking account and the bank fronts the money, but the MO is still pending and hasn't cleared yet. You don't see that, you see your balance has gone up and it appears you have 4,000, so you write your check and send them the 2,500. Later the bank contacts you informing you the MO was fraudulent and suddenly you're in the hole for 2,500, and the scammer makes off with 1,500 with low effort. 

There are variations of this like with OP's GF, a fake company is set up for you to buy products from, but there are no products. You are sending them money for transactions for things that don't exist. It would be like if you paid to have things sent to you from Amazon but the goods never arrived and you couldn't get your money back. Instead of the fake MO and the person sending the difference, they think they are getting paid to buy things for their new job. The advantage for the scammer is it could take days for the person getting scammed to realize they are being had. They would have paid all this money to this fake company, the MO would bounce, and the scammer under the guise of being an employer could milk the situation until the scammed realizes what's going on and then 'poof', the scammer and the fake company vanishes, and the scammed is left in debt with no job. 

If you had a bunch of these going at once you could rip off many people."
5,"It's a really common scam. The ones I've gotten hit with is person is traveling and they have a money order for X dollars that they can send you and they want you to pay the difference. There's another where if you sell anything as a small business (I was doing pet portrait commissions for a while online), they will ask to buy whatever you got but want you to use a shipping company you've never heard of. One guy emailed me with both, wanting to send a MO for things he saw on my website but a few thousand over what they were worth and he wanted me to ship using a company I had never heard of that would 'pick up from my house' I just needed to give them all of my info. 

I agree, doesn't make sense, but people fall for it all the time. People wouldn't be doing it if it didn't work. First time I got hit with one of these I thought it was suspicious but I wanted to see how far it would go. As soon as he told me he was sending me a MO for thousands over the amount, & I told him I wasn't going to do that. They got real aggressive with me over email, threatening me with the police even (lol). I blocked them and that MO never arrived. "

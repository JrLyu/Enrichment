0,"Squeezing silver is not like squeezing GME where the target is Melvin.

Squeezing silver is a boss fight - you're going up against JPM, Citi, BAC, MS. Completely different ball game.

Also already lost $7k trying to play SLV in August."
1,i miss the days of MS Paint
2,"Christ on a fucking stick guys, what did you think was going to happen? A game changing earnings call? Ryan Cohen coming in on a rainbow unicorn of game changing news to trigger the MOASS? This is fucking war and we are up against people who will spend almost everything they have to prevent losing everything. That’s their end game. There is literally no reason for the HFs to not use their massive amount of resources to drag this out because they will either A) lose everything by giving up now
Or B) spend as much as they can to prevent losing everything to minimize their losses. 

Losing 90% of what they have to prevent losing 100% is their plan. And they have have a lot of fire power and time. 

If you’re in, just fucking holdor. If you’re in, you shouldn’t have put in more than you are willing to lose. 
If you’re in, you should also believed GME is a good long play. 

HFs are smart guys. They hire fucking mathematicians, engineers, computer scientists, physicists and shit to develop analytical and quantitave strategies for them while big dicks with MBA/BAs make all the money in their management positions they landed because of their Ivey league network. 
 
I literally got into a screening process for a quant internship for IMC trading a few months ago. 

They gave me timed prescreening pattern recognition and problem solving questions that my smooth ass ape brain simply couldn’t solve and I have a fucking math degree and I’m in the middle of my MS degree in Analytics (degrees don’t make you smart folks). They had me playing fucking video games that tested my reaction time and how quickly I can process information. It then generated a fucking 10 page report describing the levels of smoothness each part of my brain has. Not kidding. 

Know your enemy, they don’t even fucking bother interviewing people unless they are geniuses. They knew the earnings call was coming. They have a lot of money. They are smart. 

Just fucking holdor. You’re in it to win it. They only win if you sell. 

Not financial advise, I just like the stock all that shit"
3,"Mine went into a coma-like state where it wasn't completely switched off but at the same time didn't do anything. It seemed like the device was dead. MS support basically said something along the lines of ""we don't know, too bad, buy a new one"". Then after I bought a new laptop(from a different manufacturer of course) suddenly that damn thing started working again after its battery was drained completely, resetting everything.

The shitty thing about this is that even if you know what the problem is, you can't do anything about it because not even Microsoft themselves can open these fuckers without damaging something. So you basically have to wait for the battery to drain on its own and hope you don't need it until then."
4,MS Edge gives %78 as well
5,Are you saying you can open a bank account under 21 in those states? Because you definitely can open a bank account at 18 in MS.
6,"Going through that right now.  Our contracted software developers havne't hit a single date in the three years they have been working on this project.  They've been trying to figure out a printing issue for about 6 months now, it's a MS product but they won't call MS for help with it.  And our CIO just keeps signing off on the invoices and says ""well they are the experts, we just need to follow their lead.""  Mean while, if one of our vendors doesn't hit a date for something or it doesn't perform how he feels it should he won't pay a single invoice until it's resolved to his satisfaction.  Which sucks, because it's usually his fault the stuff doesn't work right (bought cheaper lower performance hardware than was recommended). "

0,"They didn‚Äôt come for us when we were burning our money on **MSFT 200C**s. We weren‚Äôt a problem when we lost it all to the ‚Äú**quad witching**‚Äù on SPY puts. 

Retail is only a problem because we are winning. They don‚Äôt want to protect us; just themselves, now that they realize they don‚Äôt hold all the answers. 

The real problem is naked short selling on leverage. Retail will be the scape goat and Melvin will get a bail out. This is how it goes. The little man holds the bags for the ass hole institutional investors with no risk management. Just like 08 when the big players get a bailout and retail loses half of their pension. We play to our *personal risk tolerance*. They leverage to the tits and lose to ultimately walk away without a scratch. 

**Guh**"
1,MSFT 200c *shudders*
2,"I thought it was MSFT 220c? Man, so many people got fucked with that cause of the rona"
3,I'm a proud member of MSFT 200c gang who bought at $198 üíéüôåüèº
4,"Nah, 1ronyman was in in November 2019 iirc and MSFT was in January/February after the TSLA 700C (iirc) actually fucking worked."
5,"another fun sorting would be investments to committees held. id love to see the banking committee buying fintech, defense buying MSFT/LMT, and so on and so on"
6,"WSBer here for like 2-3 years now (for perspective, I have like 100k karma from here), normally I expect like 20% of the ""serious"" content to be written in bad faith.  Now, it's more like 90% and it includes memes that are supposed to drive emotion.  I fear a lot of new people are going to be led to their doom.

For all the newcomers, this is a casino - nothing is guaranteed and don't bet what you can't afford to 100% lose.  I have this flair for a reason, I've seen *a lot* of bloodbaths.

Edit: Shout outs to PRPL, LL, MSFT 195C, RKT, and tanker gangs

Edit2: Stop wasting awards on me and either buy GME or donate to a charity"
7,"MSFT 200c, SPY 150p. I called fuckery days ago. WSB is a loss porn subreddit first and foremost. I'm enjoying the ride, but expecting the usual bloodbath that comes from this sub hitting the news"
8,"I love Elon,  but honestly Bill Gates has a bigger positive impact on the world than Elon musk‚Äôs Tesla and Spacex and I am not even counting his philanthropic activities. Sadly for Elon, that impact will be keep continuing. Wish he hadn‚Äôt sold his MSFT shares though. Bad decision."
9,"#My humble proposal:

(I would do it if I had the skill)

- Someone should code a bot or a few bots to respond to random posts with random or otherwise obfuscating stock positions.

- I say random because I'm unsure of whether targeted but insincere positions could be seen as manipulation. If not, then target them and change the targets every so often.

- This would help scramble the algorithms by giving them junk data.

- This would further fuck over wall street because they'd be getting junk information and have already paid out or entered into contracts for access to that data (not sure which way it works).

- This would fuck over the people producing the algorithms because it would cast doubts on their methodology and the usefulness of employing their services. Hopefully, this would help stop the practice before it becomes mainstream.

#Alternatively, we should all adopt the convention of signing off our posts with random janky stock positions.

- Example:

Buy TSLA, Sell MSFT, Short XRX

- We would all know this was nonsense, but skimmers wouldn't.

- Could mods even put this suggestion in the side bar? I don't think it's illegal to try to counteract algorithms if it's not explicitly coordinated (like, everyone put exactly X, Y, Z in their post). Once again, if that's not the case, then target them and change the targets every so often.

**Feel free to add to, refine, or share this idea. I'm dumb and have no idea what I'm doing.**"
10,"Remember when NFLX sent you DVDs in the mail? One day I‚Äôll say, remember when GME sold games in a store? Hang in there. When that time comes GME will have a 25B market cap. EA and ATVI will one day partner with a streaming service provider. SONY and MSFT can‚Äôt dominate all that bandwidth forever. üöÄüëÄ

11,"I'm a theta guy joining in to fight the good fight.  MSFT, AAPL and FB have earnings in the next couple of days. Once those earnings plays print that'll free up a lot of capital for a lot of people. You glorious bastards just need to hold the line.

You had my curiosity, but now you have my attention."

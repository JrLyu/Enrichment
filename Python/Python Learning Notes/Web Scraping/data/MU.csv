0,I know it's sad. I used to mod here back in 2017/18/19 and spend hours a day posting before my son was born in March 2019 and all my free time disappeared and they eventually removed me because I stopped doing anything. My old account was poopDOLLLA. We had 200-300ish thousands users back then and MU was all the rage (RIP marty). It's unfortunate but I don't think WSB is ever going to be the same after this insane growth. Maybe in a year or so after these millions of new people lose interest again

Those were the good old days, simpler times, when it was all about Sue Bae and MU...

I'm more of a buy and hold guy. But I used to be active on WSB a long time ago, and these guys clued me into getting SQ when it was 30. I'm still holding that one. And then I bought MU when it was low, sold at 62 something about 3 years ago. 

It is possible to separate the wheat from the chaff here."

11,This sub went down here since GameStop IMO.  Iâ€™ve been here for years. And man do I miss the days of $MU
12,The dude started with 100k and put an additional 50k into this each year. I was pretty active a few years back when MU and AMD were big meme stocks and I don't remember seeing too much good advice on here. So maybe it was before then. Or I just forgot.
13,You forgot to tell them to dump everything in JNUG and MU

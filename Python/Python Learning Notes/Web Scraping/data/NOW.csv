1,"That OR, and hear me out, they put out a paper about why a stock is bad and why they're shorting it, knowing that it will be circulated and listened to because of their manipulation, erm I mean, influence and authority on the market

We all know what usually happened next.. UNTIL NOW! 

(If you don't know what usually happened: They tell you the shirt you're wearing is tacky. You, believing they are telling you this to help you, decide to sell the shirt. Once they've  stripped you butt naked, you see them walking around in your shirt, the same one they said was unfashionable. And get this, they're so generous they'll let you buy your own shirt back for more than you paid for it in the first place.)

I should've said socks, not shirts. Socks were the obvious choice.. my bad boys."
2," IAM A  RETARD WHO WENT ALL-IN ALREADY @ 224, AND STARING AT THE STOCK NOW WITH AN EMPTY POCKET...POCKETS TOOK SUCH A DEEP HOLE, I ONLY HAVE MY NUTS LEFT !"
3,"REMINDER BEFORE BED: 

Today we saw an unprecedented, almost-nuclear option attempt to get us out.

And we may see it again tomorrow. Or something similar, and unexpected.

REMEMBER: When it comes, NOW YOU'VE SEEN IT BEFORE. You're TRAINED. You're READY. YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

SAY IT WITH ME:

üíé FUCKING üôåüèº

DO NOT FUCKING SELL."

#I KNOW YOU WANT TO SELL & SECURE YOUR PROFITS TOMORROW.  

#I KNOW YOU WANT TO ENJOY YOUR WEEKEND WITHOUT WORRYING ABOUT MONDAY. CONGRATS, NOW YOU KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE A RETARD DEGENERATE MOMMY BASEMENT LIVING TRADER.

BUT HEAR ME OUT...

But if you want the god damn change we  have been seeking for decades, here is your biggest shot at exterminating that hornet‚Äôs nest. Just hold, don‚Äôt give into fear and greed. We must stay unified if this action against corporate corruption.

#üíé2021üíé IS OUR FUCKING YEAR. I AM TIRED OF BEING TREATED LIKE DOG SHIT, AND BANKS USING OUR OWN MONEY FOR THEIR OWN GREEDY PURPOSES WITH THE RISKS WEIGHED ON OUR HANDS.

7,"God I miss the old WSB.

The WSB where everyone was in pure option plays for an earnings play or long-term play, and we'd laugh at the fucking idiot who had a week to go on his 1 yr call option, sitting at -95%... Only for that mother fucker to hit 300% on that very friday.

WSB'ers know the game. They know what it's like to be hurting, squeezing for adding in more margin, getting in that last contract even though you're a blow away from GUHing your future. Know what we'd do? ""Just delete the app, restart!""

You morons are crying about going down 30 and 40%? No. You're already a paper holding F*G**T. If you didn't have the confidence of knowing that you may be down 80% tomorrow, but will be up 300% at the end of the week, then you shouldn't of been in this trade in the first place.

This is a kind of trade financial advisors scream at you for doing because its idiotic, foolhardy, and plain retarded. That's why this will *work*. BUT ONLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME BEING PLAYED.

So shut up about your paper handing bullshit because no one wants to hear it. The OG's have been through it, we've all suffered bigger losses before, but the reason it's an echo chamber is because THERE HAS NEVER BEEN AS SURE OF A THING THAN RIGHT NOW! So pull that dildo out of your asshole you gay bear and BUY $GME"
8,"I'm going to start repeating this as many times as possible:

FOR THESE HEDGE FUNDS, LEGALITY IS IRRELEVANT. ALL THAT MATTERS IS PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL. CAPITAL BUYS POLITICIANS, REGULATORS (YELLEN lol), AND LAWYERS TO DELAY AND DIMINISH ANY POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCES. CAPITAL LETS THEM TRADE $100 BILLION IN LOSSES TODAY FOR A $100 MILLION FINE A YEAR FROM NOW. BATTEN DOWN THE HATCHES AND EXPECT THIS TO FIGHT TO CONTINUE."
9,GME is effectively a referendum on shorts. We DO NOT live in a Democracy but an OLIGARCHY. NOW IS YOUR TIME TO VOTE WITH YOUR DOLLARS AND FUCKING BANKRUPT THESE ABSOLUTELY PARASITIC SCUM.
10,"The free floating stocks (49% of the company, tradable by the public) are the stocks the company(Gamestop) sold to the public (the market).  
The majority (51%) they kept for themselves to keep the majority of the comapny (duh).  
So ""the over 100%"" that you stated are over 100% of the public stocks !!! NOT overall stocks !  
The company(Gamestop) will hold their 51% forever(to keep the majority).  
So NOW the public has to WANT to sell ""A F**KING WHOLE OF A LOT"" or else they(the hedge fund) can't close their positions(they have to buy)(witch they 100% have to).  
And if they 100% have to (wich they do) they have to buy at EvEry price (litteraly every).  
This will happen in the next days (not now and not tomorrow).  
So 1000-10000 is as strange as it sounds in reach, if nobody sells.  
If you found this useful, please share it with others. Apes together stronk !"
11,BLOCK THOSE SHORTS OUT.  THE LITTLE YOU PAY NOW WILL BE PEANUTS COME MONDAY!!!!!!!!
12,"NOW WE HOLD! THE BIGGEST WAVE OF ATTACK IS ON THE WAY, THIS IS THE MOST CRUCIAL TIME!

14,"Hijacking top comment to post this.

Alright everyone listen up. I‚Äôm tired of the bullshit, you‚Äôre tired of the bullshit, were all tired of the bullshit, including everyone of the working class that aren‚Äôt even in GME, BB, NOK, BBBY, and AMC. There is so much universal disgust with Wall Street that the likes of AOC, Ted Cruz, Donald Trump Jr. Ro Khanna, Ted Lieu, and Robert Reich all agree that what we saw yesterday is blatant market manipulation.

We need to get the word out that the Short-Sale Rule is already a precedent of regulation by the SEC. If you don‚Äôt know what it is, click here: [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/shortsalerule.asp)

We need to get the word out that the SEC has the power to implement SSR on all our favorite stonks RIGHT NOW. Twitter, instagram, Reddit, and directly contacting your local congressional representatives and senators and demand that the SEC immediately enforce the SSR to prevent continued market manipulation. WSB is not political but both sides of congress are on our side right now and we absolutely cannot let this crucial moment slip to get the justice we deserve after yesterday.

If you do not know who your congressional representative is, click here: [https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative](https://www.house.gov/representatives/find-your-representative)

You can use the following when they take your comment:

**""I strongly urge congress to call on the executive branch and the SEC to implement and enforce the Short-Sale Rule on heavily shorted stocks to protect retail investors.""**

Say whatever else you want, but that is the key phrase that needs to be used. I also mentioned that this is currently charging up a tremendous amount of distrust in American markets that has the potential to devastate our economy on the world stage.

We are on the edge of glory and we have the numbers to push their hand and get the entire country behind this to prevent the abusive short ladder attacks we‚Äôve been seeing all week.

GET THE FUCKING WORD OUT. I like this stock way too much to not see it grow up and reach its full potential because of billionaire hedge funders strategically unwinding their positions through a series of short ladder attacks instead of letting the squeeze play on as it would in a truly free market.

Feel free to copy/paste this and spread it through the subreddit for all to see.

19,"For anyone watching the situation on GME, please also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1.	‚Å†Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.
2.	‚Å†After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done to make us sell GME and spin the narrative that the complicit agents are victims / good guys.
3.	‚Å†Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.
4.	‚Å†Hedges might lie about their short positions, or restrict visibility as much as possible. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Someone pointed out that iborrowdesk is no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.
5.	‚Å†We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.
6.	‚Å†If you set visible limits, the hedge funds can use this data to their advantage and potentially have attack vectors against us. However, if you don't set limits, you might miss out on major trading spikes when they happen. The selfless act is to avoid low limits, but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it.
7.	‚Å†If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts AFTER this is over so that you're not frozen. Then consider moving to SoFi, since Chamath is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and is offering probably the best alternative.
8.	‚Å†If you're angry at Google for removing negative Robinhood accounts, use Ecosia instead. They're just as user friendly, effective, and they give 80% of their profits to green energy and planting trees. Google will lose hundreds or thousands of dollars per year from your ad revenue and data collection.
9.	‚Å†Join a class action lawsuit against Robinhood to leverage the losses from the day you couldn't buy GME. Document evidence of owning GME (it will be in your Robinhood history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, you should join as a Named Class Representative for outcomes specific to you. These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud. Details are still coming.
10.	‚Å†It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand REAL consequences for this criminal behavior. This matters.

You're welcome to exchange this info freely if you find it useful. I am not a financial advisor, yadda yadda, you know the drill."

Also dont forget that this wasn‚Äôt a sub that ‚Äúmakes people money‚Äù and ‚Äúscrews over hedge funds‚Äù. This used to be about FDs, loss porn, and huge fucking gains on stupid bets.

This sub has grown 4.5m since I joined, and it should be mentioned to all people new here THIS IS NOT THE SOLUTION to investing. 

There are some really smart people here, but DO NOT think every post will be a new stock like this. This is a unique situation at a point in time and certainly will be in the financial history books. But this is NOT INVESTING ADVICE. Go back even 6 months and look at the posts.

This is a phenomenal community of autists looking to get yachts, hookers, and tendies on high risk high reward trades. But don‚Äôt think kind of event will happen every week, if ever again.

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! üíéüôåüöÄüöÄüöÄ**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**üöÄ** **üöÄüöÄüöÄ** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

23,"THIS IS NOW PERSONAL AND I AM HOLDING. üíé‚úã


I'm holding on with üíé‚úã for everything I couldn't hold on to in 2020. Like so many others last year, my life was completely screwed over by Covid. I lost my job. I lost my dream home and living situation. I lost my carefully laid plans. Worst of all, I lost the man I love. I had to move back in with my parents. I had no income for most of the year. I had to cope with a devastating breakup while social distancing from friends. 


Life has been absolute hell, and if the choices had been mine, I would have held on with üíé‚úã to all of the things I lost last year. I would have held onto my job. I would have held on to my dream home. I would have held on to my partner. My god, I would have held him my whole life if he had let me. Those things were out of my control. I could not hold on to them, but dammit, I can hold on to this. üíé‚úã I feel empowered being able to simply hold onto something I like. And I like the stock. üöÄ I did my DD. 


I'm a newbie trader, but the dips haven't made me flinch one time. They are doing everything they can to scare us into selling, but I don't have no üßª‚úã. I put my unemployment check into this stock, and I'm like freaking Maya Angelou over here. I shall not be moved. Just try to pry my GME stock out of my üíé‚úã.

Melvin and Citadel wanna do psychological warfare to that dude to cover for their fuck up? Fuck them and fuck that. I'm not having that shit.

This isn't about a stock, its about people coming out of one of the shitiest years imaginable for working class folks with a leg up for once. Fuck Citadel. Fuck Melvin. Fuck MM's.

Guys that got in at like $7 are 6,7,8 figures rich NOW"
75, YESSSSSSSSSSSS! BEARS R LITERALLY FUK NOW üòç welcome back zjz üíô
76,"Everyone should also consider these relevant points and taking the relevant actions:

1. Big money is MORTIFIED and the retaliation is completely unprecedented: coordinated attacks, willingness to risk prison over financial loss, concealing data, etc. They're shaking because we're holding GME. Despite any other lack of information available, this may be the best signal for why you should hold. Period.

2. After the massive GME rise, there was a LOT of bot activity trying to distract, dissuade, misinform, etc. They're poisoning the well, and it's difficult to know what can be trusted and what can't, and there are likely attempts to hype up other stocks that don't realistically have anywhere close to the same potential. The one thing we DEFINITELY know, however, is that all of those attacks are being done because we are holding GME.

3. Robinhood + Citadel are trying to spin a BS narrative to cover up things going much deeper. If your institution can't afford something, shut everything down equally and go bankrupt. Choosing a specific stock to shut down is perhaps the most egregiously corrupt action ever taken in the market (which is saying A LOT). YOU weren't allowed to buy when major funds were, especially at CRITICAL times with CRITICAL buying opportunities to protect Citadel + big money and it collectively cost us tens (or hundreds?) of billions in lost opportunity. They're being sued, and rightfully so, but laws need to change to ruthlessly punish them NOW. Contact your representatives, SEC, etc. if you haven't already.

4. Hedges might lie about their short positions and the data is extremely difficult to access, which is why we're in this situation. They can break laws and face negligible fees by comparison to the rest of what they stand to lose. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume they might do this among many other PR stunts to terrify you. Keep updated. Some places (like iborrowdesk) are no longer reporting on updated gme because, again, the legal consequences don't matter enough and they're protecting their interests. Refer to #1.

5. We don't know WHEN short positions will be covered, only the math that requires them to cover as we move forward. So if they delay and everyone gives in, they could save a lot of money. However, the longer they delay, the more they have to pay. So it's a matter of whether or not they double down and face higher risk/reward or not. Be prepared to WAIT.

6. Setting your shares with limits means there are less shares to short, which increases the fees that those shorts have to pay. This helps with the squeeze. The selfless act is to avoid low limits (at least at first), but the ultimate goal is to distribute wealth to the people so take if you're the people who need it. Otherwise institutions holding might sell at higher rates than you do, which defeats the point.

7. If you're angry at Robinhood, move accounts to hurt their bottom line. However, during transfer you'll be unable to trade, so you have to decide if that's worth it to you in this moment. Some have suggested doing partial transfers. Consider moving to SoFi. Like all brokers, it's tied into the system, but Chamath is entering the game and is perhaps the one major CEO that's on our side here and probably offering the best option.

8. There's a lot of talk about Robinhood going insolvent. I can't tell if this is FUD or not, but the market value of GME even now is miniscule compared to everything else they cover. So I don't follow the logic how they're supposedly in financial trouble. If it DID go insolvent (not saying it will), people might only be compensated for up to 250k or 500k. The medium guys will get screwed if RH becomes a sacrifice to avoid much bigger losses. I don't know what to do with this information yet, but it should be on your radar.

9. Be prepared to join a class action lawsuit if you owned any GME, AMC, etc, but let some more information feed in first. We're uncovering more of this each day. A lot of focus has been Robinhood, but it goes deeper as well. Robinhood and other institutions' actions were blatant market manipulation. Document evidence of owning the stocks (it will be in your broker's history), or any intent of it such as on Reddit about your intent to buy stocks before they locked trading. If you owned a lot, consider joining as a Named Class Representative for financial returns specific to your case (rather than just what everyone gets). These are civil cases to redistribute wealth back to you, and could be significant. Only sign up in one class action suit or it could be considered fraud.

10. Be cautious about buying at times when institutions can anticipate it and control how they handle your buy orders, such as market open. It's a major gamble if you're not setting limits. Consider letting the stock dip before you buy because we can expect a lot of attempts to make that happen. It's better to us all if you get more stocks, but the institutions are notoriously hard to beat at this game. They are, generally speaking, much better at this, and they cheat to imbalance everything.

11. It's hard to anticipate what other stunts will be pulled to try to screw us over or how deep this goes. There's new information suggesting there might be a lot of counterfeit stocks, which has historical precedent with Fannie Mae. See [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/) for the full report. Contact your representatives, particularly those in finance committees and demand investigations and REAL consequences for these criminal behaviors. This matters.

12. It's also worth investigating the other grossly unfair (some technically legal, some illegal but easily concealed) attack vectors they use against us: flow orders, hidden data, AI algorithms, etc. They always win because the game is rigged. Shorting should be illegal. Please remember that this is more than about making money, it's about a movement. Demand these things be changed.

13. For everyone saying hold until zero, that is a potentially dangerous sentiment. Holding may very well expose a lot of corruption, but those in financial need should not be risking their life savings. The goal is to distribute wealth to the PEOPLE, which means some of you should have an exit strategy or the institutions just win 100% of it.

14. Absolutely ESSENTIAL reading: [What is Counterfeit Stock](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html), [if the institutions counterfeited GME stock, it explains Wallstreet's terror](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l97ykd/the_real_reason_wall_street_is_terrified_of_the/). We need to be paying close attention to the Depository Trust Clearing Corp (DTCC) and how strongly they resist allowing ANY data to be seen and how they resist investigation. Please read up.

77,"Yea people seem to be missing the bigger picture. Say 5 redditors realize whats happening now is happening with their local banana seller. He has given them IOUs for 50 bananas each but wait...only 100 exist..ok so redditor 1 gets there first and says yo i want my shares, ok he gets them. Redditor 2 same thing. Now 3 4 and 5 all show up and they paid for 50 fucking bananas and you better believe harambe gonna get them. Doesnt matter that the bananas didnt exist, the banana dealer is insured. So the banana distributor now has to go ok ill pay you for the current price of bananas and destroy the IOUs (In reality this is gonna be waaaaay messier with lawsuits and all sorts of shit). Now the correct amount is in circulation again and every either has bananas to trade at market price or equivalent cash.

NOW, the way they wanted this to play out was GME to bankrupt, get a huge payday and then slowly phase out the fake stock over time no one the wiser. Just buy it back for pennies on the dollar and remove it from the books all in house ez pz. But now we know they did it. They cant do it again and they cant make it go away. And guess what...

Ever heard a company tell you not to buy their own shares because you‚Äôll lose all of it? 

I hate to say this, but some of you guys need to hop the hell out of AMC at market open. They are issuing 11,000,000 new shares, diluting existing stock, and I guarantee you that you are going to start seeing AMC insiders cashing out since AMC management holds a little over 7% of total stock. This is no GME where there was at least some substantial institutional shareholders like BlackRock.

Technically, the losses on these short hedge funds can be infinite as the price of the underlying securities increase.  The entire retail sector has just been told by their brokerages ‚Äúyou cannot buy these stocks, or you can only buy a certain amount, or on certain days‚Äù as a result.

Bitcoin‚Äôs entire appeal is that it is an anti-establishment coin that‚Äôs value comes from its scarcity (21M coins).  There are hundreds of platforms to buy this security on - even BTC ATMs in malls and such.

Now that retail is being told they can only hold a limited quantity of that list I just sent you, the hypothetical demand for these stocks has never been higher.  People will open multiple brokerage accounts to buy the theoretical maximum on each.  The whole game is flipped because (and this is hilarious to even say) *GAMESTOP STOCK IS NOW RARER THAN BITCOIN.*

Hedge funds and financial institutions want the shares to cover their own or other firm‚Äôs short plays and retail wants the shares to fight the whole system at their own game.  This is insane.  What do you think?"

This morning I, and millions of other retail investors, were blocked from purchasing (entering new buy orders) on the Robinhood platform, without notice. This clear example of market manipulation has forced the stock down from over $500 in after-hours to less than $300 as of this writing. Meanwhile, hedge fund interests are NOT blocked from buying the shares being traded and the lower price obviously benefits them. 

We retail investors have followed all the rules and finally stood to gain a LITTLE bit from Wall St and they suddenly change the rules ""to protect"" us. I am requesting you use your subpoena power and regulatory authority to examine whether Robinhood colluded illegally with any other actors who may have held short positions on these stocks to reduce the number of buyers for $GME and therefore deflate the price. This is market manipulation.

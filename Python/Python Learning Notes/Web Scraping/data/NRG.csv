0,"Being bluntly honest

If the the point of no return truly is 2035 or even 2050 we have to adopt nuclear power ASAP.
1 MW is 300 tons of coal vs 1 gram of uranium
We have millions of tons of uranium on the planet(so we wonâ€™t run out for a minute)

The Biden administration has slightly increased funding for nuclear power, but the truth is the EPA just has to loosen up and let energy companies construct plants. NRG a few years ago has their nuclear project shutdown because of Fukushima. Ridiculous that our government is preventing energy companies from opening nuclear plants."

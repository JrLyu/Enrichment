6,"Bingo. Like Kevin O'Leary always says, it's about the money. There's no room for emotion. Money doesn't care."
7,"This is how this ends this upcoming week: theres been a lot of buying of short term dated call options on stocks all over the market. There was a lot of unusual options activity the past few days. So what does this mean? While retail has been selling their value stocks to chase a meme fomoing in, algorithms follow that price action & drive the market down to get people to bleed. Notice how GME was up during that entire downturn? Then as the market started recovering a bit GME started a downturn (ladder attack) and they made a killing forcing people to sell their calls through robinhood at some really low prices relative to where they were at open. I am of the belief that other stocks will start to rip this next week & people will fomo into those while GME slowly bleeds throughout the week from a high open. They‚Äôre going to propel the market up after accumulating a bunch of paper hand value stocks & options, and then as GME dies down, people are going to have to chase that runaway train that is the market ripping. And when they‚Äôve bought back in high, they‚Äôll get crushed back down again and the house will win. They‚Äôre going to keep manipulating the stock. Just my two cents. I‚Äôm seeing stuff right now that I only saw at the zealous height of B T C ( üí©c0in) and the ‚ÄúH O D L‚Äù mentality. I‚Äôm pro GME, but the amount of super bullish unusual options activity on stocks market wide I saw this week leads me to believe this next act will be one of the wilder ones."
8,"Can confirm that I bought GME because I like the stock. It is coincidence that you also like the stock. We must both have independently come to this conclusion using available market information as any normal investor can do.

12,"This might be why Chamath, Elon, that Stjern group on Twitter, Portnoy, Cuban, O'Leary, etc. have been so vocal  about this ordeal. These billionaires are very well connected and have better information networks than the average Joe. 

People might want to pay attention to their investments and see if they pull out of anything in large quantities, that will be indicative of what's about to occur."

14,"Oil's also very interesting right now.

There are only 3 certainties in life.

Death, taxes and government policy's effect on asset prices.

Oil price is the most obvious example in recent years. The Saudi and Russian governments went to war on market share by flooding the Oil market back in March 20, and for a brief moment in time in April Oil futures went negative. Then the Saudi and Russian governments suddenly agreed to cut supply (gee what could have possibly caused that), and on the days that followed the best 100% odds of winning trade of the decade was born. 

And now, in the last few days, the White House demanded that the Saudis increase supply to stop the price of oil from rising any further. That resistance zone at 70 is now backed up by a couple of US carrier fleets. It's a case of ""sell us your oil or we kill you, but sell us too much and we also kill you."" Or in other words, business as usual.

And they call us apes. O wait, we call ourselves apes.

TL/DR: This isn't financial advice, more the mad ramblings of a semi-retarded, bare assed baboon, but you could say it's not the worst time to be shorting Oil futures right about now. The $50-70 a barrel range seems to be where it's at. Then when the FUD hits and Oil price bounces off the $50 support zone, yolo into Oil stocks!"

Sorry for the basic questions, just trying to undestand SEC influence on this matter."

55,"Thanks for this, you made it easy, my experience as a NY State resident: I started at 1130pm, finished before midnight. 

TransUnion: 10 mins, create an account, username/password and pin, enter personal info and answer random security questions from credit history, confirmed freeze.

Experian: 5 minutes, enter personal info, answer random questions from credit history, was assigned a pin with confirmation of freeze.

Equifax: 5 minutes, entered personal info, was asked if I was certain I wanted to freeze, checked yes, was assigned a pin with confirmation of freeze.

Ridiculous not to even try to confirm I am who I am. Anyone, A..N..Y..O..N..E.. with my name, address and social could have frozen my credit! 

Now Im even MORE annoyed at Equifax on top of everything else. Clearly negligent. "
56,"That's not what they mean. Consider this: a new credit card gives you 50k points for spending $3k in 3 months. On that first $3k spend, you got 50k points, plus at least 3k with 1% back. Then on the next $3k you spend, you only get 3k points. The idea is to keep getting new cardmember bonuses, because you will get 10-20x more points this way.

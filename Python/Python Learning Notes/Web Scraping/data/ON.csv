0,"Exactly. This is all a part of their game plan. They'd rather get sued for a loss of say 2.5 billion because you couldn't buy at 300 and sell when it peaked at 1000(hypothetical) which is most you can prove legally, rather than give retail the ability to buy more and possibly create infinite losses. 
This is what they need to do make sure they don't have to liquidate all their assets and go bankrupt. Take a one time lump sum loss.
This won't be the only loss they take though if 💎✋. You don't need to sell your Robinhood stocks to buy at other brokers though. If you were going to buy more on Robinhood, create a Fidelity account (Fidelity still allows buying) and buy there. It's all commission free. It doesn't even sell your data. On top of it, raise Robinhood customer requests to transfer your shares to Fidelity.

6,"I was little when the recession hit, but I remember bits and pieces. I remember my grandparents losing their car dealerships, my dad losing his job at said dealerships, my Mom returning to work as a teacher. I didn't know the extent to how bad things were until recent years. I remember one day in freshman year of high school, I was having a mental and emotional breakdown. My dad leveled with me in a way he never had before. He admitted to me that when we lost the dealerships, he went on unemployment, and things were getting pretty bad. He admitted to me (something I don't even think he told my mother) that he was extremely close to just getting into a ""car accident"" and supporting us with his life insurance.

I've had the fortune of not actually seeing him in that state, and I intend to keep it that way. I'm not a tankie or anything, I fully believe in and support capitalism, but I genuinely hope these mushroom dick bankers and pig fuckers on Wall Street choke on my testicles. I don't like to believe that people in this world are cartoonishly evil, but I know these knob-slobbering chodes have absolutely no problem demolishing the lives of millions just so they can get another yacht.

And I really hope this is it, I really hope this is the beginning of a takedown of these predatory miscreants. I pray that this isn't just some blip in history where a bunch of assholes on the internet made a mess of things. This will be a revolution in which the masses reap their rewards. Not from violence and riots, not from meaningless protests that make school kids think they're revolutionaries, not from the government making taxes and legislation, but from *SHEER. UNADULTERATED. AUTISM.* WE'LL TAKE BACK WHATS OURS BY TAKING THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE FREE MARKET, MAKING IT INTO A FIST, AND SHOVING UP THEIR ASS! SORRY MR.

we already know were retarded. so the whole make us feel bad for it has ZERO effect on a real autist. The only thing it did was confirm our biases. Did you *really* think the hedgies are just gonna roll over and lose millions? of course not. theyre gonna lie and scheme and do everything to protect their precious. Fucking Smeagols, thats what they are. By now everyone and his milf mother knows the media got the hedgies back, because they made it painfully obvious. Im almost a 100% sure that a couple of paperhanded pussies sold at like 60 and fomo's back in when it hit 90.

18,"Robinhood was downloaded 600,000 last Friday alone according the article below. I am estimating likely a total of 5 million new RH brokerage accounts were created in the last two weeks. The average account has a balance of between $1,000 to $5,000… I’m just going to pick the middle ground and say $3,000. That means over the last two weeks there is about $15 BILLION of buying power from this bunch.

Since Robinhood likely represents about 25% of the brokerage market, maybe another 15 million additional accounts have been opened across all the various Brokerage service providers. Possibly representing another $45 BILLION of buying power.

**In total we are looking at $60 BILLION in new buying power, while the market cap of GameStop is sitting at a relatively cheap $3.7 Billion, at the share price of only $53.**

That means all the new investors could easily **take GameStop to above $900 price per share** with that buying power. But only if everyone can **FOCUS ON GAMESTOP ONLY**.

The Shorts that didn’t cover, or new shorts that came in the game recently would be forced to push the price much higher to exit. Some **shorts may have to cover at prices well above $1,000+ per share** to get out under such a scenario.

Nobody acts this way if they had nothing to lose. This means that they may be as desperate enough to take the hit this week in order for you to sell and they can buy to cover next week. Yes. They’re that shorted.

This is bigger than us now. Yes. Some higher up WSB chads that are long players are gonna be millionaires. But this is about discovering if we have a free market or not. This will be a catalyst for something. I don’t know what. But something. THEY are actively suppressing trading in a free market because THEY risk losing.

Fucking HOLD ON 💎🙌🏽💎 Even if it dips to $10. They literally cannot buy enough stock without triggering a MASSIVE/INFINITE price fluctuation. They are that knee deep in shit.

If they halt trading, it’ll be scary but they literally cannot buy enough stock because WE’RE NOT SELLING 💎💎💎💎

If your hands start to get itchy because $1,000 seems very tempting for a volatile stock you paid $350< DON’T fucking worry. It’s just the pressure forming your DIAMOND HANDS 💎🙌🏽💎

They’re trying to exhaust you and manipulate you AND the markets. We have the upper hand but they’re the abusive person in our lives that have a psychological edge.

It was ultimately bad for me. But the one thing I gained from that place was this sense of giddiness and community with people I have never and will never meet. It was a weird special feeling I would get every once in a while.

I was a casual reddit user and it was all fine, but WSB and this GME shit has filled me with a specific sense of euphoria I havent felt in a very long time. Seeing millions of fucking idiots banding together (LEGALLY AND NOT COLLUDING) with their scraps of income to ultimately cause one of the biggest and unprecedented shifts in the market I have ever seen fills me with such a deep sense of community and joy.

51,"Let me explain something to those of you here that are still trying to figure out what is going on. Wall street is trying to break the rules because retail played fairly, and wall street lost. Is GME worth 200+ dollars? That's for you to decide based on your own value system. For me, there is a lot of value in knowing that having a few shares of this company is causing billionaires and hedge funds to suffer. These people that have juiced our economy for so long with their greed and corruption. 

So what are they doing? They are preventing people from trading while they trade as much as they want to generate price action to get people to panic. They are doubling down on their belief that we are unsophisticated. They are appealing to the SEC to regulate us because they are on the verge of losing an incredible amount of wealth. 

There is a very real chance that if you buy a share today you might lose all that you put into it. But let me ask you this: Is losing $200 worth making these people suffer for the blatant and obvious corrupt behavior they are showing us as I type this? If you can't afford to lose $200 you absolutely should not buy GME. Frankly, I am not a financial advisor of any sort, so if you listen to me you might be an idiot. I'm just another millenial that was raised believing the world was full of opportunity, but even with a degree and full time job in my field I spend 50% of my income on rent. ON RENT. I drive a piece of shit vehicle with 160000 miles on it. I sold 20 of my shares yesterday (don't worry I bought them back on the dip today) and I now have more disposable income that I have ever had in my entire life. 

These people would rather die than let you have any of their money. I am fully prepared to lose everything I have put into GME, and you know what? I will still have more disposable income than ever before because I flipped a quick trade on GME. I am lucky that I was using a broker that let me. If you are still on the fence of whether to buy...well, make your own decision. Do your own due diligence. However, this moment we are witnessing is going to be taught by shitty high school baseball coaches in econ class for decades to come. No matter what happens here, wall street is losing. 

Position: 45 shares. Ride or die bitches

Posting for visibility:

THIS IS THE HEDGE FUNDS PLAYBOOK ON HOW TO ATTACK US AND REDUCE THE PRICE

Abusive shorting are not random acts of a renegade hedge funds, but rather a coordinated business plan that is carried out by a collusive consortium of hedge funds and prime brokers, with help from their friends at the DTC and major clearinghouses. Potential target companies are identified, analyzed and prioritized. The attack is planned to its most minute detail.

The plan consists of taking a large short position, then crushing the stock price, and, if possible, putting the company into bankruptcy. Bankrupting the company is a short homerun because they never have to buy real shares to cover and they don't pay taxes on the ill-gotten gain.

When it is time to drive the stock price down, a blitzkrieg is unleashed against the company by a cabal of short hedge funds and prime brokers. The playbook is very similar from attack to attack, and the participating prime brokers and lead shorts are fairly consistent as well.

Typical tactics include the following:

Flooding the offer side of the board - Ultimately the price of a stock is found at the balance point where supply (offer) and demand (bid) for the shares find equilibrium. This equation happens every day for every stock traded. On days when more people want to buy than want to sell, the price goes up, and, conversely, when shares offered for sale exceed the demand, the price goes down.

The shorts manipulate the laws of supply and demand by flooding the offer side with counterfeit shares. They will do what has been called a short down ladder. It works as follows: Short A will sell a counterfeit share at $10. Short B will purchase that counterfeit share covering a previously open position. Short B will then offer a short (counterfeit) share at $9. Short A will hit that offer, or short B will come down and hit Short A's $9 bid. Short A buys the share for $9, covering his open $10 short and booking a $1 profit.

By repeating this process the shorts can put the stock price in a downward spiral. If there happens to be significant long buying, then the shorts draw from their reserve of ""strategic fails-to-deliver"" and flood the market with an avalanche of counterfeit shares that overwhelm the buy side demand. Attack days routinely see eighty percent or more of the shares offered for sale as counterfeit. Company news days are frequently attack days since the news will ""mask"" the extraordinary high volume. It doesn't matter whether it is good news or bad news.


Flooding the market with shares requires foot soldiers to swamp the market with counterfeit shares. An off-shore hedge fund devised a remarkably effective incentive program to motivate the traders at certain broker dealers. Each trader was given a debit card to a bank account that only he could access. The trader's performance was tallied, and, based upon the number of shares moved and the other ""success"" parameters; the hedge fund would wire money into the bank account daily. At the end of each day, the traders went to an ATM and drew out their bribe. Instant gratification.

Global Links Corporation is an example of how wholesale counterfeiting of shares will decimate a company's stock price. Global Links is a company that provides computer services to the real estate industry. By early 2005, their stock price had dropped to a fraction of a cent. At that point, an investor, Robert Simpson, purchased 100%+ of Global Links' 1,158,064 issued and outstanding shares. He immediately took delivery of his shares and filed the appropriate forms with the SEC, disclosing he owned all of the company's stock. His total investment was $5205. The share price was $.00434. The day after he acquired all of the company's shares, the volume on the over-the-counter market was 37 million shares. The following day saw 22 million shares change hands - all without Simpson trading a single share. It is possible that the SEC has been conducting a secret investigation, but that would be difficult without the company's involvement. It is more likely the SEC has not done anything about this fraud.

Massive counterfeiting can drive the stock price down in a matter of hours on extremely high volume. This is called ""crashing"" the stock and a successful ""crash"" is a one-day drop of twenty-percent or a thirty-five percent drop in a week. In order to make the crash ""stick"" or make it more effective, it is done concurrently with all or most of the following:

Media Assault -

The shorts, in order to realize their profit, must ultimately put the victim into bankruptcy or obtain shares at a price much cheaper than what they shorted at. These shares come from the investing public who panics and sells into the manipulation. Panic is induced with assistance from the financial media.

The shorts have ""friendly"" reporters with the Dow Jones News Agency, the Wall Street Journal, Barrons, the New York Times, Gannett Publications (USA Today and the Arizona Republic), CNBC and others. The common thread: A number of the ""friendly"" reporters worked for The Street.com, an Internet advisory service that short hedge-fund managers David Rocker and Jim Cramer owned. This alumni association supported the short attack by producing slanted, libelous, innuendo laden stories that disparaged the company, as it was being crashed.


One of the more outrageous stories was a front-page story in USA Today during a short crash of TASER's stock price in June 2005. The story was almost a full page and the reporter concluded that TASER's electrical jolt was the same as an electric chair - proof positive that TASERs did indeed kill innocent people. To reach that conclusion the reporter over estimated the TASER's amperage by a factor of one million times. This ""mistake"" was made despite a detailed technical briefing by TASER to seven USA Today editors two weeks prior to the story. The explanation ""Due to a mathematical error"" appeared three days later - after the damage was done to the stock price.

Jim Cramer, in a video-taped interview with The Street.com, best described the media function:

When (shorting) ... The hedge fund mode is to not do anything remotely truthful, because the truth is so against your view, (so the hedge funds) create a new 'truth' that is development of the fiction... you hit the brokerage houses with a series of orders (a short down ladder that pushes the price down), then we go to the press. You have a vicious cycle down - it's a pretty good game.

This interview, which is more like a confession, was never supposed to get on the air; however, it somehow ended up on YouTube. Cramer and The Street.com have made repeated efforts, with some success, to get it taken off of YouTube."

You don't want to shut down a hedge fund in exchange of some new PDT bullshit.  
In such scenario you literally took a fishing rod, got a fish with it and then throwed fishing rod away to the ocean calling it a victory. That is retarded.  
What IMO should be mentioned here AND I DONT FUCKING SEE IT BEING MENTIONED BY ANYONE ON MAIN WALL is that more valuable is taking down already existing PDT and increase transparency in what hedgefunds are doing (their positions etc.) as they are doing some big ass leverages and stock raids (like overshorted GME).

126,"To be honest I've been saying stuff like this for years and it felt like no one listened.

I remember leaving school with no prospects. Picking up work where I could. Being angry at the system because big money got bailed out while I fell in with the 'wrong' crowd (absolute bros who know what a hard life is like tbh but thats another story) got kinda deep into drugs (and shoplifting to pay for it)

At some point I got sick of it and scored myself a job in sales. It sucked the Life out of me but I was pretty good at it. So my shitty sales job got me a slightly better sales job and keeping my head down got me a really good sales job at a really big company. I was there for about 8 months before I realised I couldnt do it anymore.

But through this experience I became a supporter of capitalism. That individual people have the power to put themselves in a better position more than any charity or group or government could so I gave up my nice cosy salary and indebted myself to start a degree (I should graduate in a few months with a degree in compsci) 

I'm still not in a great position financially in fact I'm broke as shit and wish i had some skin in this game. But I've learned and grown and gained some valuable new skills i can hopefully go and make a decent living from with enough to go and make these types of bets and take an ownership stake in the companies that make our economy tick over. 

I'm so proud of you guys cause you're giving me hope that I was right, that we can take things over and start running things ourselves and that maybe... just maybe... with all these tendies you shitheads make you might actually start to stimulate some real sustainable growth both by taking some for yourselves and splashing some cash, by taking improved stakes in other companies and by creating new seed capital for start ups.

130,"Fair warning: my wife was being *severely* underpaid for her sector and expertise, and after repeatedly making a well-documented case for why she should get a healthy raise, she was basically pushed out of her old position. They knew how valuable she was—she was ten times more productive and five times better than the next best person they had—but something about either the management or the payroll/finance/HR just refused to compensate her appropriately.

ON THE OTHER HAND, she immediately got a job at twice the salary, twice the bonus, much more recognition, and a company culture she likes infinitely better.

Your mileage may vary. Being insistent is kind of a crap shoot, so hope for the best, but do be prepared for the worst."
131,"Did you stop paying attention after I mentioned his money? Let’s recap. 

“Brilliant mind” means he is developing modern rocket ships to make humanity space-faring once again (with an aim toward one day getting people off this doomed planet and potentially saving the human race), where our own governments have all but given up on space programs. 

“Beautiful mind” means developing and selling electric, low-energy cars to help delay the effects of global warming. 

“Embracing modern technology” means he is working with cutting edge engineers to design life-changing technology which could help a paralyzed person walk again, or help a deaf person communicate. 

Embracing modern technology also means he has embraced, yes, cryptocurrency, albeit in his own way. Now sadly he hasn’t gone all-in and made himself a total shill for the industry as you probably had hoped, but at the very least he and his company are actively engaged with crypto projects and even accepting some as forms of payment for his projects. 

And oh ya. He does all this ON HIS OWN DIME, putting his own money on the line, which he has a lot of, because he is one of the richest people in the world.

176,"💎THEY TRIPLED DOWN ON AMC SHORTING 💎 

Why the AMC squeeze hasn't happened yet: 

Take a look at this link ( https://iborrowdesk.com/report/AMC )and scroll down to recent data for AMC. Borrowing fees (meaning the rate at which the hedge funds have to pay to short the stock) have risen from 3.2% to 21.9% in the past day. This is a dramatic increase. However, that's only the beginning. This is GME's borrowing rates and available shares to short: https://iborrowdesk.com/report/gme

If you look at GME's borrowing rates, the last time they were at 22% was 1/21/21 (6 days ago). 5 days later, the borrowing rates SPIKED up to 83%. This was also the same day the GME squeeze went crazy from 90 -> 300. As Martin Shkreli said, keep your eye on the borrowing rates, not the short interest. The borrowing rates make the hedge funds nervous and is ultimately a huge factor for them having to cover. Covering leads to squeezing. I predict a similar, though not as significant squeeze as GME for AMC. This is something to keep an eye on.

Shares available to short for AMC has also decreased from 10,000,000 6 days ago on 1/21 to <200,000 as of close, meaning the hedge funds are getting greedy as fuck trying to make us lose!!!

Additionally AMC is better off than it was during the pandemic. Their bankruptcy concerns are completely off the table with a billion in funding. They are also a very low market cap at 4B, meaning there is much bigger potential for their price to increase. Movies are not fucking dead, mark my words. AMC is due for a HUGE rally. There's room for both squeezes, lets fucking go boys.

Everyone here should put $1 each and we should create a people’s brokerage...like a WSB type thing but for buying and selling shares and options and it should be owned by the people and STRICT UNCHANGEABLE founding principles that would never allow anything like this to happen.
And as for the crook fucks in the white house that let this happen, we should have DIRECT DEMOCRACY, where the people vote directly! We don’t need any sharks running us...the people can decide their own future by themselves"
178,"# EXERCISE YOUR CALLS ON FRIDAY

As everyone knows, people don't generally exercise options because it makes more sense to sell it back at a profit.

However, remember that selling your $GME calls back to the market maker relieves short squeeze pressure, because they then don't have to source 100 shares to sell to you.

If the goal is to keep up the pressure on the short squeeze, the rational play is therefore to exercise your call options.

In fact, it even makes sense at this point to exercise OTM calls on Friday, if you think that the stock will go back up before Monday's open.

If you don't have the cash to exercise all of them, but have a few options, you might be able to sell some to exercise the rest.

Edit: I don't know what the fuck I am talking about. This is not investment advice. Slippery when wet (your mom). Seriously, think it through, then come to your own conclusion."

184," FINRA is the official government agency on this matter too. 30% SI is huge, 78% is astro-fucking-nomical. When 140% of the stock was shorted the shorts were betting for $20 and below. It jumped from $35-$400 in 7 days. People with $20 puts were at a 2:1 loss before they even knew what was happening; 10:1 a day after that.

Buying was shut off with most brokers because those HFs literally couldn't cover their margin calls, which made clearing houses liable; they didn't have the liquidity either; so it fell on the DTC. DTC didn't even have the liquidity, so they pawned it off as collateral on brokers and forced trading to get shut down. Everything was so underwater the entire stock market almost collapsed. Not crashed; collapsed. HF's haven't covered because they literally can't. They used money they didn't even have to open those positions in the first place (leverage), and now their brokers (institutional banks) are on the hook.

As soon as this starts going back up the rest of the lower shorts are going to get covered. Those liable were just waiting for it to bottom out. And when it really starts climbing all those people that shorted at 400 or 300 or 200 are going to start covering to lock in profits. THE SQUEEZE IS STILL ON!!"

186,ONE EIGHT SEVEN ON A MOTHERFUCKIN (GAME)STOP
187,"# In case you're not understanding yet what is going on and how they drop the price

1. There are two markets. The actual market and the shadow market (called Over The Counter OTC which is a market between marketmakers and hedgefunds)
2. Shitadel (allegedly) is dumping shares on the real market for a price lower than current.
3. One of their crony hedgefund friends is buying them at that lower price
4. This makes the price go down, especially since we are all holding and almost NOONE is trading, the effect of this is pretty massive.
5. Ok so they traded and made the price go down. Now they're out of shares right?NO. They're using the OTC market to give back the shares, and then repeat the same process continously to drop the price without end.

# Why are they doing this

To make you scared, and to try and get you to sell. There are no other explanations. Well maybe to prevent being margin called. However, they're borrowing more and more shares to do this, so if you DONT SELL OR EVEN BETTER BUY MORE they're doing all this for nothing and they will be worse off than they started.

# Can I see proof of this?

Proof that there is major traffic in the OTC market for GME. 500 million plus shares in january!Thats 10x float. (No this does not mean short interest is 10x float)

If you want proof of the down trading then search for ""GME level 2 live"" on Youtube during trading hours. You will see in the bid AND ask column a suspicious number of listings for a weird number of shares. ""19"", ""26"" ""37"" ""51"". All weird numbers that they use to identify eachother. These get traded hundreds of times back and forth per hour by algorithms.

# THEY CAN CRASH IT TO $20 IF THEY WANT TO
And all you have to do to win is BUY but at minimum HOLD.

Everytime you sell (including daytrading, paperhanding or selling and buying back later on the dip for more shares) it RESETS the time to deliver and delays the squeeze.

HOLD ON TO YOUR SHARES AS IF THEYRE YOUR BABIES"

190,"here is a frequent scenario:   

--you're waiting in your car for the next ride request.  
sometimes as long as 10 or 20 minutes during a slower period (100% not paid by lyft)  

--you take the request and drive to the passenger pick up location, up to 15 mins away (also, 100% not paid)  

--the passenger is not ready, they take up to 5 mins to get into the car. (100% not paid, EVEN THOUGH LYFT CLAIMS YOU ARE PAID FOR WAIT TIME, YOU ARE NOT)

--its a short ride, it only takes 5 minutes to get to their destination.   

lyft pays the absolute minimum for this ride (in los angeles) its $2.36

**you just spent** 20+15+5+5 = **45 minutes and got paid $2.36**   

this is before expenses like gas, upkeep, or income tax as an ""independent contractor""   
you have no employee benefits like healthcare or 401k etc.    
no job security.  
no possibility of a raise.  
no possibility of advancement.  
no training for advancement.  

in addition to this, any time lyft claims there is ""surge pricing"" as a multiplier for how much you get paid.  
THEY JUST DONT PAY IT.  

when you look at the ride breakdown of how much you get paid versus how much lyft stole from you, you notice **LYFT TAKES UP TO 70% of the money**  
and they're not doing anything.  
you are the driver, you do 100% of the work.   

lyft takes its ""ride set up fee"" from every single ride, they got their cut, but NO, thats not enough.  
they take 30 to 70% of your ""PER MINUTE"" and ""PER MILE"" ON TOP of the ""ride set up fee""

its a scam. dont do it."

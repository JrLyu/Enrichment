1,"Note: If you're in GME, don't sell Friday unless the SHORT PERCENTAGE drops significantly below 100%. Do not sell based on a DATE. Sell based on the total SHORT PERCENTAGE of the stock. GME's short squeeze likely won't reach PEAK LEVELS until next week. HOLD PAST FRIDAY. Do not sell Friday just because it's Friday. Feel free to copy/paste this.

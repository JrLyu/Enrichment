1,"I tracked profiles commenting here for about 7 hours this morning mostly during PM. The amount of inorganic accounts spreading FUD on GME and hyping things that aren’t GME is an *alarming* ratio. There are some actual users here who have fallen for that shit and are toeing the same line, but they’re like 20-leaf clovers compared to the amount of astroturfing going on."

3,"> We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

Hey, I sent a PM about this, but I can probably help out with the ratelimit issue. Given the amount of traffic the subreddit has, the API limits can be somewhat worked around with some clever coding and I'd be willing to help write something.

PM me on Reddit (don't send me a Reddit Chat) or on Discord or on Twitter if you want to discuss stuff like that"

# I'm so fucking proud of you apes. And how they're going to try and break our subreddit during the weekend.

**Way to go, monke.**

Who would have thought we would close Friday with a volume less than [1/4 of last week's](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME)? (for us monke, this means everyone is  💎🙌 ).

Who    would have thought we'd get the stock over 320$ when they manipulated    by colluding, limiting our buying power artificially and laddering  the   price down to 170$ the day before?

Every    single day we  💎🙌 , they lose. They lose BIG, so big their wife's    boyfriends have kicked them out and sold their lambos. [A 70 BILLION loss](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-retail-trading-shortbets/losses-on-short-positions-in-u-s-firms-top-70-billion-ortex-data-idUSKBN29X1SW).

**Now, this is how they try and bend us over the weekend.**

They've    already lost, what do they have left? To minimize losses. We know all    the shit they tried already, so what's going to happen now? **They're doubling down on dilluting this community.**

Sorting    by new is an absolute disgrace by now and should just be ignored, but    some of the post even reach rising. Here's what I've found so far and    what even a monke with a smooth brain understands:

·They've covered their shorts: No. Fucking. Way. They were at [5.91b$ two days ago (139%)](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1354470406934167560). They were [11.2b$ (113%) yesterday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755). And the short volume ratio [has maintained the same the past two weeks](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme).    They're repositioning their shorts. The short interest ratio % will  be   reduced and the total ammount will continue to increase as we drive   the  stock price up.

·$BRUCE is the new $GME.

PART 1: I understand how you feel, you thought you diversified [and then you realized their charts are identical](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l82vi1/gme_with_amc_and_bb_overlay_virtually_identical/). Being smoothbrained does that to you, believe me I know. What does having two identical charts with different DDs mean? [I did some explaining in this reply](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l87d25/amc_short_squeeze_is_absolutely_possible_to_and/glbjsh0?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).    TL;DR: dilluting our funds is the worst fucking thing we can do right    now, especially when we have two (almost) identical stocks and GME  has a   way higher potential of short squeezeng to infinity (based on  the   ammount of short interest, float and the upwards movement caused  by   social media clout the past week).

PART  2: $FUCKU (who no one is talking about) is going the new $GME, guys,  *""listen up this is the most important DD you will ever read.""*.   Fuck off,  please. Same as above with less spice, tired of read   half-assed DDs in  the middle of the stock movement of the century.

·Fearmongering,   in general. I'm tired of these posts. You sound like your wife's    boyfriend left even her because the weakness of your  🧻  🙌 is   unbearable. I replied [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l88nzd/still_holding_but_sceptical_how_this_will_turn/glbicix?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)to some of your most worrisome nightmares but you can do a fucking    Google search before believing shit from randos on Twitter.

These   are just some examples I found floating around like turds on the pond   full of gold we're  drinking from right now. There will be more, so   please, LISTEN to my  TL;DR.

17,"Hey guys retard checking in here. 2020 and 2021 has been a rollercoaster for me. In 2020 I broke up with my 6 years long partner and that is infinitely worst than this. No money can cure the sadness that lasted a few months. I went down the rabbit hole of drinking for a few months and constantly woke up hangover.

Come 2021 my friend introduced me to wallstreetbets and i got so engrossed in stonks I stopped drinking so I can focus on it. It is a hobby now. 

I got 200 GME and seen it went to highs before falling to the lows yesterday. Feeling sad? You should be, it is a lot of money. But remember, it is not a lose or gain till you cash out. 

If a retarded loser like me can recover from binge drinking and diamond hands this shit? you can too. Feel free to PM if any of you are feeling down, there is no point beating yourself up over it. It is just physical materials. 

Go sleep 7 hours, drink water, hit the gym, or spend time with my ex. While i watch on the sidelines."

i want to climb into luigi's anus and pound his rectum from the inside. i then want to lick his asshole clean and proceed to hump his anal cavity, crawl out of his asshole, and blow luigi until his cum pour into my gaping mouth as i swallow it, licking my lips.

28,"Crying right now with you. I am jobless, broke, depressed and suicidal. The only thing that has kept me going are my kids and wife. I can’t imagine your pain. I am so sorry. You need anything or want to come over for Thanksgiving? We have three kids and a dog it’s wild here. If you’re ever feeling down or lonely PM me. Apes together strong. 

Like you, for the first time in a long time I have hope. My kids are going to have a better world I think because of this. I should post a video I am a mess and crying right now like a big baby. Fuck yes!!!!!!!! I love you, I love everyone reading this, except all the assholes we hate, you know who you are. 

I want to devote my life to this, I am willing to ride or die with any of you now. I haven’t cried happy tears in a while this is such an awesome day. This is for my kids.

Edit: just want to say I really appreciate the humanity and brother and sisterhood here. We all have so much in common and I love the light at the end of the tunnel we all see now. For those that have reached out, and concerned about me being suicidal, thank you. I would never go through with it, I could never abandon my wife and kids like that. It’s been rough on us all and to say it’s never crossed my mind would be a lie, but I would never go though with it. It’s the hardest way out. I like being lazy and taking the easy way out, like talking to someone."

It’s been a long time....to long. We should get together and have a couple drinks. I’ve got some great investment ideas that all involve you giving your money to me. After several months/years of telling you things are really going well and starting to take off, I’ll let you know that “we” lost the entire investment due to unforeseen circumstances that were impossible to predict. If you’re interested, PM me right away as I’m only going to let one of my good friends in on this deal."

34,"Things are about as good as we could ask for right now. The top of the mod team are all long term trusted members, I'm able to come back and resume my usual stuff, and we've got more newfriends than we know what to do with.

Not sure if it'll take an hour or a day or a week but I'm gonna do my best to get everything back to normal. [We're back](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lF7M0FISH5Y&t=13s).

**EDIT**: For what it's worth, the Reddit admins were cool when I talked to them. I didn't know what to expect, but they seem like they actually get us and want to let us continue to do our thing. I am not gonna blame them for needing some time to gather facts. If you could do me a favor, give them the benefit of the doubt. Let's try to move forward assuming everyone is on the same page and working toward the same goal, which is a wallstreetbets that continues to be as excellent as it always has been.

I can also tell you flat out that the conspiracy stuff I've been seeing about certain tickers and Reddit being compromised and whatnot is just people misinterpreting the actions of what to them is a black box. If you're worried about something that is going on, missing submissions from now -> whenever, etc, you're *always* welcome to PM me or message modmail and I will try to figure out what's up.

Let's leave all the political nonsense and drama in the dust and get back to being an equities dive bar with a few new members."

40,"GOOD MORNING EVERYONE!!! I wrote this in yesterday’s thread but wanted to share here: 

Their strategy is to let it climb a little in AH and even more in PM so when the bell opens people think they’re selling “high” and paper hands will be gone in the first 20 minutes. Trade sideways all day to piss off the people actually watching, and then rinse and repeat. They really do think you’re that stupid, it’s obvious to anyone who’s been watching the past few weeks, shit even the past few months.

This, is not, a stock. It’s not moving like a stock, it’s not trading like a stock, it’s not covered by the media like a stock, so stop talking about healthy pre market and “this looks bullish” because we have no idea what it looks like. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD, and wait till they bleed out. Their moves are simple and desperate, which means they’re running out of time. Every pass is a Hail Mary and we will intercept one of them and run it back to our end zone soon enough.

EDIT: I’m aware my account is new, I jumped on this in January with barely any knowledge (proof in comments) and really loved what you guys were doing so I’ve been buying and holding ever since. I have read a ton of DD and learned everything I could in the past couple months which still is nothing compared to some of you. I appreciate all the love and I think the best part of this group is you can be a true retard like me and in just a short time... well I’m still retarded, but I like the stock 😜"

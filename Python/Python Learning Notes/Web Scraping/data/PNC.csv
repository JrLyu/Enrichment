0,"PNC pulled the same shit with their ""Free Checking"". It's free if you have an auto-deposit of more than $500 a month. This sounds like an easy thing right? Well, if you get benefits from the government, they pay on the 1st of the month, *unless* that day is a non-banking day like a holiday or weekend. So the government will deposit the money *before* the first of the month meaning you won't have the qualifying deposit that month and PNC gets to charge you the $7 fee.

This policy is deliberately fucking people out of money who can least afford it with this sneaky bullshit. Fuck banks."
1,"I'm currently in the process of emptying my PNC accounts so I can close them. They told me they will send me a check, but not transfer the funds to another institution. Their suggestion was to transfer the funds myself manually in between statements so I don't incur low balance fees when the statement drops. "
2,I have both PNC and Huntington do either of them steal peoples money like this?
3,"I'm a little late to the party, but I feel that a lot of people forget about community banks and credit unions as viable alternatives to large banks (BofA, Wells, PNC,etc). Most community banks and CU's, at least in the Midwest where I am located, do offer free checking to compete with big banks and offer many of the same services as well. There are regulatory and governing bodies that provide deposit insurance, so your money is no less safe. These same agencies also restrict community banks and CU's from engaging in high-risk activities that have gotten big banks in trouble in the past, such as securitization, propitiatory trading and investment banking (think Lehman Bros and 2008). Local financial institutions are also the backbone of small businesses and local economic development. Depositing your money with them directly relates to their ability to lend to your community.

Long story short, you have plenty of options. "

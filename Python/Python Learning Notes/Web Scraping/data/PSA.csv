0,"PSA: You can still buy AMC on Cashapp

Hold and if you can BUY"
1,"/u/zjz  /u/only1parkjisung \- I hope you read this. I'm an engineer working with a lot of public entities/communications. I think the twitter should be strictly used for service announcements. Today is a great example: taking the sub private  (pre-emptively or in parallel) because of technical issues is key. Instead of bastards on twitter being allowed to go on for hours tweeting/retweeting wsb has been banned with no proof, easily spreading FUD. Try and get out ahead. Those couple hours of silence until the message popped up tanked the stock (not your fault). This is a great time for a PSA from the twitter. Simple, effective and shows mods are in control.

IMO you don't need to make any statements outside PSAs. It dilutes the messaging of the twitter. Statements should be few and far between but always impactful. No commentary on stocks, just the forum and ONLY when necessary. Most of the time a user will post the exact issue on the subreddit followed by discussion.

Twitter should be held in a sacred regard. Using it unabashedly will only make it weaker."
2,Where was this post last week? Only see rocket ships when the stock goes up. Then when it loses 75% we get PSA's
3,"Ok that makes sense, I'm just making sure.
PSA GME to the moon🚀🚀"
4,PSA - If a isp say they cant lower your bill over the phone. Take all their equipment to their location and cancel in person. Watch how fast your bill drops.
5,"LOL. I did this. Cox still tried to raise mine.

Fun fact/PSA for Cox customers: it is cheaper to make changes to Cox services online than in person. The same service that a store location rep tells you costs $100 is offered online for $50 with a two year pricelock guarantee. Never, ever deal with Cox in person or over the phone to order services unless you want to pay double."
6,"> complaint to BBB

PSA: The Better Business Bureau is a bunch of scammers and extortionists. They give your business an A+ rating if you pay the membership fee, no questions asked. And not paying your protection money means they'll give you a lower score and won't investigate false complaints.

They profit from consumers who think the BBB is a government agency (they're not) and from scummy business owners who want a good rating without having to actually earn it.

My advice? Go to your local chamber of commerce and file a complaint. They'll actually do something.

7,"Wow this makes me so happy to hear that they're sending people to prison for this.

Edit: PSA/reminder, the IRS won't call you.  They'll send letters asking for info/clarification, not immediate payment."
8,"**PSA**

Those of us who are investors in GME aren't making comments like,  "" Look how much it dropped its so unfair""

 **The real investors,**  remember the previous GME squeeze and we know what happened was a desperate attempt by shorts to flood the market with short shares to drop the price.  This is actually, a good sign.  We have all seen this before. On January 27th.  

  If you are reading this,  trust in us Apes who lived through the first squeeze and seen the 8-9 circuit breaker halts in a day combined with sudden massive volume increases as the price dropped.   This is new short positions being opened.  If you want to profit, and win.

 Do one of these things or both.

1. Do not sell.
2. Buy

This is not investment advice.  See you at 280$ by close."
9,"PSA: Unless you're dying from lack of sodium, you don't need to add salt to this particular recipe since both the soup mix and the broth have high sodium contents. If you are, like me, in love with soup and crock pots and consider taking three already prepared foods and heating them up ""cooking"" then consider low sodium broth, a container of pre-diced onions, and low sodium Worcestershire sauce. The first two are super easy to find but the last one not so much but google has it.

edit: wrong word"
10,PSA: Never go into business for yourself as a website designer. It is the seventh circle of hell.
11,"Reddit absolutely fucking ruins every sub that gets big. People here used to write fan mail to Martin Shkreli and now people are posting this butt fuck r worded redditor shit ""PSA you're not allowed to like this person."""
12,"PSA: FOR ANYONE WHO CANNOT BUY GME STOCK BECAUSE TRADING 212 HAS STOPPED ALLOWING BUY ORDERS

It is absolutely disgraceful and reprehensible that Trading 212 is not allowing people to buy shares in GME. This is market manipulation to the core. Thankfully, there are a couple of ways around it.

1. Currently, it is possible to purchase GME shares on Trading 212 via the German market, instead of the NYSE. If you search 'GS2C' in the T212 search bar you will find GME under the DE and will be able to purchase shares. However, it is possible that T212 will catch on and limit people buying shares on this market as well. This takes me to the next solution.
2. Download a different broker app - FreeTrade allows one to make an account incredibly quickly and easily. You will need a pro account to make trades, which costs 9.99 a month, however you will make plenty more from trading GME stock. Furthermore, you will not be charged until February 3rd anyway so you can still opt out by that time.

Today I was trying to make new accounts in various apps and FreeTrade gave me the least hassle - I didn't have to go through leaps and bounds to make an account. I am in no way affiliated to FreeTrade it is just what I found best when trying to buy more GME stock today.

This is not financial advice.

Obligatory **🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀**"
13,"#PSA: Check loss porn for possible shills.

When looking at loss porn, check for which stock or product it was, whether they went long or short and if the numbers seem off or fishy.

Also, be vigilant of photoshop indicators, such as edges, shapes and pattern changes in and around the artifacts of compression and anti aliasing.

Don’t let insufficient or disputable information affect your emotions and trigger decisions you might regret.
Think of it as a big ass game of Among Us, with over 7M players. And most importantly, think for yourself.

14,"PSA: please make a copy and close the public sheet. 

Google has a limit on number of users accessing a sheet and won't let new users connect once reached.

Also thanks op for this, I'm excited to use it!"
15,"I thought everyone knew wsb is for YOLO plays and that this is a casino?

Either gain porn or loss porn and nothing in between.

But seriously, thanks for the PSA, I definitely fomo the people making massive gains on options plays but I don't have the stomach for it. Congrats to those people and fuck'em as well 😂"
16,"If you want a reason to hold then think about the fact that this year is Pokémon’s 25th anniversary and GameStop deals a fuck ton of Pokémon cards. What happens to Pokémon cards when you hold them for years? 

I bought a PSA 9 Japanese Lugia neo genesis August 2019 for $33. They sell for a little over $500 now. GameStop is in a transitional era and the announcement of a new CFO soon could be huge and make the stock jump even more. 

“If the reason you bought into the company hasn’t changed then why would you sell?”

17,I'm not sure if making a PSA about this will help anyone at all. If this isn't something you already know idk what to say then. Sounds like this lady will be getting hit with the Stupid Tax soon.
18,"Yeah, it's very circlejerky in here.  This should really be more of a ""PSA: don't forget to regularly check the terms and conditions you agreed to for your bank accounts to avoid fees,"" instead it's a slanted hate-train towards BofA.  They're not doing anything wrong or exploitative if you agreed to it when you signed on the dotted line."
19,Good PSA - hope you get all back.  I hate this shady type of commerce.
20,"You voluntarily opted in for this insurance. It isn’t a scam, because you agreed to the terms. You may not remember because you’re careless, but you opted in.

This is a PSA to actually know what you’re doing and investigate all statements for charges you didn’t make, not a valid product that synchrony offers its customers."

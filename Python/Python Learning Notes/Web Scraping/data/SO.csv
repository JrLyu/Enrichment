2,"Hi! I’m a journalist - and this is 100% correct. Outlets have gotten better at avoiding this in politics, thanks to the last five years. But it’s still a big issue on other beats.

Now that newsrooms have shrunk, beat reporters usually handle the features and longer stories on their beat. Very few outlets still have breaking news reporters specifically dedicated to a beat.

That means shorter breaking-news style articles are usually written by early-career news general assignment reporters on insanely short deadlines, which usually aggregate the other news. All it takes is a few reputable folks saying misinformation, and boom, it’s getting propagated by hundreds of people without the knowledge or ability or time to fact check.

The only thing I’d push back on is calling it “lazy.” Lazy implies you have the option of doing better. With newsrooms so short staffed, none of us are lazy. We burn out SO fast. Newsrooms are broke, cheap, and value quantity over than quality (not always, but often) and because newsrooms are broke, reporters are overworked and under-resourced.

Not that there aren’t lazy reporters out there. But true laziness is reserved for the 70-year-old-Big-Names who really need to retire, but like having something to corner younger reporters with at cocktail parties.

PS: if you don’t like quantity-over-quality news, consider becoming a member of your local public media companies/member stations. I am very very lucky to have escaped commercial news. Public media is a land of no quotas and time.

Anyway. Just bought 4 more gme at 91."
3,"I’m a silent browser on reddit but the news turned me to this sub. The ‘08 recession collapsed my family (6 boys, parents with no college and new credit) so far into poverty that my parents will never climb out. Banks don’t touch them with a ten foot pole, they hit rock bottom and that’s how I grew up. I’m doing great after climbing out of the lower class but my younger brothers still have a mountain climb to get out of that dark shadow. YOU PEOPLE ARE BEAUTIFUL; FUCK THESE BASTARDS.

Edit for anyone who cares; I grew up sleeping on the floor of my grandmothers house in a bedroom with all my brothers. Fucking poor.

Once retail traders (You) are able to get back in at market open tomorrow, this will again go up. This is an attempt to scare ppl away from the stock.

11,"I didn’t buy to make a bunch of cash money, (of course I’d rather not lose it either), but I wanted in on this historic movement.  Win or lose, I wanted to say that I BOUGHT IN AND HELD!! I have been a Redditor for 8-9 years (I tend to change my name every once in a while), and I’ve joined and quit WSB because I didn’t understand if it was all a joke or what exactly this place was.  

I want to say thank you all so much, I am having such a blast! You guys are not a joke. And I have learned SO MUCH. I have wanted to get into investing since I was in my 30s, but always felt I couldn’t because I was a single mom (yadda yadda).  Now I’m 55 and doing okay, happily married, and we are alright.  

When this GME thing came up and I started researching it and understanding what it meant to so many people, and understanding Hedge Funds... we bought in. I’m so glad we did! Thank you to everyone on this sub, this is so fun, and (most) everyone has been so tolerant of the influx.  I’ve seen it described by some as a GME Cult, but this place feels much more exciting to me.  Holding and hoping everyone goes to the moon! And if not, enjoy this moment!

TLDR 💎✋"
12,"I think we all need to realize its very possible GME stocks can drop to as low as CENTS even ($0. 69/$0.420) . BUT THIS IS ALL ARTIFICIAL, driven down through market manipulation by the hedge funds & market makers. Don't panic and hold the fucking line!! LOSSES only materialize when you SELL.

It could take days or even weeks for the squeeze to start, but it will go down over DAYS not MINUTES. SO HOLD! 

If EVERYONE holds, we will turn our stocks into literal blank cheques when it's time for the hedge funds to cash out."

I know my company is going through struggles without me, trying to bring my replacement to speed. My boss was the one who gave me everything I had and learned. I felt guilty for SO LONG.

SO many message coming in:

1. Where to buy: I don't know, read other posts, schwab?TDA? I have no knowledge.
2. When to buy?when is the dip? THIS IS THE DIP MORONS, it's -28% HOW IS IT NOT THE DIP? BUY NOW!
3. When to sell? When you see the price going up very crazy like 5x 10x and you see the insane volume being traded. That's when the shorts are covering. might be tomorrow, might be next week. just buy and hold!

mods keep deleting my post!! PIN THIS PLEASE

**What is happening today: Short Ladder Attack, Market Manipulation, Strategy for today and tomorrow, how to not be silenced! 💎🙌🚀🚀🚀**

My fellow soldiers, I am utterly disgusted by what I am seeing today. I need to write something to get it all out and calm your paper hands.

**What happened**

1. Robinhood, webull, multiple other platforms banned buying shares of our favorite stocks, and a bunch of our stocks. This is clear and definitely market manipulation. They only allow people to sell. Please join the other threads to start a class action and file reports to the SEC! Citadel, Melvin, Point72, Robinhood, Webull, TD Ameritrade, they're all in bed together! They don't want retail investors like us to win and grab their yacht! THIS IS NOT PROHIBITION ERA!
2. Volume is insanely low, retail traders are sidelined, only hedge funds and institutions are trading. What does this mean? hedge funds are able to set the price since they're the only ones trading!
3. Short ladder attack. What is this? This is when hedge funds sell their shares repeatedly from hedge fund A to B to trigger the algo thinking there's a massive sell off. Nobody is actually selling the shares! I saw it over the drop from 450 to 230, there is only 3M volume, it's impossible to do so with a free market. What is this meant to do? Rattle retail investors like us, when we see the price dropping like crazy to sell off at whatever price it's at. Guess what? It didn't work! It dropped all the way until 155 and suddenly bounced back to 240 in a second. **You will see this all day and it does not mean anything!!!!**
4. Why today out of all days? The price went out of control up to 450, if it goes into tomorrow at that price, the gamma squeeze would be insane and it would send us to alpha centauri and beyond!**🚀** **🚀🚀🚀** Triggering the MOASS as well. By lowering the price coming in tomorrow, they can close their positions with lower losses, dampening the squeeze. Proof: [https://imgur.com/BFePDmn](https://imgur.com/BFePDmn) Look at the volume, the ask order book is empty and they drove the price down crazily. Same scenario on all the downward halts.

**Strategy for today and tomorrow**

1. File all the complaints, tweet at whoever will listen (papa elon, king chamath, ryan cohen, list goes on). DO NOT BE SILENCED! bring this to attention of everybody.
2. Gamma squeeze, with the current prices, gamma squeeze is almost but guaranteed, open interest on this is insane and friday morning the MM will start buying all the shares to hedge their positions. Last chance to strap into this rocket!
3. Do not sell! Find platforms that allow you to buy and BUY THE DIP. Why buy more you ask when the price is dropping? Because you are taking all their ammo!!! Look at this comparison the 2008 VW Squeeze. They want to dampen the squeeze. [https://imgur.com/9POlMcw](https://imgur.com/9POlMcw)

We are here, same strategy they employed back then. Didn't work then, will not work today.

THE ROCKET IS REFUELING BACK AT THE BASE, THIS IS IT, WE HAVE THEM BY THE ROPES!

BUY BUY BUY THE DIPPPP, LIFT OFF IS TOMORROW! GAMMA SQUEEZE IS ALMOST ALL BUT GUARANTEED!!!! CHARGE!!!!

32,"People need to understand WHY they are doing this.

They not only want to scare you and push you to sell, they NEED the price under a certain margin, because otherwise tomorrow they would have to buy SO MANY FUCKING SHARES (expiring calls ITM) that only the gamma squeeze would take us to the fucking outer space (5/10k easy)

They closed out of this trade 90% of the target and started to trade with each other, artificially bringing the price down to make the past calls expire OTM

So yes, they are saving their asses like this.
Yes, they still have to cover a shitton of shorts (but ya know, it’s easier to cover @200 than @2000) 

They literally killed robinhood in order to AVOID this monster gamma+short squeeze, IMAGINE HOW SCARED THEY ARE.

They threw a multi millionaire company under the bus just to save their asses, that’s how big this is.

NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE, YOU SHOULD DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH, I EAT CRAYONS"
33,"FR! Like WTF..I’m just over here having lost LITERALLY hundreds of thousands....I lost $100k when I cashed out all my money to buy in and I lost $200k more because RH tanked the entire thing and left most of us in ruins. So feel free to give back right over here since you’re holding a bag of cash smh. 

SIDE NOTE: I SURE HOPE EVERY DAMN SOUL ON HERE CLOSES THEIR RH ACCOUNT AND STICK IT TO THE REAL DIRTBAGS; THE SHRIFF OF NOTTINGHAM!! CUZ I CAN PROMISE YOU ANDREW LEFT WHO CAME TO OUR DEFENSE AFTER HE LOST IS NOT THE ENEMY IT’S THAT SHIT PILE MFR VLAD AND ROBINHOOD WHO RUINED US. 

FRANKLY IM KINDA SHOCKED THAT WE AREN’T RAGING AT THAT ASSHOLE: WE HIT $500!! THEN IT WAS ALL DESTROYED BY THAT SCUMBAG ON OUR WAY TO $1000!

37,Why is your underwear drawer disorganized? BECAUSE THE FEC SAID SO!
38,"I was thinking doing that. 

What sucks is that the handyman who signed the apartment to us and said to add a car whenever, came by the office and my SO pointed him out to the new manager and the handyman was how you doing? Etc.. but the manager said unless we can find proof they let us have it, the owner wants to charge us because she’s tried everything she’s can to convince him.

Literally all I can say is, according to the handyman, followed up by 2 other folks and a vague email I sent to them 2 years ago talking about moving my old car is all I have. I don’t have the money if the owner decided to tow the car.

When does this madness stop?

54,I feel so bullish if I had like 100 grand I’d yolo it. The fact they invested SO MUCH MONEY on the short attacks only proves they are trying to protect so many other shorts. We have to unlock them like in a video game
55,"Sorry guys, i panicked. SO I BOUGHT MORE.

[https://imgur.com/a/Duo4wTR](https://imgur.com/a/Duo4wTR)

but IBKR didn't let me buy at 190 for some reason :(. I ended up buying around 260. Fuck it, better than at what I trimmed all day."
56,Somebody please....FIND JA RULE SO I CAN MAKE SENSE OF ALL THIS
57,"compare a current 1 month chart in GME to the short squeeze in VW back in 2008. You would quickly realize that the real squeeze has not squoze. This is a dip that the hedge funds are orchestrating. You were encouraging paper hands in the final hour before the frenzy of buying that is the short bets trying to cover. SHORT INTEREST STILL 120%, THEY WANT TO BUY LOW SO THEY ARE TRYING TO MANIPULATE THIS AND YOU"
58,Thank you bro! It’s changed SO MUCH in two damn days! It’s becoming another echo chamber. That’s why a lot of people came here. To get away from that crap.
59,For real! Carrots are SO good when they're slow cooked. Or if you wanna get fancy buy a pressure cooker. What normally takes 8 hours takes 35 minutes.
60,"I agree with this. My SO can cook an entire roast with some veggies and such in 45 minutes and it falls apart with a fork. A roast will last us days too. Though, she has to get a new one and there are slow-cooker/pressure cooker combos for ≈50ish on Amazon.

Only bad thing is you kinda have a bomb in the kitchen when one doesn't know what they're doing, hence why she uses it. And I cook pancakes. "
61,"It's the convenience of ""set it and forget it"". You can dump ingredients in the crock, turn it on, leave to go to work, and come home to dinner being ready. 

A lot of people who use crockpots do so because they don't want to come home and cook after a long day. A pressure cooker can be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing; a Dutch oven is great if you're home all day. 

I enjoy cooking and I work from home. I still find it more convenient to take 2 minutes and toss some chicken breasts and marinade in the slow cooker and leave it until after work. If my SO comes home and is hungry, he can shred up the chicken and make himself tacos for dinner while I'm on conference calls. "
62,As a mother I am very disappointed in the slurs I see flying around this sub. You know better. <mom-eye>   That said -  I am SO FUCKING PROUD of all you and your diamond hands!!! Everyone gets ice cream for dinner! Gold star.  Just bought three more shares.
63,"1) I'm amazed by all the comments assuming clear legal right / wrong as the only consideration for u/DFV, and not narrative that can be spun to score points
2) I'm discouraged that nobody seems to think some elected officials might consider scoring points with 8 million + of the 99% instead of the 1% if they have enough reason.

SO GIVE THEM A DAMN REASON TO CHOOSE DFV OVER WALL STREET!!!! 

You amazing autists plastered the world with WSB billboards and owned global attention for a week and counting. And now you're fuckin giving up on DFV the guy who offered this freely to every single damn person who was stupid enough to listen??!!

As a dad, as a guy turning 59 this week, as a guy with a teen son, You make me SO DAMN PROUD that you honored your Dad by sharing him with us.  We know this now ---and a little bit of him will live on.  I want to be a cool dad too.

I'm sorry for your loss."
70,"Was the coolest part about my dad. I was going through my voicemails a couple days ago and had like 6-7 from my dad over the course of the past few months. My VM goes something like ""Hello, you have reached the cell phone of \_\_\_\_\_\_\_ \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_, IT Enthusiast, and systems engineer. I cannot get to the phone right now, but please leave me a brief message with your name, number, and reason for calling and I will get back to you as soon as possible."" , I could hear my dad talking to someone else for a brief second as he said ""How many 27 year olds do you know that have voicemails like that?"" and then cut out. 

&#x200B;

My dad really didn't know anything about IT or even how to use a computer. Didn't even have an email address. Yet was SO proud of the life I have built from it. He bought a family computer when I was like 11 and it blossomed into a full fledged career. Something I think he never fully understood but was proud of nonetheless."

My SO has forbidden me from a genius prime day idea.  I did not disagree. "
78,It's like what happened to me after I decided to cancel Prime. I saved SO MUCH MONEY!  I stopped buying every frivolous thing I saw because of the free 2-day shipping.
79,I had to teach my SO that a BOGOF offer is not a deal if you use it to get a second item that you weren't going to buy in the first place. Convinced them to just get two of the same item as it was a non-perishable consumable item they would use up. 
80,"I've used my firestick less and less over the year and a half or so I've owned it. I used it a bit the first month (same with my fire HD8 tablet), but since then, I stopped using the stick a LOT, and the tablet... I still use every now and again. It keeps me reading [something].

But the stick, since then has become for whatever reason SO bloated by Amazons own updates that it doesn't want to respond at times, and not function like the simple thing it is.

I PRIMARILY stopped using it, because Google and Amazon starting this year decided to not get along, and I can't watch Youtube on my TV anymore, so I straight up unplugged the device, and have only used it once this year.

I'm likely dropping Prime as well next year due to huge increases, and I've only watched one movie, and the savings on products.... isn't covering the costs of keeping prime.

If you plan on watching youtube with it; know you cannot watch youtube with a Firestick.

There are far better products out there that offer the same thing, and an Xbox is a great place to start because you already have it, and it probably isn't going to run as slow as a firestick will."

don't get fooled by propaganda like some suspensions, trading stop from the SEC, White House, feds or dunno what. we are talking here about a market cut around 25-60n$ on gme. amazon, apple, microsoft, the play around 1trillion$. this is peanuts for the market.

SO BUY IF YOU STILL CAN AND HOLD YOUR POSITIONS. don't give them any chance to cover their position for lower then 4269$. not only for your profit in $ but to show the world that an idea of making profit on betting against businesses, against dreams and lifes of individuals is not and should not be acceptable. we are writing history, everyone of us makes a difference.

Assume you will lose all your money, are you going to be okay if that happens?  10K to one person might be fine to loose but 10K to another might be their entire life savings.  If you lose everything, you also can't invest or gamble anymore, why would anyone ever go all in?!?!  Also, to the people going into debt, that is SO fucking dumb.

128,WHERE ARE ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHO WERE SO WORRIED ABOUT MY MONEY YESTERDAY?!
129,">It's really easy to look at actively managed funds in 2008, and see how bad of a wash they took.


Worked for a mutual fund manager in 2008, can confirm that we absolutely lost our shirts. 

There was one particularly bad day where the day's price drop on multiple funds was SO big that the system refused to accept the price as ""correct"". The system was programmed to reject anything greater than a 10% change because ""it'll never drop by that much in ONE day!"". Well, it did. And we had to call the IT guy back to the office (we were pricing after hours) to remove the 10% restriction so we could actually price the funds.

Not gonna lie, those were pretty scary times. 

"
130,"Yup, I was doing great and then I had to have surgery ($800 gone) and then my SO needed surgery (bye another $2k) and then a relatively new tire blew out so we had to get those all replaced. The fund is definitely not growing but at least it is staying steady. "
131,Some people may not have a discretionary/fun section in their budget. They may be putting all their money in to bills and debt with some savings. If you haven’t had a night out with SO/friends in a couple months use some $$$ that would be going to emergency funds for a nice night. You may need it later but you will drain yourself without some rewarding of yourself. 
132,"When looking at my SO's friends new houses, I was astonished at all the nice shit they had in their kitchen. She explained to me ""yeah, when you get married people give you stuff...""

Oh. Yeah that explained a lot. It might have been a subtle hint from her, but I like my Salvation Army pots and pans and utensils. "
133,"This is great advice and all, but my SO and I just bought our first house and went the complete opposite direction with furnishing. We bought good quality furniture (Pottery Barn, Crate and Barrel, Restoration Hardware, etc.) as well as brand new appliances right away. We had the cash on hand, but rather than spending it all, we opened up a new credit card with 0% financing for 15 months and put everything we bought on it. So not only did we not have to drop ~$14K at once, we gained ~$500 in rewards money from the credit card. Also, instead of slowly furnishing our home, we bought items that we loved, we won't pay a penny in interest, and we don't have to live in a barren home with empty rooms. We're pretty frugal overall so this might not work for everybody, but I'm very happy with our decision."
134,"For us furniture was a must once we bought the house - we had been living in a shitty apartments with furniture that was falling apart for a few years while we saved money. Once we had enough money for the down payment and closing expenses, we ended up waiting an extra year to buy the house to get enough money to buy the furniture. By then time we moved, our crappy old furniture didn't even make it to the curb without falling apart. We wore those suckers DOWN.
It was exciting to move into a house with brand new furniture, and to be totally debt free from it felt SO good."
135,"This is such a great thing for people to hear. My SO and I have always wanted this room or that room. For years we've only just bought pieces that we think would look great in ""that room"" that we love, which always changes. Years later we have such an awesome, unique, bunch of rooms that we could never have dreamt of. It's us and it's awesome, and it's so cool when people come over and say how great our place looks, I think if we had bought the ""room"" we wanted at the time, our place would look sterile and probably like a hotel room. "
136,"This is actually really good, practical advice. When my SO and I bought our house and moved in together we were constantly bummed out about how empty it always looked. Since we don't believe in using credit to live outside our means, it's taken us 5 years of collecting and decorating to actually get decorations, decent furniture, and generally make the house look like someone lived there. 

It doesn't happen overnight. 

"
137,"Absolutely correct. When I see myself trying to justify to myself why I need the power and features of the better tool, and how I'm going to justify it to my SO, I realize that I actually need the cheap one. I should not be a salesman to myself.

Then when it breaks and I need a better one, I tell myself ""I told me so!"" And get the better one lol.

But really the cheap harbor freight shit that I've bought that hasn't broken has saved me huge money. Even the good shit isn't that good anymore. My father has ran his own construction company and still has corded drills from the 80s that he rebuilds when they break. He spent hundreds on them back then. They are heavy, all metal, no plastic.

The first time I borrowed one from him, it fucked up my wrist, I was not expecting that torque. I was used to my weak walmart shit."
138,"I too just recently discovered consignment shops! I was able to get a small antique mahogany curio cabinet of sorts for $50 that is perfect for displaying my SO's tiki mug collection and some of my nicer plates and whatnots. It had been there at the shop for quite a while (and the shop owner was eager to get rid of it). The mahogany veneer in some spots needs to be replaced and fixed, but for now it's perfect and a great piece we'll be holding onto for a long time."
139,"Right there with you. I received my BS from the Arts Institute... originally a 40K loan (which seemed reasonable to a 18 y/o kid...comparing to other private colleges lol). Now it is just about 100K.

No way I can feasibly repay it. The 'school' I went to doesnt exist anymore...like there are literally no buildings lol. SO many students were there with me, they all got hosed. I have to wonder how many people this is going to affect ultimately. If it werent for income based repayment I would be screwed-mcduck."
140,"My mom had it for at least 2+ years with DSL. SO many conversations of mom you dont have to go to aol.com and then google.com. You don't need AOL anymore are you still paying for it???

""But I like getting E-mail!""

""but..."""
141,"I've heard horror stories about those damn cable boxes. My SO mailed his off when he canceled, and I was like ARE YOU CRAZY?! I've heard so many people get stuck paying for a box they mailed because the cable company claims to have never received it. 

When I canceled mine, I went in person and even asked for a receipt."
142,"OP, may I ask what you said to get your money back? My wife has had an Amazon card for a while now; I checked out statements and they are pulling this on us! I had no say in reading terms when she got the card, I wish I had. How should I proceed?

UPDATE:  I had my wife call and use OP's tactic. She was offered 3 months repayment at first, then a full refund (something like $1,200!) I am SO glad I stumbled on this, thanks OP!!!! "
143,"Scam #1:
I can absolutely confirm this. I was also being charged for this service and I never - I WOULD HAVE NEVER - signed up for it. Googling around I found several people who were in the same boat. I contacted them. They apologized and credited my account nearly $1000 in insurance payments.

Scam #2:
Today I learned a new way they were messing with me. I recently chatted with customer support to get a handle on how the promotional balances work. She said very simply, when you make a payment, the next expiring promo balance gets the payment, and any remainder spills over to the _next_ soonest expiring promo balance. Nice. That's what you'd want.

I made a payment yesterday - screenshotting balances first because they don't let you go back and see any sort of running balances. Checking today, the numbers didn't add up. The two soonest expiring balances were slightly different. One (a smaller amount) was 0.48 lower, and the large amount (larger than the payment I made) was reduced by close to what I paid. But there was a $11.69 discrepancy. Chatting with an agent, he said the 11.69 was partially applied to the other balances on the account. I asked why? He said, ""the system allocates the payment randomly"".

WHAT.

So _most_ of the payment went to the promo balance as expected... but the _some_ of it was spread across the other balances that aren't expiring for several months. I asked to see how the last 12 months of payments have been applied to various promo balances, and they said they could not show me that and then the chat disconnected.

SO. It seems by not applying full payments to the soonest expiring balances they're increasing your risk of being stuck with a balance that incurs interest when the promo runs out. VERY SCAMMY.

I would love to know if others have seen similar activity.

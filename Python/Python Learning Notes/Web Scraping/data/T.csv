0,"H/T to Spugliese for this question 

 Hey Mark! Thanks for doing this. What are your thoughts on which services to use? I’m planning on getting g out of RH for obvious reasons, any retail trading companies you’d recommend? I want to support free trade and hit Robinhood in the wallet for what they’ve done here. Also, any legitimacy to a class action suit against them? 

Pick the brokerage with the strongest balance sheet. What ruined it on RH is that they didnt have enough cash to deal with the growth in accounts, margin loans and volatility. The EXACT SAME THING will happen at the next broker if you dont make sure they have a MULTI-TRILLION dollar balance sheet to be able to handle these kind of circumstances 

And there will be class action suits. And they will be combined and they will win and you will get a check for less than $10"
1,">If i borrow a stock from you to short, and when I short it and your buddy buys it, then they can loan it to someone else to short

I finally get it now:

* A loans 1 share to B
* B short sells it to C
* C then loans the share out to D
* D also short sells it

Even though only 1 share is involved the short interest is now 2 because D owes C 1 share, and B owes A 1 share. D could buy and close the short with C, now C has a share that B could buy and close with A and the whole thing is unwound.

Only problem is D sold the share to WSB... and WE AREN'T SELLING!!! 💎🙌"
2,"Well, it really can be explained by laziness. Here's the problem: even though WSB wasn't on silver, the front page was still 95% about silver. Sure, every post was ""SLV IS A LIE DON'T BUY SLV."" But every post is also ""I'm a smooth brained retard and I don't even know what I said here I just punched my keyboard with a butterball turkey until it looked like English.""

Journalists don't want to take the time to figure out if SLV is really a lie or if you're talking in doublespeak to avoid a securities law. But what they do know is their 50 sources called in and said SLV is the push (this was the tactic Cramer cited in his infamous 2006 interview). It's easier to take the source's word for it than to dig in and understand the community at a deeper level."
3,It's so obvious. All of last week it was all love and positive vibes in here with joke memes and solid advice. Only today have I seen a bunch of negative comments telling us to sell and give up. WE WON'T FOLD! HOLD.

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.** 

#WE LIKE THE STOCK

5,"The hedge funds and big money don't realize many of us here, WE HAVE NOTHING TO LOSE. But they have EVERYTHING TO LOSE. For many of us, what is the worst that happens? We go back to having almost no money and struggle with bills, same shit as two weeks ago. 

These fucks sucked all the money from the economy, hoarded it and were here to take a slice of the pie back. This is what happens when the greedy wall street types screw over a generation and we all decide to fight back because some autists here realized you guys had your pants down naked shorting (illegally) GME and it was our chance to put YOUR nuts in a vice. This isn't market manipulation, it's simply the rigged game YOU screw us with screwing YOU over and you're all on TV crying like little bitches. 

I cashed out of my options yesterday, but you know what, at market open, I'm taking all my profits and buying GME, then I'm not selling till be hit 5 digits. Yup, if you want to cover, the price is $10,000 a share. If I loose it all, I DON'T CARE, why? because it's your own money I'm fucking you over with."
6,"I started university pre GFC, finished just as you greedy fuckers destroyed the world economy.

I had a degree in computer science and had promising career prospects and ended up loading trucks for two years while the bailouts happened. I tried to get back in to the I.T. field and basically got told because of my two years I should probably head back to university.

You fucked over the start of my adult life after I did everything sensible and what I should of done according to boomers.

I've slaved my ass off to get where I am now, I'm not wealthy but comfortable. 

I've watched wages stay the same for the last ten years and boomers with assets get richer and richer.

I'm in GME and will stay in until there is some form of repercussion for these rich assholes getting greedy and making a bad trade.

Accept you made a bad trade and pay up."
7,"I joined GME gang for lols, had 1k gambling money and I've bought some shares. I never expected I'm buying a ticket to the wildest ride with people I don't know but respect their wit, humor, self deprecation, honesty. After Melvin is dead the GME can go to zero. I. DON'T. CARE! I only wish I could grab some beer with some of you, sit down, say ""we did it"" and drink it."

EDIT: **🚀**"
10,Incredible the price is holding up as well as it is considering the absolute horse shit going on. Shows real holders AREN'T FUCKING LEAVING.
11,"What I'm worried about is Friday. A lot of people have the idea that the shorts will expire on Friday and that's when the endgame is. 

I have a feeling they will take advantage of this. We must hold until the squueze fellow autists, whenever that may be.

The squeeze probably will NOT happen today. All we will see is options expiring. This will drive the price up. DON'T BE FOOLED THOUGH. This won't be the real squeeze yet! That will probably happen next week.

THEY WILL RELEASE A PRESS STATEMENT AT 9AM, IT WILL ALL BE LIES, DONT BE FOOLED BY IT. DONT LISTEN TO THE MEDIA. HOLD YOUR FUCKING GROUND.

On top of this there will be HUGE SHORT LADDER attacks all throughout the day. DONT BE FOOLED, there is no fucking volume and like yesterday, nobody will be selling!

We will take them for EVERYTHING they have and more. Their bunruptcy is cover by insurance firms, who are also covered until infinity. We will get our money one way or the other!

#SHORT STOCK DOESN'T HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE 

Hedgefund whales are spreading disinfo saying Friday is make-or-break for $GME. Call options expiring ITM on Friday will drive the price up if levels are maintained, but *may not trigger the short squeeze*. 

It may be Friday, but it could be next week the we see the real squeeze. 

#DON'T PANIC IF THE SQUEEZE DOESN'T HAPPEN FRIDAY. 

It's not guaranteed to. The only thing that is *guaranteed* mathematically is that the shorts *will have to cover* at *some* point in the future. They are trying to get enough people hooked on the **false expectation** of Friday so that if/when it doesn't happen, enough will sell out of panic/despair. **DON'T BE THAT PERSON.**

33,"I hear a lot of people claiming that what's happening here with GME is some sort of once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. That there's no way anything even remotely close to what's happening here could ever happen again. That institutions will do everything in their power to MAKE SURE this shit never happens again. On Thursday we witness these institutions attempt just that, and for the first time in the modern history of the stock market, they failed.

On Friday, January 29th, we will witness the top 0.01% pull out ALL THE STOPS, no matter how illegal or how much prison time it will cost them to stop GameStop from rising. If you thought removing the ""BUY"" button from Robinhood was the worst they can do, I promise you, you haven't seen nothing yet.

What happens in these next few days will set a precedent as to how the stock market works in the future. The established billionaires have already risked PRISON TIME in order to stop this movement, because they realize this is bigger than GameStop. Everyone knows the government's gonna bail out their losses anyway (they're billionaires after all), so why the FUCK are they trying so hard to stop this one stock from rising by LITERALLY RISKING A PRISON SENTENCE to stop us?!?!

Because these fuckers know the power of the stock market is slowly on its way to being controlled by the 99%, and this is a landmark moment in that transition.

They know we're setting a precedent that puts the power of the stock market in the diamond hands of the people. Once this shit blows over, everyone and their wife's boyfriends are gonna invest in the stock market because they're gonna have the confidence to do it after seeing what we've done. We're living in a world where ANYBODY can make trades on the market by downloading an app and linking their bank account, and that scares the fuck out of them.
WE could control what businesses are successful, WE could decide the fate our savings accounts, WE, the 99% of the population, could even out the playing field and put an end to the wealth disparity crisis plaguing America and the rest of the world.

On Friday, January 29th, and the days after, we're gonna see the richest men on earth do everything in their power to stop this precedent we're creating, and make sure the average Joe never thinks about investing in the market again cuz it's ""too risky"", and the odds aren't in their favour. These 0.01%ers are gonna lie, cheat, do we everything in their power, AND MORE to nosedive the price of GME and convince you to sell.

They know we're gonna make BANK if we don't sell, they know how big of a news story this is turning out to be, that's why the greediest fucks on earth are so willing to go on national news and expose themselves, cuz once word gets out that the most retarded people on the planet make ABSOLUTE BANK by just believing in themselves and the people around them, everyone's gonna hop on the stock market train and try taking it for a ride to tendy town. WE can set a new precedent in the world, and ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR SHARES.

THAT'S IT! THAT'S LITERALLY ALL IT TAKES! For years the billionaires have won every time by using their money and power to tip the odds and their favour, and WallStreetBets are the ones that cracked the code to beating them. JUST DON'T SELL!!! These guys are gonna pull the craziest shit these next few days to force your hand. We could see the stock rise to $1,000 a share, only too plummet to $5 in a matter of minutes, AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA SELL SHIT!!!

We're living in a timeline where the most retarded community on the entire internet has a chance to be the ones that take down the biggest assholes living on this earth, and literally change the financial world forever. ALL YOU MOTHERFUCKERS HAVE TO DO IS HOLD YOUR MOTHERFUCKING SHARES!!!

Fuck the moon, we got the gas the get to Andromeda. Are you willing to come along for the ride and make history? DON'T SELL!"

The WSB where everyone was in pure option plays for an earnings play or long-term play, and we'd laugh at the fucking idiot who had a week to go on his 1 yr call option, sitting at -95%... Only for that mother fucker to hit 300% on that very friday.

WSB'ers know the game. They know what it's like to be hurting, squeezing for adding in more margin, getting in that last contract even though you're a blow away from GUHing your future. Know what we'd do? ""Just delete the app, restart!""

You morons are crying about going down 30 and 40%? No. You're already a paper holding F*G**T. If you didn't have the confidence of knowing that you may be down 80% tomorrow, but will be up 300% at the end of the week, then you shouldn't of been in this trade in the first place.

This is a kind of trade financial advisors scream at you for doing because its idiotic, foolhardy, and plain retarded. That's why this will *work*. BUT ONLY IF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME BEING PLAYED.

So shut up about your paper handing bullshit because no one wants to hear it.

42,"SHORT LADDER ATTACK INCOMING HOLD HOLD HOLD UP VOTE AND SHARE


In the last hour of trading some of us are predicting they will launch a short ladder attack to make it look like it’s selling off to trick you into selling your shares. Their goal is to go under $115 to get out of their expiring contracts. This will be a major victory for them.


Hedge funds sell back and forth with one another at lower and lower bids in rapid succession, tricking algorithms into thinking there is a mass sell off when there actually isn’t. (They do this to scare off retail investors to engineer a sell off). Once the attack is over, the stock will normally go back up due to its demand. Then they will rinse and repeat their attack, each time hoping to chip away more and more retail investors. Most people in here know this, so if retail investors are selling, it’s unlikely that it’s anyone at all.


ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS HOLD HOLD HOLD! DON'T GET PAPER HANDS DURING THE LAST HOUR, ITS WHAT THEY WANT!

47,"This is how this ends this upcoming week: theres been a lot of buying of short term dated call options on stocks all over the market. There was a lot of unusual options activity the past few days. So what does this mean? While retail has been selling their value stocks to chase a meme fomoing in, algorithms follow that price action & drive the market down to get people to bleed. Notice how GME was up during that entire downturn? Then as the market started recovering a bit GME started a downturn (ladder attack) and they made a killing forcing people to sell their calls through robinhood at some really low prices relative to where they were at open. I am of the belief that other stocks will start to rip this next week & people will fomo into those while GME slowly bleeds throughout the week from a high open. They’re going to propel the market up after accumulating a bunch of paper hand value stocks & options, and then as GME dies down, people are going to have to chase that runaway train that is the market ripping. And when they’ve bought back in high, they’ll get crushed back down again and the house will win. They’re going to keep manipulating the stock. Just my two cents. I’m seeing stuff right now that I only saw at the zealous height of B T C ( 💩c0in) and the “H O D L” mentality. I’m pro GME, but the amount of super bullish unusual options activity on stocks market wide I saw this week leads me to believe this next act will be one of the wilder ones."

63,"Wait what.. how?

I am not eating. My wife is not eating. My kids are not eating. (We like this stonk!)

I held enough back to feed the good bois because those doggos do not have a voice (Though being good doggos they would TOTALLY give up their Pretendies to support the effort, but because Elon has decided to delay the Dog Translator to 2025 I feel it's important not to imply doggo voice until then.. thus they get fed.

With the $$ I've saved from not buying lattes in the last week I bought another .364 share... and that's saying something BECAUSE I DON'T DRINK COFFEE!

 Hold that line."
64,"FR! Like WTF..I’m just over here having lost LITERALLY hundreds of thousands....I lost $100k when I cashed out all my money to buy in and I lost $200k more because RH tanked the entire thing and left most of us in ruins. So feel free to give back right over here since you’re holding a bag of cash smh. 

SIDE NOTE: I SURE HOPE EVERY DAMN SOUL ON HERE CLOSES THEIR RH ACCOUNT AND STICK IT TO THE REAL DIRTBAGS; THE SHRIFF OF NOTTINGHAM!! CUZ I CAN PROMISE YOU ANDREW LEFT WHO CAME TO OUR DEFENSE AFTER HE LOST IS NOT THE ENEMY IT’S THAT SHIT PILE MFR VLAD AND ROBINHOOD WHO RUINED US. 

FRANKLY IM KINDA SHOCKED THAT WE AREN’T RAGING AT THAT ASSHOLE: WE HIT $500!! THEN IT WAS ALL DESTROYED BY THAT SCUMBAG ON OUR WAY TO $1000!

SO SORRY I’VE GOT NOTHING LEFT TO DONATE SMDH"
65,"About a month ago, AT&T decided I needed an upgrade so they picked one out for me.  I got a notice from my bank about my debit card being charged $90 (I get an email for all charges on that card, and link all auto-pay bills to it so I can see who charged me what).  I looked into why I was getting hit for another AT&T charge and found it was for ordering a Samsung Galaxy Note 8.  Then I got an email thanking me for my order.

When I called them, I thought someone hacked my account and was buying shit.  After a brief conversation, they told me it was a promotion offering me an upgrade and that I wouldn't be charged.  I told them I already had, the money has left my bank account without my approval, this was now theft.

After talking to many people I got them to refund the order, refund my last two bills, and cancel my AT&T account. 

In short, AT&T are not satisfied with just screwing people over with hidden fees, they are thieves.  Fuck AT&T."
66,"I just want to personally thank you for outing them. Consumers should do this as much as possible on sites just like these because basically AT&T was attempting to STEAL money from you. I don't care if they aren't breaking into your home or robbing you at gun point, this is theft. I wish I could give you more than one upvote. "
67,">feel like AT&T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. 

There was a reason why the government had to break up AT&T in 1984. There's a reason now the government need to break up AT&T again, and keep it that way."
68,"A year ago my Cox plan was 'unlimited'. Then it turned to a 1TB limit with data caps and overage charges with zero improvements and speed degrades due to extra tracking.  

Then after a year or 18 months I got tired of overages, they suddenly add back 'unlimited' but it is 150% the old 'unlimited' rate.  

The new trick is removing unlimited, then implementing or tightening data caps, then adding unlimited back again at a minimum of 50% increase of cost.  Then do this annually or every 1-2 years.  

AT&T did the same thing with the grandfathered 'unlimited' plans on mobile, they kept upping the cost, then you had to switch to metered, then 'unlimited' comes back at a minimum of 50% increase.  This is the new game. 40-50% increase by switching between metered/limited and 'unlimited' which they nerf you after 20GB.

I guess since healthcare and tuition go up by 20-50% every year that broadband and telcos were sad they weren't in on the new middle class killing predatory pricing that happens in the US now."
69,"AT&T is shady, I switched to them as a my cell carrier, because Sprint didn't have service in the area I was moving to. Long story short they agreed to buy out my contract up to 650 dollars. After 6 months of a run around trying to get them to hold up the contract i have 700 dollars in collections from sprint.  The second my contract is up im done with them. "
70,"I've had AT&T for less than a month and they've already pissed me off. 

First, we used to have Spectrum, but then we moved and it's not offered (yet) at our new apartment. So I signed up with AT&T a few weeks ago and the ""best"" plan they have doesn't allow for me to watch Netflix (on lowest res) while my bf plays WoW or other online stuff without him getting lag. Strike #1. This never happened with Spectrum. 

Okay, strike 2 and 3. I signed up to get the $99 installation fee as a $33/month installment over 3 bills. I logged in a week ago and for my first bill, the whole $99 was on there. Wtf? I looked at my original email confirmation for my order to make sure I did it right. Nope, supposed to be $33/month for 3 months. I open a chat with a CS rep and tell him what's going on, he apologizes and says he's fixing it. I get an email confirmation from AT&T confirming that he's fixed it. 

Then, yesterday, I log into my account to pay my first bill, which is due 1/6. This is a week after I contacted CS to fix the installation fee- should be enough time to get it fixed, but it's still showing up as a $99 charge on my first bill instead of 33. 

Like, what the fuck? This is AT&T, not some small town ho-dunk company or whatever. It's my very first bill and somehow they cannot get something so simple right? Why? At any rate, they did redeem themselves, because when I contacted customer service again, the next guy immediately waived the fee entirely, so that was nice. But I'm still not happy about the speed or the fact that they fucked up my *very first bill, twice*. 

 "
71,"Some time ago, I was working in AT&T as customer support for almost a year. It was my first corporate job, and I was in a time of need so I had to take it. I left and a boulder fell of my hearth, seriously. That company is shit, all my friends from there left as well, the fluctuation of employees on that department is epic. I am talking about U-Verse. The lies and all that crap that we were supposed to tell the customers about ""free promotions"", unlimited internet which has its limit as well, sending technician to fix your issue etc, new free router my ass, they were almost all returned by customers and damaged/repaired and sent out new... I had to leave because this was unbearable to anyone with common sense and a little bit of empathy towards people. I felt bad about myself doing my job ! It was not right. Not to mention the promises from the leadership to employees. They lied to us just like they lie to you. Every time I hear the name Diamond and see the brand AT&T I want to vomit. Don't trust AT&T, check your bills and be aware of the dirty tricks and tactics they are using.
"
72,"Sorry if I wrote a lot on this post, I just wanted to inform people about something else they try to do by changing your payment cycle so they can add on extra fees and penalties. 

I had cell service with AT&T and something like this happened to me with my billing cycle. I signed up for cell service with AT&T. I also signed up to be billed on the first of the month I had them put that in my contract. The first month I received a text on the 22nd of the month saying if I didn’t pay my bill my phone would be turned off. I didn’t think anything of it so I paid. Next month same thing happens I get a text on the 22nd saying my bill is over due. This time I called them up to see what is going on. I talked to billing and ask why I am getting text saying my bill is late when I had it setup to be paid on the first. This is when I am informed that my cycle  starts on the 15th and end on the 15th. I told them they’re wrong the contract said the first and they need to change it. The person told me that It couldn’t happen until the start of a new billing cycle. Well I was pissed by this time. My contract was changed without my authorization. In the mean time I asked to be connected to customer services to see why I keep getting threatening texts and emails. I was transferred to customer service where they automatically hung up on me. So I called them back and asked to transferred to customer service and  I would get someone they would hang up on me. Right after that I get online to talk to a rep because I felt there was more they could do. The guy informs me that he could switch my billing cycle right away and does have to wait for the new billing cycle to start. He also said he would look into why customer service hung up on me. I felt I was taken care of and got off with customer service. Once off  I had the conversation emailed to me so I had a record of what I was told. I also received an email from AT&T confirming my billing cycle had changed. 

Fast forward to the next months billing cycle, and I get the same issue texts and emails threatening me to pay my bill or my service will be turned off. So again I contact the online help. This time they try and say nothing was done and all that happened was an extension was made on my cycle for a month. They said  I never had a conversation about changing my billing cycle and what I was saying was untrue. So I start to copy and past all the information I was told from the last customer support rep and also the email AT&T sent me to confirm my billing cycle had changed. Just like magic they started to see that they did change my billing cycle. However they couldn’t change it back for another three months. I informed them that due to the fact my contract with AT&T was originally signed to have my bill be paid on the first and they had changed without my consent. They had breached my original contract by changing my billing cycle without consent. Since they decided to jerk me around I informed them I was no longer going to continue my service with them. They tried to say I had to pay them for a phone and my phone bill. However, when I informed them they had breached the original contract I had setup to pay my bill on the first of the month and in doing so made the original contract null and void, and that included my payments on the phone. They agreed that I didn’t have to pay my phone off or my cell phone bill. 

So it goes to show you get everything in writing, keep the contract and if you contact them over a billing issue or any issue get a transcript of what you were told. That way if someone try’s to jerk you around and tell you something else you have proof you were told a different thing. "
73,"AT&T internet is so bad that that kept messing up my speed or billing every month, totally screwed up my cell phone bill (I don't even know how), and when I cancelled it and returned the equipment, they kept billing me for 3 months until I finally got a notice that I was behind in payment. *I was out of the country for half that time, why the fuck would I want their shatty service while I was gone???* Never got an apology or a discount or reduction on the bill. 

So I paid the fucking thing and share my story anytime anyone mentions AT&T internet. They will fuck you over every chance they get.

AT&T, if you're reading this, you made an enemy of me for life. I will *never* be your customer again and I'll take as many customers from you as will follow."
74,"I know this will get burried :) but I worked for AT&T many years ago. Shady stuff like this is the tip of the dark iceberg. You have no idea the number of shady stuff they do. Most ISPs are pretty bad, but AT&T is the absolute worst by far."
75,"Is this specifically an AT&T isp practice, or does this also occur with their phone service? And if it applies to their phone service how would I check to see if this happened to me?"
76,I knew a girl who worked at an AT&T store and quit because she was literally giving back a total of over $1000 in refunds for multiple kinds of bullshit every single week. She was disgusted by them.
77,"Last month we found that our bill had been charged by AT&T an additional $18 for no reason. They cited ""service fee"" for the charge but we hadn't ordered anything. After hours of phone calls, they finally agreed to drop the charge.

On a side note, about six months ago our fee for our internet went up by like $25. Because it happened out of nowhere, we called them and they said that we weren't paying what we were ""supposed to"" for the service/speed that we have, so those $25 were for us to pay ""full price"". Anyway, after a while or discussing over the the phone, the representative agreed to keep our fee the same for a ""small"" change in speed. The guy said that right now we have the internet speed of 24MPS, and the speed will change to 6,000KBS. Now, I know that 6,000KPS is really equal to about 6MPS, or one-fourth of our current internet speed. When I explained this to the representative he laughed it off and said that 6,000KPS definitely sounds bigger than it is, and we just ended the conversation there after convincing him to leave our service alone.

Anyway, bottom line, check your bills, everybody, because I'm pretty sure this happens all the time."
78,"Alright, so I worked for AT&T in the ""Unified Collections"" department. You know how if you have more than one service with AT&T, they may talk to you about combining your bills for a discount? Once they are combined, they are handled in a new department. Now, we get the short of the stick there as while each department is responsible for itself, we were responsibily knowing the full extent of all of these departments: U-verse, Mobility (cell phones), DirectV, and finally the other portion of u-verse (their television). I myself worked there for a little while and ended up heading an MST team (they are the ""managers"" you talk to. Yes, you don't actually talk to our managers, they are just a team of people with a little more power and freedom and able to descalate. Funny story about the MST, when you ask to speak to an MST's manager, we would just pass it to another person on the MST. haha). I also did training, so I know those four departments like the back of my hand. I no longer work there, but it wasn't that long ago I did.

Things to consider about OP's situation: It's very likely he had a discount before they upgraded his internet, and that discount would have been running off at the same time as this one is, and thus the net price would be the same. I can't know for sure as it's not like I can access his account. If you view your bill before and after the change happened, you might see something surprising. It could also have been his contract which ensured he got a price is running up finally, and he should call back and get another one, but it all depends on his situation. 

Honestly, with all the issues going on, you'd be surprised how little of it is a true AT&T error and how much of it is just deceptive advertising. Your first bill from them (if combined billing) may be 2x the price you are expecting, but that is because you already technically had a bill that had a balance of 0.00, it's just not explained well. It's absolutely AT&T's fault for not training their employee's near well enough, and not explaining anything to the customers. However, I think in this case what happened is his contract is up, U-Verse typically has a price guarantee contract you sign for either two or three years, so this would make sense (it can be 2 1/2 years as well).

/u/ghostofgbt I would go ahead and recommend you call the IVR (The number on your bill) and talk to a rep and ask to speak to sales to get another contract signed up for your internet to save money. That, or you can talk to loyalty and say you are displeased about them not notifying you and you're going to leave them unless they get your price down. 

For anyone else with AT&T problems, I will go ahead and say that in my entire time working there, if it was ever found to be an AT&T error, it would always be corrected (albeit you'd have to call about it, the system doesn't just catch it), and you'd be given credits as well. A large part of why your bill goes up and everything has to do with all the fine terms, like I know in unified you got a certain amount off your bill for 3 services combined, versus 2, and u-verse was required for any discount. There's a lot of fine details, but if you have patience and talk to their reps, or look at the bill yourself online, you should be able to find it.

However! There are a lot of shitty reps in AT&T, not all departments are created equally, much less the CSR's themselves. So, it may require jumping around.

Final notice here is this is for base AT&T stuff and not the acquired DirecTV. I will go ahead and say right now that DirecTV scams its users, to the point that it should be illegal. They will give you an early termination fee you don't know about, when the sales rep may assure you there is none. They WILL say they they have fixed it and removed it, while not actually removing it at all. I would say avoid getting DirecTV at all costs, and if you must, then record what the sales rep tells you and make him write down his DirecTV number on a paper that also says you will not have to pay an ETF. Seriously, in the time I was working there I saw in the notes alone plenty of examples of where stuff was supposed to be removed (like, the notes said they were going to remove it), and then it was never done. Do not trust DirecTV and monitor your bill closely. 

Alright that's all I have to say, figured my insight could help a few know what to do. Feel free to ask if anyone has any quick questions about AT&T billing or resources to fix them and monitor. I obviously can't go into AT&T policy without getting arrested, but I can definitely guide the way to making sure you get the best you can out of your AT&T service. Finally, only billing, loyalty, or managers can issue credits that are not caused by an actual error (but something that was confusing or bad service), so don't demand credits from your customer service reps. You are going to get them if there was an actual AT&T ""error"" (sorry, I can't define them, but pretty much system messed up or something), however you are still entitled to credits if you were told one thing and another happens, so feel free to get to a manager for that.

Also I will never have AT&T, after working there. I work for t-mobile now, dealing with small/medium businesses, but I know those who are just basic CSRs and I can say if you want a company that actually has decent customer service and more lenient policies, go to them. 

"
79,That $5 fee is the extra money they're collecting for the new $20 worth of service you're getting. God I fucking hate AT&T. Greedy money grabbers. 
80,"I recently made a new account with AT&T. Told them I wanted just Internet, no other services. They gave me a particular price. On my online account, it showed me being signed up for Internet and landline, and paying a higher amount. I called again and explained. I was told the package deal would make the Internet cheaper. Still, I didn’t want a landline, and the Internet on its own was cheaper than the package. They fixed it, but it shouldn’t gave been slipped in. "
81,"Fuck AT&T. I had a friendly recently try to sign up for internet service with AT&T. Their ""professional"" installer no-called/no-showed *twice* while my friend took time out of his schedule to wait. But just incase *that* wasn't bad enough the fuckers sent him a *bill*.

Fuck AT&T. Fuck them right in their face. "
82,"It may have been noted already but I think it's worth mentioning that while this was done on purpose by someone in AT&T, the people in the call center most likely aren't the ones doing this, and they're just repeating the rhetoric that was fed to them by supervisors. They may know what is going on, but they're most likely just as frustrated that their company put them in a position to field these calls and apologize for the company doing something shady. As infuriating as this may be, if it was done to you, try to stay calm when talking to a rep. They'll be more likely to help you and you won't ruin their day."
83,"AT&T are scumbags. They let my dad keep his old plan for 4 years before someone finally mentioned he could save a huge amount of money by updating to a newer plan, we were paying near $300 a month for two phones and no one said a thing about it. After we found out the next call my dad made was to cancel, and then we used our T-mobile rebate cards at AT&T to pay off the remaining balance. Fuck AT&T.
Edit: he was a 25 year customer, before they were even AT&T"
84,"After AT&T pushed to remove consumer protections under Title II (Net Nuetrality), I am planning on leaving their customer base after nearly a decade. It seems that AT&T doesn't actually have respect for their customers at all."
85,"I'd put all this info in an FCC complaint. While the FCC hates consumers now, at least there will be more public records against AT&T and their billing practices."
86,"I got so sick of Comcast jacking my rates up every time my latest promotion ended. I finally cut the cable cord and insisted on the lowest Internet speed. It’s like 15 MB and it works just fine for streaming Netflix or Amazon prime. When they try to jack my rates up… Luckily there is a Comcast account center near me and I go in person and tell them “I don’t want any new services. I want to keep paying $20 a month for the lowest speed of Internet” and I don’t walk out until they make that happen. I’m always really friendly but firm. 

It’s an incredibly stupid business model to overcharge people and make customers so frustrated.  Why can’t Comcast and AT&T just charge what the service is actually worth instead of all this “promotion then we double your charges and hope you don’t notice” bullshit? It’s so unethical but customers don’t have any choice if they want Internet. "
87,I have two friends that work at an authorized AT&T dealer store. Basically looks like your normal everyday AT&T store but is actually run by a completely different company that AT&T pays to sell you shit and up your monthly plans. Both friends have said how stressful the job and overall experience has been due to the constant lying and overcharging they have to do to customers. They’re forced to deceive people everyday and that’s pretty messed up
88,"So glad I dropped this garbage company last year. The tipping point for me came when I went in to change something about my phone plan and they had a salesperson try to pitch U-Verse to me. I was 100% not interested and said as much, but the salesperson kept pushing so finally I agreed to have a rep come out to my house and talk to me more about U-Verse. I have a hard time just saying no and by this point I just wanted to conversation to end so I could leave, which is the only reason I agreed to this. I made very sure to have the salesperson verify that this was JUST for someone to come to my house to TALK about the service, I wasn't agreeing to purchase anything. She said that was the case, and so I left. A month later I had forgotten about it until I get a call from AT&T to confirm that I would be home for somebody to come out and install U-Verse. I said absolutely not and told them I didn't want it and I didn't want anyone to come to my house. I was freaking livid. I hate AT&T, and with that incident, among many other shady practices, I am no longer a customer. I honestly can't understand how they are able to get away with shit like that and stay in business."
89,@OP: just think if *any* company the size of AT&T decided to charge *every customer* one dollar more per month. How many ppl would notice? and now how many people would fight the charge? hire a lawyer? over a dollar and they could stand to make an extra tens of millions that month for an *oversight* or *error*.
90,"AT&T a few months ago, when I decreased my internet speed, put a “hardware fee” on my account of $15 per month. I OWN that equipment...I bought it when I started my service. 

I called them and they said if I increase my speed again, this fee will go away...so this fee was just random and didn’t actually have anything to do with hardware.


Absolute fucks."
91,"TD Bank got some heat in Canada for doing something similar to this recently to their customers http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/td-bank-employees-admit-to-breaking-law-1.4016569

This is often caused by the tone at the top of the organization. AT&T likely has some sort of performance measures that their reps have to adhere by. Reps who did poorly at TD might feel the pressure of losing their jobs and would often tack on random services to customer accounts without their permission or their knowledge. This would ""boost"" performance, and award them with any bonuses and allow them to keep their jobs under the guise that they're ""doing well"".

This can happen to more than just your internet bill. It's very important we all be aware of the bills we're auto paying."
92,"I left AT&T when I started to be charged for exceeding a data cap that I never agreed to. I was with them for internet starting 2010 (and 2003 with a cell phone), and left in 2016 because Fuck AT&T."
93,I see all these people complaining about their cell phones. On AT&T or Verizon plans.   Give t-mobile a try.  They really have great service.  And even better customer support. 
94,"In 2005 I had AT&T as my cell provider.  I was a broke college kid and my bill was consistently being overbilling for taxes. 

On average I was being billed an extra 25 cents a bill.  I spoke to several people in the phone, yet no one could tell me the itemized tax calculation. 

I checked with local taxes, state, etc and my calculated portion was always less than what I was billed.

After several calls I cancelled them simply based on the  principle of being overcharged.  Sure, 25 cents isn't much, but that's $3 a year times millions of customers.  That's a lot of money.

Its time we stick it to these blood sucking leeches of companies and leave them. "
95,"Believe you me, if my AT&T bill changes a cent, I'm on the phone lol."
96,"As someone who used to work for AT&T, this isn't surprising. Call, raise hell, but please do not blame the Customer Service Rep. Remember, it's not their call to raise prices."
97,"I would personally remove the name of the person you spoke with so they are not pursued in a witch hunt, this is one of those ""don't kill the messenger"" situations and AT&T is at fault not the guy on the phone."
98,"Worked in a third-party call center for AT&T, and we were encouraged to do this. We also were encouraged to switch people from AT&T U-Verse to DirecTV without informing the customer, too. Didn't matter that it never got installed, it was about the monthly upgrade numbers and the switch...and then sometimes Uverse was the focus over DirecTV, and we'd spend a month switching DTV customers to UVerse. 
"
99,"I used to work for AT&T and I can confirm for a fact they add shit to bills at random, the sales guys are all lazy liars, and they will change things without customer consent if they feel like it.

I got tired of AT&T's crap."
100,"Thanks for the heads up Brother. I don’t even have AT&T but I’m gonna be more vigilant when it comes to checking my bills from now on. Thanks to Congress thinking that “corporations will always behave ethically” I’m sure this type of shit will start happening more often. Again, you da real MVP"
101,"AT&T do some of the scummiest things an ISP can possibly do. Here are two of my experiences.

1) When we first looked into switching to them they told us about the cheap prices and high speeds. Not too long later, after taking a look at the bill we realized that there was a cap at 300gb a month, and for someone who does PC gaming, and downloads a lot of things that went by in a week or two. They just so happen to forget to mention that to us.

2) I had heard that Time Warner Cable was doing free upgrades in certain areas and I called at&t to see if they had anything like that. To my surprise they ""did"". I asked several times to make sure nothing will be added to my bill and the lady told me that there won't be a single penny charged. Next month there was an extra $40 on my bill. I called customer service and they told me that the lady I talked to had made a note on my account that we were upgrading our plan, but nothing about the free upgrade. I asked them to review the call recording and they said that they will not. That day I cancelled with them and got time Warner."
102,"This. 

I left AT&T in November, cancelled services (so I thought) and paid my final bill. About a month later I received an email from them so I logged into my account to see an additional charge of $82.xx. My final bill was already paid to $0, so I gave them a call, exchanged chats via their online portal and finally went to Twitter when I wasn’t getting answers.

Turns out they buried a $10 per month data charge from a “free” tablet (for purchasing 2 iPhones) we received in 2014, that went missing then same day we got it. I found that $10 charge back in 2015 and asked that it be cancelled. Long story short they never cancelled the tablets data charge and the $82.xx was a monthly fee for that data plan after I cancelled my cell phone service. I never noticed the $10 data charge because my bill went down by $10 when I asked to cancel services on that tablet. Turns out that they switched around my plan and BOOM- I had no idea. Shady shit I tell ya.

Moral of the story- hit up twitter to resolve these types of issues. Although I settled and paid $40 of that $82.xx, the people manning the social media accounts are somewhat helpful."
103,"Sitting in the doctors room with my mom when I stumble upon this. We have AT&T uverse packaged internet/TV. I look over to my mom and mention, “hey, we need to check the bill when we get home for AT&T cause they’re pulling bullshit again”....”Oh, daddy already caught that last week. He was PISSED.” "
104,"I worked for AT&T in a call center for over 4 years. The turnover rate is unbelievable in a place like that. I started in mobility(billing) and transferred to Uverse technical support after a year. Doesn't matter which department your in, just working for them makes you feel like a thief. The big wigs don't care if their customers are not Happy because they're not the ones who have to deal with them, and the customers will continue to pay. They constantly make little changes to get more money out of people. I'm thinking of making a list of all the little subtle and nasty changes that were made while I was there to scam the people who pay them. The worst part was I would have to defend AT&T for doing it, convince the customer why it was okay that we were taking even more of their money. AT&T makes me sick."
105,"Not saying that I take the side of AT&T's, I'm a former employee, I am aware of their potential evilness. But this potential for a service upgrade was stated up front when you registered the service or if it's been longer, by some sort of communication explaining the ""service"". At some point you agreed to this by continuing to purchase the services or by your silence following their attempts (lame as they are ) to reach out to you. Still doesn't make it right, it's just not true by saying ""without customer consent"". "
106,"They just applied a “free downgrade” to my cell phone last month. All streaming video will only be available in 480p as a new “feature” to help with my data usage, even though I have unlimited data. When I try to go into the account to turn it off they say it’s not currently possible to turn it off and to check back later. I’m currently looking in to what company I should switch all 12 business lines across 3 accounts  to. I’ve been with AT&T since before they sold off their cell business and then bought it back  15 years ago. They finally went too far."
107,"I work for AT&T and I have never in my life heard of anything like this happening. Especially because if we were going to charge you the taxes on one of your next installments, the only way we could do that is by taking your credit card information and running it through our system (our sales systems won't keep your credit card on file, even if you have it on file in our billing system, which doesn't have the full number), or unless you did it online or in a store. We can not charge a device to your account for later payment either.

Either all of our systems apparently work different for you or something is being excluded. Don't get me wrong, the company is an endrich nightmare to work for, but your story isn't adding up."
108,"People shouldn't ever set up autopay with any of the cable/dsl ISP's. All of them are crooked as hell. AT&T, Spectrum,  Comcast - none are to be trusted ever. You will eventually regret that convenient autopay."
109,They'll all be buried by pro-AT&T comments.
110,"I've had multiple similar problems with AT&T recently. 

1. I got a phone call at like 7:30am one morning saying bc of being a loyal customer, they were switching me to the premium channels for an additional $10 a month (for like 3 months and then it'd be normal cost). I told them no thanks. The lady then told me that they were going to just do it and it was easy for me to cancel at any time. I had to literally yell at this woman and then ask for a supervisor to confirm they didn't make the change, and then still had to actively watch my account b/c I didn't trust them. 

2. My bill suddenly just jumped a substantial amount one day. I looked at the billing notes and saw a bunch of notes about promo rates ending. I looked at my agreement info that said the promo rates should be going on for another year or so. So I called, and the guy told me that the day those rates went into effect for 2 years, someone had changed it later that same day to 1 year (or some other time frame, i don't remember), and asked me if I had done that? Why the fuck would I have done that? Ultimately they made my rate lower than it was because that specific offered could no longer be tied to my account but a better one was available blah blah blah. 

I really should change, but I missed out on that locked in lifetime DirecTV streaming deal (tho i'm sure they pull shenanigans there too), so my only options are AT&T, Comcast, or nothing/apps. Highly considering switching to just internet and apps, but would still need internet from one of them. "
111,"I used to work for AT&T U-verse up until about a year ago. At the time, there was talk of upgrading people on certain plans to the next speed free, like the message says. From what a little person like me was told, it was just to get people a higher speed, not to charge them more. 

I would guess the billing system jacked it up like it always did. Maybe some promo that got dropped with the speed bump, some promos only worked with certain speed tiers. Going from, say, 18mb to 24mb could void a promo, so the price could actually be more than the usual $5 price increase. Their OMS was a huge mess, and every upgrade seemed to go backwards. So many things were broken or features taken away that we had to  do some convoluted workaround it was ridiculous. Very be gone from that place."
112,"Yup. Autopay is just asking for it. They can tell even when the bank invokes it by comparing when it's sent. They know who's paying attention and who isn't.

Multiplied by even just a few thousand customers every month for a year, even $5 makes a difference. AT&T is well above a few thousand customers. It pays to have analysts who look at things like this."
113,"Its the T2000 of corporations...it just won't die. Like seriously: who is loyal to AT&T? They are a malignant monopoly, in many areas of the country."
114,"There is a state agency who will go after them with enough complaints.

Report this to your state's Attorney General's office. Very often, if they get enough shady shit like this reported, they'll sue the company to stop it. Sometimes you'll get a refund, sometimes nothing comes of it, but the thing is that you HAVE TO REPORT IT.

Companies like AT&T count on not enough people being engaged enough to file complaints with all of their consumer watchdogs. The FIRST one you should always go to is your state's AG. That person is politically motivated and can build a large following by pursuing shit like this. I've gotten results from complaints against companies as large as AAA, who  fucked me on insurance, and I've gotten nice ""thanks for the report"" letters. No guarantee, but if there's a recourse and enough voters complaining, they'll follow that recourse.

Also, why the fuck are you still dealing with AT&T? This isn't a natural monopoly under a Public Utilities commission. There are alternatives.  That company is the devil, and always has been. They were fucking me over 20 years ago, and they're still evil. When iPhones came out I stuck with my razr specifically because you had to have AT&T to get one, and these days you can get an equivalent quality phone that'll work on just about any carrier.

Vote with your feet. For a cellphone you can always jump to Verizon or T-Mobile, and you can take your phone number with you, so no harm no foul. "
115,"The FCC is under regulatory capture by AT&T, Verizon, and friends. They don't give two shits about any of this."
116,"[AT&T actually won the key Supreme Court arbitration case that allows it to avoid consumer class-actions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AT%26T_Mobility_LLC_v._Concepcion)

The only answer is to go to arbitration en masse and make it cost AT&T hundreds of millions in attorney fees.  Or convince the very busy Attorney Generals of your state to pursue legal action."
117,"Except class action suits are banned by their Alternate Dispute Resolution clauses in their terms of service, which you agree to by ordering and using their services.

AT&T was the one who won the supreme court case that allowed those clauses to supersede any right to class action suits under law."
118,"I can't speak to AT&T specifically, but I CAN speak on Cricket, which is owned by AT&T.

They definitely do these scummy kinds of things. Cricket has I think 4 or 5 plans, which cost different amounts and give you different amounts of high speed data. They have not changed prices for me, however they change the amount of data each plan gets seemingly at random, this affects active acounts. 

The worst example of this was a couple years ago. My payment had literally just gone through the day before for a plan that I want to say was 5 gb high speed (it was either 5 or 8). Suddenly I get a text that says ""changes have been made to my plan"" and prompts me to view the website. Literally the day after my bill for the 5gb high speed plan goes through, they cut me back to 3gb/month.

I will say of them though that this seemed completely random (I've gained data as often as I've lost it) and mostly seemed to happen when AT&T was taking them over. There weren't a lot of issues before or after."
119,"Unfortunately they literally don’t care if you leave, they make way more off of new customers and the initial signup then they do off your monthly bill.

120,"This is a feature that can easily be removed if you talk to the right representative. Corporate AT&T likes to lie about stupid shit like this. We literally have to click a checkbox and hit submit.  
  
In their slight defense it is now a standard feature on all AT&T lines. However there is absolutely no reason they can’t remove it. "
121,"File a claim with the FTC. If I recall correctly, AT&T has to respond to FTC claims within 24 hours. 

You have a slam dunk case on your hand. Don't roll over and let them fuck you like that. "
122,"AT&T uses this to their advantage. They put ignorant powerless people in front of the phones to act as meatshields. They do it to make their customers feel bad about getting angry.

It's the same concept as putting your military base right next to a school and a hospital. You've made it so that your enemies can't attack you without hurting innocents."
123,"""But the only people that will be hurt are the customers...""

Yeah right, internet prices in Kansas city dropped over night once Google got in. 1 gigabit/second for $70 dollars, which AT&T MATCHED, and yet I'm still paying $70 for 40 megabits/second in a fully uncontested area."
124,"Seriously speaking - what would the AG even do? Pursuing legal action takes money, and AT&T likely have way more than what the AG  can put forth. "
125,"AT&T fucked my employer over. So the CFO switched 12,000 cell phones and 15,000 pagers over to T-Mobile in less than a month."
126,"I had a grandfathered unlimited plan too, did not change my name/mailing address/account info and they simply told me they no longer honored it.

Even if her info didn't change, they would've taken it away... still better than AT&T."
127,"I also used to work for AT&T (on the wireless side) and I can tell you what is likely happening here. When I worked there about 10 years ago, during slow times in the store, the managers would have us cold call customers who had outdated data or text plans and offer them a 'free' upgrade and tell them how it would save all this money.


Well, we figured out really quickly that people don't like to be cold called, so what ended up happening was that many sales reps would go through accounts and see who had old billing codes or plans attached to them, and then they would just upgrade them themselves without consulting the customer. The salesperson got commission for 'selling' a data upgrade, and the customer was usually left in the dark about it. The managers seemed aware of this, but didn't care as it helped the stores metrics. "
128,"Piggybacking because fuck AT&T.

Would there be any sort of claim for someone being blackmailed to pay a large (1k-ish) cell bill after their parent died?  ATT threatened to sue if he didn't pay because he made a payment on the contract (his phone as well) after she died, completely unaware that there was a balance.  He paid the bill to avoid confrontation because he didn't have a lawyer and any he consulted with weren't interested."
129,AT&T tried to pull that one on me when I switched to Comcast. I DIDN’T make a copy of my receipt unfortunately but I’m a hard ass so literally just told them “no” and to fuck off. For about six months I got collection calls and from then on they’ve left me alone. Hasn’t affected my credit score and I haven’t been dragged into court so I’m assuming they gave up. 
130,"Right but have you ever had to try to get the cable company to pay you back? They drag their feet for months. I've had this experience with TWC, Comcast, AT&T, and especially Spectrum. None of them give you any kind of discount for autopay, and all of them will intentionally overcharge you without notice at some point. And then it will take forever to get an account credit. Spectrum double billed me two months ago. If it had been on autopay, they would simply have taken both out without saying anything. Because I don't autopay, I called them and told them about the error. It took two weeks to resolve, but I wasn't out any money and they didn't charge late fees for their error."
131,"As someone who worked with AT&T and knows their billing ""unauthorized"" fees that they add, I can almost assuredly say there is more going on than randomly adding a fee. For instance, it's very likely that the OP had a price-lock guarantee for however long, and it is going to be running out. They raised the speeds without the price going up due to this contract, but they are now allowed once that contract is over to raise the fees.

Is it a shitty business practice? Yes. Is it illegal? No."
132,"Verizon jacked the rate of my grandfathered unlimited data up over $50/mo. I was already paying out the nose and could barely use my phone (very limited minutes/texts). That was it, I switched three lines to T-Mobile that month, sold my unlimited plan on eBay for $550, and have since pulled 4 more people away from Verizon onto my plan, with 4 more in the works at the moment. 

Fuck Verizon's greed. I went from paying $130 to Verizon for 2 lines, 400 shared minutes, 500 texts, and unlimited data on 1 line (no data on the other), to $120  on T-Mobile for 4 lines of unlimited talk/text, and 10gb of data each line plus whitelisted video and music streaming. "
133,"As someone that was worked over the phone and now in the store:

*All comments here are experience from working in 3 different local AT&T stores*

------------

The people in the store hate the people over the phone just as much as vice versa.  We don't have NEARLY the same training, nor access to as many systems, and follow different policy than call centers. Most stores have it set up where we do NOT tell the customers fees will be waived unless it is a proper credit. Telling customers their activation fees and upgrade fees will be waived by calling in will get you fired. It's far too easy for a customer to come right back to the store and return everything (the majority of customers do NOT care about the $45 restocking fee).

The vast majority of our customers are those in need of Tech-support, in which we can only do so much with the phone settings.  Again, there are SEVERAL systems we don't have access to.  

RST (the store support number) is also typically a 20min wait minimum, and with notating the account and having the issue resolved it takes roughly 40min.  

Your average call is ~12min.  If we have so many customers in the store that it's usually an hour to 2 hours before we can fully assess/help you for something simple, we cannot just stop helping a customer.  However, to lower traffic in the store, so we can spend more time building rapport and focusing on sales, we may direct customers to Customer Service while they wait.  If we know fully well what the customer wants to get done is possible and fully in their rights to do so but the rep refuses simply because they're standing in a store, that is now you no longer doing your job.  You can make sales over the phone when they're in the store.  I did it while i was over the phone, and reps still do it with customers in our store. 

tldr; it's a whole different world/environment in a store, and without  working in both fields you can't put someone else down for it. 

---- 

IMO selling over the phone was much easier than selling in store, because of the fact that they can come back to you in the store.  It's just the call centers have a tremendously higher requirement for commission. "
134,"Exactly. I worked in a call center for 3 months. It was 100% help desk stuff for T Mobile, but we worked for an entirely separate company. Terrible pay. Terrible environment. Huge turnover. They know the job is terrible and don't expect anyone to stay long unless they have no better options. "
135,"They already paid because AT&T threatened to sue him for a ton of fees in addition to the $1k owed on the account.  I believe AT&T said if they had to take it to court they would be seeking well over double the $1,000.  No lawyer here was willing to touch the case (small town) so he paid to avoid the legal trouble even though he couldn't afford it.  

Edit: First comment was worded badly.  He was on a family plan with her when she died.  He made a payment over the phone to keep his phone on.  It did not tell him that there was a balance when he made the payment, then AT&T said ""you made a payment, it's your account now.  pay up or we sue for double what we're asking""
"
136,"Speaking as an AT&T sales rep, AT&T was wrong here if it went down as you say. We are told to cancel the line/account of the deceased person and choose “deceased” as the reason, which waives any payments or fees due on that particular line or account. The only person financially responsible for the bill is the person who is the “Account Holder.” Even if you are an authorized user, it is not your social security number and you are not responsible for the bill in any way. 

If you want to be a good guy and pay for the phone purchased, you can always transfer the billing responsibility of the line to yourself and take over the payments. Otherwise, don’t pay that bill. 

It’s actually one of my favorite things about AT&T. They don’t hold you responsible for the debt of the account holder. My options when you come in are to cancel the lines and pick “deceased” as the reason, or transfer billing responsibility to someone else. 

It sounds like he either didn’t cancel the account, or the sales rep didn’t click “deceased “ as the reason. "
137,"Fun little tip, if you are in collections for something with a major company like AT&T, once it gets to the second collection, go ahead and offer to pay them 1/20th or less of the actual amount of the bill. Most collection agencies (not pre-collection, but once it gets out of precollection) will go ahead and do it, because they buy those debts for pennies on the dollar. "
138,"AT&T likely sold the debt to an unethical debt collector, or had a contract to service the debt with an unethical servicer. Either way, fuck AT&T."
139,"It literally doesn't cost Verizon and AT&T a penny to have wireless subscribers use Wifi Tethering, but they've charged extra for years to enable that as a feature on your phone. 

On top of that, on the few occasions where I was running a rooted phone with a custom image, I often used tethering with no ill effects and nothing additional on my bill. All it is is just extra data passing through the same channels, yet they insist it's an extra ""chargeable feature"" that the phone gods need to bless your device with.

We're all being robbed, during the daylight at that."
140,"Have you checked to make sure the modem is plugged in?

145,"I've resolved this since then, but back in December I had a fraudulent iphone ordered on my AT&T account. Seemed like it was happening to a lot of people and all during the same time frame.

It shipped the SAME day it was ordered. I swung by AT&T right after work and they couldn't get through the fraud line and I couldn't. The phone reps couldn't help. Even when I told them the shipment was intercepted and phone was returned, no one could help. I was on hold for fraud for over six hours. After assuring me it was taken care of, I STILL got charged for the phone. It took two months to get it settled.

Who would I have filed a complaint with?"
146,"My mom is an elderly lady, she went over her 1gb of data with her ipad while we were on a trip to Mexico.  Her ipad notified her, but she doesnt understand the notifications.  So she brings it to me and we call AT&T.  A man explains to us that she has charged over 400$ of international data charges, however if she upped her plan for a short fee for at least one month, he would waive the overages and she could continue to use her data.  We asked him over and over on speakerphone, are you sure the fees will be waived???   Fast forward to the next bill and my mother was charged for everything (over 600 in overages) and everything that person told her was ""misinformation""...  

Any advice?"
147,My dad passed away a few years ago when I was still a teenager & I didn’t really know how to handle much of the finances and billing and stuff.. my mom has been getting ripped off by T-mobile... I’ve had to have them explain her bill to me so many times... they were billing us twice because when I tried to get it sorted out we found that we had two family plans and they were charging for both accounts. They did not refund us and they gave us a hard time about merging the accounts. They just cancelled the grandfathered account and made a new one :( I didn’t know what to do and so we just ate the cost.. we always do. Same thing with comcast... the heating company.. our bank Wells Fargo... doctors... so so many issues with doctors and insurance not covering medicine it was supposed to due to a mistake made on their end. I can’t even get the hospital to give me my medical records from the surgery I had last year.. I wish I had more knowledge of these sorts of resources.. in the face of grief and entering adulthood I became so overwhelmed.. it’s been so hard and it feels like I have no one to turn to.
148,"So I signed up in November with T-Mobile, they were running a BOGO special on iPhones, basically the way it works is you sign a lease for both phones and wait 6 weeks for a Visa Gift Card. Do to the store manager not handling the account correctly my cards never got processed. (I bought 4 phones) I didn’t realize until a little after the 6 weeks when the gift cards never came. Went into the store and they said they’d take care of it and I’d have to wait another 6 weeks. I decided people make mistakes and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Again no cards, contact the manager who ignores my calls and messages. Contact corporate find out that when the manager ignored me and didn’t reply to my messages that he instead finally put the request in but only for one card. They apology say they’ll take care of it expedite the 2 cards. I check the mail Friday, only 1 card, login to my account, the other card was denied. So now it’s April, 5 months after signing up and I still haven’t been reimbursed for the phones. Not to mention during all that the manager was horribly rude to me and continually avoided me, and customer service told me I missed the BOGO and they couldn’t give me the cards, that I’d have to take in store credit. I argued that and they finally agreed to send the cards. I’m not sure on what I should do? Continue to wait for the cards? I explained to T-Mobile that they put a financial strain on my family because we had only budgeted for leasing 2 phones, the most they offered was an extra 30 dollar credit. I realize I’ll get my money back when the cards come in but it doesn’t account for the unneeded stress that I didn’t account for. Any advice? Sorry so long"
149,"Last month our overall bill for cable, internet, and TV (all through Spectrum) went up $20 dollars.  Upon calling them, we were told that our plan was no longer offered.  Now we are paying just over 200/month for that package.  Its unbelievable.  That's a lot of money and I've already reached out to Google Fiber (who is about 20 miles away and can't comment on when the service will be available).  AT&T also just put in fiber lines last week but let's be real, nobody really wants them either.

Anyways, does anyone know if I'd be able to get something done?  I feel like their fine print would say something along the lines of ""Charges are subject to change at any time without notice.""  Its disgusting how much these companies can charge, be rude, and generally just not give a shit all because they are a monopoly in certain cities....looking at you Comcast and Spectrum!"
150,"damn, probably too late now, but unfortunately had a problem with AT&T 2 years ago where the sales rep said I would be getting a 3D camera and a camera attachement with my phone for free, I told him I didn't really want it. He said it was free and I asked him very clearly ""Its free as in, I will not have to pay anything on the bill for it"" and he said ""Yes its free"" and bam next month  there is a 30$ charge for the items.

We returned to the store after we got the bill and talked to the manager in that store and he basically called me stupid (His exact words ""Of course its not free, why would you think that"") 

So just an FYI for everyone, if you have AT&T, and they offer you something, even though they say its free it probably isn't, so just say no. They get paid a part of the sales, so when they lie they get paid more.  

Phones almost paid off, can't wait to get off this shitty plan, AT&T is awful, I know I sound like a whiny customer, but we've had a plan with them for 13 years. Its insane how we would just get dicked like that. As a company they should do better when hiring the people who we see as the face of their company. "
151,"My gf was charged by AT&T 3 months after she terminated her service and paid her final bill.  They sent her bill to collections. Can she still file a complaint that somehow remove or lower the collections bill?

Update: Gf filed a complaint yesterday, today she received a call from AT&T regional director. "
152,"I Am usually a lurker on reddit and this is actually my second post or comment. Anyway...

I have been fighting with AT&T for literally months. I signed up for their internet service after being lied to over the phone, and then proceeded to cancel before 30 days once I realized the lie. I have contact AT&T in every way possible because even though I cancelled within the given time frame they charged me $125. At first I flat out refused to pay because I was sure I didn't owe it. Then AT&T sent me to collections, so I paid the money in the interest of saving my credit. 

Fast forward till yesterday, like I said I have contacted them by email, snail mail, called and went to the store. Submitted multiple ""Tickets"" that should take 10-14 business days to hear back from and just never did. Well anyway yesterday as I was doing my morning Reddit lurk I saw this post and said what the hell, it can't hurt the situation, and sent in a claim to the FCC. **It took less than 24 hours to get this resolved after I submitted a ticket with the FCC**. FVCKING FANTASTIC. Couldn't be happier. 

Guy from AT&T said that ""I looked through your file and because you did cancel within the 30 days then of course you were within the 30 day money back guarantee, so of course you get your money back."" I hate this company. Took 6 months to get them to adhere to policy. 

THANK YOU @Listenlindalinda you saved me $125

153,"So I just happened to see this post while on my wife’s safari browser when I was logged out of my account. I think it saved me $81. I’ve been in a battle with AT&T trying to get my directv account unified with them, and in all that mess, I was double charged for internet one month. Last month we sorted it out, they were going to credit me for this month, and it never materialized. I went to the store yesterday, we called AT&T customer service, but they couldn’t find a record of my call last month, nor could they see the double charge, so they said they couldn’t help. I was red hot mad after that, so I used your FCC complaint link last night. I’ll be damned if I didn’t get an $81 credit on my account TODAY and a freaking call from someone who said “I’m with AT&T office of the president.” Maybe it was a coincidence...but I highly doubt it. I’m truly impressed this worked!"
154,"Holy shit, doing this just got me cleared of an AT&T acct that has been sitting in collections for several years! 

I tried to set up internet with AT&T, but it turned out they didn't provide service to my address (somehow only found this out after they established my acct). Got everything cancelled but I was still receiving bills. I had to call every couple of months for almost a year after all this to clear things up after I'd receive another bill.  I thought everything was good after not hearing anything for a few years

Then out of nowhere I had an acct in collections show up on my credit report. I tried everything thru the credit bureaus to get it removed, but they just kept saying it was a valid collections acct and wouldn't remove it. That has been the only negative thing on my credit report, so it was very frustrating to have this on there when it never should've shown up in the first place. I kinda gave up trying to get it cleared after awhile because I didn't know what else to do. 

I came across this post the day it made the front page and filed a report. Here we are four days later, and it's already been taken care of (turns out it was an ETF that I shouldn't have been charged). It should be removed from my credit report shortly as well. Amazing! And thank you u/listenlindalinda so much for this post!!"
155,"Read this post the other day and followed the link for cell phones. Complained about my international data charge of $114 for .01GB of data that was used when I forgot to put my phone on airplane mode for an hour into the flight.

Complained to the fcc three days ago and got a call yesterday that they are refunding my account the full $114. Hell yeah, thank you!"
156,I just wanted to show my appreciation for posting this! Without your post I would of never had gotten my money back from AT&T.

I know your post probably has helped thousands of people get things right by these companies that just want to rip us off! Thank you thank you thank you!!

Then COVID came and I lost my job and didn't see a penny from the gubment, while I lost pretty much everything but my truck and my investments, which I was getting close to having to pull. I always did everything right, and when I needed help, the one time I asked the world to help, I got fuck all. Meanwhile a bunch of dipshits got rich off our despair, fuggum'.

167,"It's the banking world's dirty secret ever since 1907 when JP Morgan (the man not the bank) had to bail out the US government. Shorting, volume and supply can cause catastrophic results especially if everyone decides fuck this I am taking my cash out the banking system. Look at this from wiki - sounds familiar:

Augustus' brother, Otto, devised the scheme to corner United Copper, believing that the Heinze family already controlled a majority of the company. He also believed that a significant number of the Heinze's shares had been borrowed, and sold short, by speculators betting that the stock price would drop, and that they could thus repurchase the borrowed shares cheaply, pocketing the difference. Otto proposed a short squeeze, in which the Heinzes would aggressively purchase as many remaining shares as possible, and then force the short sellers to pay for their borrowed shares. The aggressive purchasing would drive up the share price, and, being unable to find shares elsewhere, the short sellers would have no option but to turn to the Heinzes, who could then name their price.[19]
To finance the scheme, Otto, Augustus and Charles Morse met with Charles T. Barney, president of the city's third-largest trust, the Knickerbocker Trust Company. Barney had provided financing for previous Morse schemes. Morse, however, cautioned Otto that in order to attempt the squeeze, Otto needed much more money than Barney had, and Barney declined to provide funding.[20] Otto decided to attempt the corner anyway. On Monday, October 14, he began aggressively purchasing shares of United Copper, which rose in one day from $39 to $52 per share. On Tuesday (Oct. 15), he issued the call for short sellers to return the borrowed stock. The share price rose to nearly $60, but the short sellers were able to find plenty of United Copper shares from sources other than the Heinzes. Otto had misread the market, and the share price of United Copper began to collapse.[21]
The stock closed at $30 on Tuesday and fell to $10 by Wednesday (Oct. 16). Otto Heinze was ruined. The stock of United Copper was traded outside the hall of the New York Stock Exchange, literally an outdoor market ""on the curb"" (this curb market would later become the American Stock Exchange). After the crash, The Wall Street Journal reported, ""Never has there been such wild scenes on the Curb, so say the oldest veterans of the outside market"".[22]

Contagion spreadsEdit

The failure of the corner left Otto unable to meet his obligations and sent his brokerage house, Gross & Kleeberg, into bankruptcy. On Thursday, October 17, the New York Stock Exchange suspended Otto's trading privileges. As a result of United Copper's collapse, the State Savings Bank of Butte Montana (owned by F. Augustus Heinze) announced its insolvency. The Montana bank had held United Copper stock as collateral against some of its lending and had been a correspondent bank for the Mercantile National Bank in New York City, of which F. Augustus Heinze was then president.
F. Augustus Heinze's association with the corner and the insolvent State Savings Bank proved too much for the board of the Mercantile to accept. Although they forced him to resign before lunch time,[23] by then it was too late. As news of the collapse spread, depositors rushed en masse to withdraw money from the Mercantile National Bank. The Mercantile had enough capital to withstand a few days of withdrawals, but depositors began to pull cash from the banks of the Heinzes' associate Charles W. Morse. Runs occurred at Morse's National Bank of North America and the New Amsterdam National. Afraid of the impact the tainted reputations of Augustus Heinze and Morse could have on the banking system, the New York Clearing House (a consortium of the city's banks) forced Morse and Heinze to resign all banking interests.[24] By the weekend after the failed corner, there was not yet systemic panic. Funds were withdrawn from Heinze-associated banks, only to be deposited with other banks in the city.[25]
A week later many regional stock exchanges throughout the nation were closing or limiting trading. For example, the Pittsburgh city's stock exchange closed for three months starting on October 23, 1907"

If Reddit bans all alt-right stuff, the alt-right people will all leave.  And 90% of Reddit won't miss them.  

If Reddit bans all porn, that'll suck, but people will stay with Reddit for everything else.  Unlike Tumblr, there are good reasons to stay with Reddit.  

So the new site or message board has alt-right and porn.  Great.  You don't.  How do you attract advertisers to a site full of alt-right and porn?  You don't, except for advertisers that cater to alt-right groups and porn users.  Great, now your site has alt-right and porn ads as well as alt-right and porn content.  
Now how do you persuade users of a totally non-controversial group, like for example /r/Cats or /r/AskScience, that AREN'T so much about 'internet culture', to move to a site that's full of alt-right and porn?  You don't, because they won't move, no matter how awesome your site is.

188,"quick explanation for AMC:

The hedge funds sold call options on AMC up to $9. If the price closes above 9 today, those options will get exercised and the hedge funds will be on the hook to provide 100 AMC shares for each option contract sold. Therefore they will have to buy back at market prices to provide those shares.

this will compound the upward price movement (called a gamma squeeze). The higher AMC closes today, the larger the positive effect. Additionally, short interest on AMC has gone up 13% this week (71% -> 84%) meaning they are doubling down on their short. If we can gamma squeeze today (keep price above 9), then the short squeeze will soon follow.

What will likely cause the first blink is the exercising of call options later today.  This will inevitably trigger profit taking by paper handed fucks, lurkers, haters, and those who don’t understand what they’re a part of in the context of history and social impact.

The owner's plan was to just use a third party service for any IT needs. My friend was escorted immediately out of the building by security after he grabbed his belongings.

Within 48 hours of him being terminated they are having countless computer issues already. The owner didn't know any of the passwords. The owner had no idea the scope of custom software in place. The third party I.T. company sent someone out and quoted the job at over 300,000 to update everything and get all the databases integrated into the new software.

I'm 49 with a decent amount of experience in stock (nowhere near levels that I'd ever give advice past what I give here). 

Do not leverage yourself. Not just ""don't borrow for this"". Never borrow for stock if that borrowing takes you below your net worth. And by net worth, if you own your home, DON'T include that in your calculations. Never borrow for stock if your net worth is already negative. Never borrow for stock if you don't already have your safety net. 

""Borrow"" doesn't just mean taking out loans to buy stock (please don't do that), *it includes buying on margin*. If you margin buy past your net value it can destroy you. 

Yes, I'll be buying that stock on Monday at higher prices. But not on margin and with money I've long since decided to treat as if the money isn't there for my daily life. 

I might well lose everything I spend tomorrow and it wouldn't change anything about my life. If you put money into a venture for trading profit (which is different from long term investment) then, if you get burned, that burn will *hurt*.

Finally got fed up and shopped myself around.  Got an offer with an 18% pay increase.  Told my boss about it and was given all the reasons why leaving would be bad for my career, but no offer.  Came in the next day and turned in my notice.  That afternoon I got a 13% pay increase offer to stay.  Ended up taking it for various reasons.

245,"Here's my theory, not financial advice.

When the short positions expired last Friday, the shorts were removed from ""short interest volume"". Pair that with the massive sell off we saw in major stocks (likely hedge funds selling to cover their position) may explain why such a large portion of short interest disappeared. 

The remainder of the short positions will now need be be fulfilled within T+3 days marking tomorrow. Also if you look at the SEC rules on failure-to-deliver, those need to be delivered within T+4 days which is Thursday. (*Rule 204 – Close-out Requirement -* [*https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm*](https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm)*)*

I think we'll know whether the shorts covered their position or not by Thursday/Friday.

I think the biggest risk is that retail investors have probably been selling off their GME on Monday and Tuesday only further helping shorts cover their position at lower costs.

The question is, is the demand higher than the supply going into Wednesday and Thursday?

I think there are positions that need to be covered still and if retail investors kept their positions high then they could succeed in the squeeze."
246,"These are the same shares traded back and forth.  But it doesn't have to be short sellers.  In fact, it's the whole fucking point of market makers.  They are ""making"" the market.  They are what guarantee that most of the time the bid/ask spread on stocks are at historical lows.  And, yes, they may end up talking to each other, but that volume generally relates to liquidity which is useful to all market participants.

The stock is not dropping b/c of ""short ladder"" attacks.  If there were buyers, they would buy up the other side, and the attack would be useless.  If there were buyers, the stock couldn't be driven down without matching short volume.

The blame for this situation lies squarely with DTC who protected the short sellers, period.  They didn't even need to be evil, they just had to be self-interested.  The short side was going to blow up, so they tipped the scales in the short's favor.  As a monopolistic entity, they had RH by the balls, and negotiated their required deposit down by $1B, along with an *agreement to limit the net volume of $GME buys* over some period of time, likely until the end of this week.

Why do I suspect this last part?  Because of the way RH is controlling $GME volume by tuning their limitations ""5, 2, 1, 2, 5, 20, 100"" with the latter increase coming as $GME decreased drastically in price (so that it corresponds to roughly the same amount of dollars).  Tues/Wed of last week saw epic buy-side $GME volume on RH, but after a substantial cash raise, RH should be in a position not to be dicked around anymore.  And yet the limitations are still present.

DTC's calculations didn't make sense from the start, as RH's supposed deposit requirements jumped by 10x.  DTC claims they needed to ensure that RH deposits covered the net (buy volume - sell volume) over the T+2 settlement period with 99% probability.  Supposedly this required a 10x increase in RH's deposit.  That's not due only to volume, that's due to an increased volatility estimate (i.e., the estimated variance of the net buy volume was much larger).  In other words, the 99% safety margins needed to be much beefier.

But this is an insane way to measure the net buy volume volatility, as RH simply can't keep buying without their users depositing massive equity.  Most of that buying is going to come from selling other securities, meaning that the net buy volume in a given day was likely to decrease.  There is a negative feedback effect because two days after Tues/Wed, the deposits are cleared, and all that equity is then sitting in $GME, unable to be used to keep moving the daily net buy volume.

DTC knows this.  But even this simple mathematical argument is too complex for a jury or a congressional hearing to follow, so they can refer to them as ""risk management measures"" and avoid admitting that they actively manipulated the market in their own self interest."

285,"I love how everyone here seems to believe that hedge fund managers and investors are completely unaware of the performance of index funds for the last 40 years.

When the 10-year bet was made, we were entering an extremely turbulent time. Everyone in the industry knew this. People on the inside especially knew that the housing market was collapsing and a lot of banks could fail. Hedge funds are about realizing alpha rather than maximizing beta, and in that respect it was one of the best times ever to make a bet that hedge funds would outperform the market. It didn't turn out that way, obviously, but we might be having a very different conversation if the Fed had bungled the bailout and Citi, Bank of America, JPMorgan, etc. had all gone under. No one could have foreseen how the crisis was going to play out beforehand.

Hedge funds exist to preserve capital, not to maximize returns. If you want to do better than 10-year T-bonds but you can't afford to lose 50% of your capital in a Black Swan crisis, you go with a hedge fund. Pension funds, banks, insurance companies, college endowments, and sovereign wealth funds all fall into this category. Imagine if Harvard had it's $30+ billion endowment just in S&P funds and the market tanked 50% next year. They want to avoid that, for obvious reasons."

289,"Similar thing happened to me.  My AT&T credentials were stolen in the Yahoo! hack.  Someone signed me up for hundreds of mailing lists, then placed an order for an iPhone and asked for it to be shipped to a different address.  I was lucky...I WFH so when the emails started coming in, they were in relatively small batches and I spotted the AT&T email confirmation right away.  I called them and cancelled the order, then added some extra security.

All of the hacks I've had over the years:

1. My World of Warcraft account was compromised years ago, but that was pretty easy to resolve.
2. Someone used my PSN account to buy games for a PS Vita overseas.  Easily corrected with a phone call.
3. Credit card info stolen somehow and used for fraudulent purchases in California.  This one was really annoying because I had to get new CCs.
4. Amazon account broken into, someone added themselves as an ""authorized user"" and ordered some stuff.  Again, easily corrected by calling Amazon.
5. AT&T hack described above."
290,"My AT&T account was broken into this way on about 2 years ago. We were sitting at breakfast one morning and my phone goes haywire. I got roughly 1500 emails in about 2 hours. They tried to hide an email saying they had added 5 new lines to my account billed the phones to my account.  Fortunately, AT&T also sends a text confirmation which helped me know what to look for."

292,"Even then, unless he intended to pull the entire balance of his retirement savings upon retirement or only plans to live for a few years after retiring, IT DOESN'T MATTER."
293,"That's a pretty bad article...  

>Retirement Savings Goals  
>  
>What should you aim for, savings-wise? **Fidelity has some pretty concrete ideas. By the time you’re 30, the company calculates you should have saved half of your annual salary.** If you are earning $50,000 by age 30, you should have $25,000 banked for [retirement](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/retirement.asp). By age 40, you should have twice your annual salary. By age 50, four times your salary; by age 60, six times, and by age 67, eight times. If you reach 67 years old and are earning $75,000 per year, you should have $600,000 saved.

No... fidelity is the one saying 1x your salary.  People can disagree with the amounts.  Sure, that's subjective, but you can't ***cite*** fidelity and then make up *their* numbers.

 [How much do I need to retire?](https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/retirement/how-much-do-i-need-to-retire) 

>Key takeaways

>**Fidelity's rule of thumb: Aim to save at least 1x your salary by 30**, 3x by 40, 6x by 50, 8x by 60, and 10x by 67.  
>  
>Factors that will impact your personal savings goal include the age you plan to retire and the lifestyle you hope to have in retirement.

>If you're behind, don't fret. There are ways to catch up. The key is to take action.

If you want the guideline saying 1/2 your salary, that would be  [T. Rowe Price](https://www.troweprice.com/personal-investing/planning-and-research/t-rowe-price-insights/retirement-and-planning/retirement-savings/are-you-on-track-for-a-successful-retirement-.html)

Just about everyone references the fidelity numbers though(I could give you a dozen links saying 30 = 1x salary).

The reality is that it's simply a rule of thumb guideline and both of them fall apart for individuals, but work well when applied to the population as a whole."
294,"I've got some AT&T as well set up to compound the dividends into more shares. The AMD and NVIDIA shares were just extra money I could afford to risk. Basically a little over 20% of my paychecks go directly into a savings account, from there about 15% gets automatically distributed into an IRA and another mutual fund. What's left is used to make sure my credit card can be zeroed out. Then around the end of the year I put what's left into the IRA and/or consider putting it into some more stock."
295,Did not follow this advice and we are still attempting to get ourselves out of the financial repercussions!  DON'T BUY WHAT YOU CAN'T AFFORD!
296,"Good point. I would add a bit of advice also: 1. If you don't like doing ""yard work, DON'T BUY A HOUSE WITH A YARD. You can destroy the resale value of your home and your neighbors' homes by letting the outside fall apart. Don't buy more home than you are willing and able to clean and maintain, inside and out."

it's weird to keep running into these cases where companies have scammed other people who aren't me out of their money.

298,"And here in Las Vegas, at least one of the cab companies don't care if their drivers run red lights and come within a few feet of causing a t-bone crash. This happened to me a couple of months ago. I had the green and hestitated a moment as I usually do before moving into the intersection. Damn glad I did, as this cab goes screaming across the intersection maybe 2-3 feet in front of me. Had I not hestitated before entering the intersection, this imbecile would have t-boned me. I took off after him and got the cab number and company. Later after I cooled down I called them... Guess what their response was when I told them what happened.... ""WE DON'T CARE... unless there is actually an accident, we don't care""... I asked the person, ""I wonder if the police and news media will care when I call them?""... The guy hung up. Of course the police said they can't do anything unless an officer sees it happen, and the tv station I called, simply said ""yeah... happens all the time, nothing new"".... yikes!!"
299,"Yep. Fuck taxi businesses and fuck taxi drivers. As someone who's traveled a lot, the amount of bullshit they pull is unreal. Lying about distance, lying about bus times, lying about safety of other means of getting somewhere, changing the cost after the trip, not running the meter, hiding the meter, running the meter up intentionally by taking a longer route, pretending they don't have change and therefore you should just pay the difference, rejecting rides because of destination, upcharging tourists for a trip that locals have said has a standard price. Literally I've experienced each and every one of these personally, and this as someone who takes cabs as a last resort. F-U-C-K T-A-X-I-S."
300,"public transportation is dick where i am, and you're gonna find that in a lot of midwestern cities.  we're too sprawled out.  to and from work where i live would be a 45 minute bus ride and would dump me a mile from where i am.  our public transport is fine for very general parts of the city, but we aren't a municipality that has the means or the inclination to add a subway or rail.

biking is an option, since the trails do connect the major parts of the city, but you are talking sprawl to a massive degree here.  there's a huge difference in time getting places versus having a car.

in addition to that, buying a car isn't an investment, but it does secure safe and easy means of transport.  i don't want to wait 30 minutes for a bus when i could be there already.  in addition to that, the walk to my destination from the stop, grocery shopping, etc, is just handled better by cars--plus the busses stop running around 10 pm, so you have to plan around it.

having a family would be nigh impossible also.  between daycare and work hours, you're looking at an entire wasted day because you can't just go point A to point B directly.

i've no doubts that it can and does happen, but not having a car simply ISN'T economical for most people in cities that aren't major hubs or metropolises.

student debt is crippling people's futures.  cars have nothing to do with it."
301,"Never said 90% was a statistic, it's just a generalization. 

I've been commuting on my motorcycle for 5 years, doing track days, race days, extra rider training in that time & of all the crashes I've heard of, most of them are the riders fault. 

I can picture one crash that *wasn't* the riders fault and he couldn't do anything. A bloke in an oncoming car had a heart attack while driving and suddenly hit the motorcyclist head on. He was luckily mostly fine except a fractured clavicle.

Yes, the risks on a motorcycle are more severe for consequences, but the fact is - risks considered, it comes down to the mentality of the rider. 

I've had several crashes, both on track & on road. I've ended up under a car and walked away without a scratch and just a bit of whiplash for a week. I've come off doing a wheelie at 146km/h and got road rash. I've come off doing 160km/h in a race trying to overtake and I ran out of tyre.  

I have taken responsibility for each of the crashes as mistakes I've made and use them to improve. 

Riders who end up as statistics are the ones who deny that there was anything they could've done and go out and make the same mistakes again. The mentality that ""It's not my fault, she cut me off"" makes the rider believe there is nothing they could've done. maybe instead of ""It's not my fault, she cut me off"" it could be seen as ""I was in her blind spot"" or if at a T-intersection you could say ""This car might pull out in front of me.. Let me adjust my road position so they can see me & prepare to stop if they pull out anyway"". 

Simple things like being able to slalom properly, efficiently and quickly to avoid hitting something is a skill many riders fail to remember in an emergency. I've seen videos of easily avoidable accidents on YouTube that riders would prefer to attempt to brake, rather than ride around. "
302,"When my grandparents moved out of their family home to a single floor condo, my mom had to call the phone company to figure out how to return the phones they had been renting, RENTING, since AT&T was **Bell Fucking Atlantic.**

The girl at customer service was so confused, she had to ask her supervisor, who laughed, and finally just said to keep them or throw them out.

Mind you, this is a Yale-educated man who, at one point, was solely responsible for purchasing all the fuel required to power the entire DC metropolitan area."
303,"I just found out yesterday that my mom was paying $15/mo for 6 gigs of data on my grandma's 15 year old FLIP PHONE. That's more data than my phone gets and hers can't even access the Internet!

I called T-mobile and I was able to get 3 months credited. I fought for the entire 8 months, but they wouldn't budge after they went from 2-3. Good luck with your dad and the AOL bill, OP! And lesson learned for me - audit your statements every once in a while!"
304,"My dad died renting two AT&T rotary phones he hadn't used in 20 years. I called AT&T to cancel, and they actually sent me two big envelopes to ship the pieces of shit back to them. Unbelievable."
305,"My grandparents had two accounts with AT&T because they were moved over to the new U-Verse service but the tech didn't shut off their old account with DSL service. (This was a forced transition)

Anyway, they paid for that DSL service for over a year, totalling $1400. After getting the runaround from their telephone support, I went directly to the FCC and immediately got a call from the executives and received a check for the full amount. "
306,"Something similar happened to me with AT&T. I was paying for parental controls about $9.99 a month for over a year. I cancelled it via a phone call when I changed the service a year ago, and they kept it on the bill. They offered to pay me back for 3 months and I told them it was fraud because I specifically cancelled that service. They ended up refunding the full charges. Perhaps if you can check with your dad to see if he did cancel, and there could be a case made for fraud if they kept billing him. "
307,"I'm not sure what state you are in but I was able to convince AT&T to refund 6 months of payments. I upgraded to Uverse and changed credit cards from my wife's card to mine. Well, AT&T kept charging the old card for DSL, even though we canceled. 

Since it was on 2 cards and we each check one of them, we didn't discover the issue for 2 years. 

The CC company did nothing but after some escalation, AT&T sent a refund for 6 months of the 2 years. This was based on consumer law in Texas but I can't seem to find where I got the basis for the 6 months anymore. Basically, beyond 6 months, Texas considers it the responsibility of the consumer to notify the vendor of the issue. "
308,"One of those is my mother. I've had countless arguments with her trying to cancel her dial-up, as she's had AT&T High Speed internet for several years. 

She says she she's paying the thirty some odd dollars a month to use her email. I can't get it across to her that most email is free, including her aol email. 

At least I got her to finally cancel her cable and just use my Netflix. "
309,"Actually, they had probably been renting the phones since Bell Atlantic was AT&T the first time around (AT&T got broken up into Bell Atlantic, SBC, BellSouth, etc in 1984 and has slowly reassembled itself out of about half of it's former companies. Verizon is made up of the other half)"
310,"Don't let them mess up your credit for no reason. AT&T did the same thing to me. Kept sending me bills for a cable box they said I had. Every month I'd call and they'd assure me it was taken care of. This went on for months and eventually I got a collections call for the account. I had to call AT&T and scream at several people, but they finally fixed it for real. I try to be overly nice to customer service people usually, but at some point enough is enough. "
311,"And depending upon what your time is worth. 2 months times 30 bucks might not be worth it. 

Once I started making considerable amounts of money. I stopped calling Sprint and AT&T for that whopping $5 per month discount. 

It just wasn't worth all the threatening to cancel. In fact I called and threatened to cancel one day and they said ""aright cool just put the order through"" before I could say ""wait no nevermind"". 

Internet was out for a week while they hooked me back up. 

So I urge everyone here to ask yourself what your time is worth, what you are getting. And if the effort and stress is worth it. I'm not saying stop. I'm just saying that constantly fighting with companies over a few bucks really gets exhausting at times. "
312,"I live in Tennessee, not far from the fires.









There aren't many options for internet and utilities out here. Where I am, there's only one utility company, so they treat *everyone* like shit because there's nowhere else for them to go.









Your internet options are either AT&T or Charter. Charter's internet is dirt cheap ($30/mo no contract) but holy fuck is their service worthless, and I've yet to meet an employee who wasn't a braindead bumpkin with no manners."
313,"Yeah, you really shouldn't be allowed to scare people about a 'scam' when the real issue is that u/underwater_grilling didn't actually **read what he was agreeing to** when signing up for a credit card.

It's equivalent to

>WARNING! YOUR CREDIT CARD IS SCAMMING YOU! IF YOU DON'T PAY IT OFF IN FULL THEY CHARGE SOMETHING CALLED ""INTEREST"". I DID NOT AGREE TO INTEREST."
314,"I called to threaten to cancel and they basically know the only other option here is a capped AT&T plan with worse speeds for higher prices so they basically said ""okay, cancel then."""
315,"Similar situation for me years ago, and something to consider: in 1999 I was laid off from my job. I was managing the company's telecommunications, voice and data (two very separate things in that year), and they felt I was an extravagance. I warned them they were probably going to get ""slammed."" Back then if your long distance calling plan wasn't airtight you could be saddled with a plan that would increase per-minute calling from $.03 or so per minute to $5.00 per minute. MCI, AT&T, Sprint, all long distance providers did this.

They thought I was trying to save my job, waved it off, and let me go. No severance. 

About two months passed before they invited me back to discuss their phone bills, which they felt I was responsible for. Seems they totalled somewhere in the neighborhood of $2MM, when they had been $25-$30K. I reminded then they were told to watch their billing because slamming was so prevalent and we hung up. Later in the day their attorney contacted me and said they got it, they did know, it was in writing, but what was I going to do about it. I responded there was nothing I could do about it, as I was not their employee.

Same thing as OP - they offered me $20/hr. and a full time gig.

I countered with a 6 week contract, JUST reversing the billing and overseeing the refunds, no guarantee I would be 100% successful.

I started my negotiations at $250 an hour, 8 hour days, 30 days of work over 6 weeks. Days of negotiations were almost inevitable.

They bit. I showed up the next day, signed paperwork, and went to work. Just a tick south of $2.00 per minute. Negotiating the refund with MCI was not difficult but all the billing (which was on paper) had to be reviewed and authenticated, a little tedious, but I had a team of 2 people from Finance to help me. After 6 weeks (that last week was a realllllly easy one) I handed over the paper trail that showed they got all their money back, and was ready to leave. They balked ($60K was a big-ass check) because I hadn't built a prevention plan, but that wasn't in the contract. I was handed my check and left.

This is not a ""I was a badass"" story: I didn't walk out the door to thunderous applause, and even though I bragged about it for a while I learned since then that I was *incredibly* lucky, given I had never been a contractor before. I wasn't aware that it wasn't a hard thing to ask for $250/hr. when there were a few million at stake. The $250 number came out of thin air. I might have made more. I could have negotiated a percentage. I only got $100/hr. to come back for 2 weeks and build a position paper for a gal they hired to mange their telecom.

That story was waaay to long. TL;DR - consider what you were doing before you set your price."
316,"This is called T&M with a fixed budget. And it’s essentially how all government projects are funded. (Cost+) It’s shady and the most dishonest type of work possible as the contracting companies always want a re-up during the rebid phase and never want the project to actually be done. I’ve been told to slow down before. Quite literally. It’s horrible. 

There’s really Time and Materials (think house renovation.) then there is Fixed-bid (Think eating at a restaurant. You know the price of the food and you order. The price of the steak doesn’t change depending on how fast they got the steak to you.) "

0,"‚ÄúGood morning, I‚Äôve lost a lot of money because of Robinhood, because of their using unethical routes to manipulate the market. They said they‚Äôre stopping people from buying volatile stocks. What it‚Äôs really saying is, it‚Äôs stopping the poor for the chance to steal from the rich. I live in Hawaii, so the market opens incredibly open for me, so I had to wake up with 3 hours in down 56%. Robinhood cannot stop people from buying, because of volitility.  If that‚Äôs gonna be the case, what‚Äôs next? Are they going to stop us from buying $TSLA because it‚Äôs doubling in price when full selfing driving is out? And say it‚Äôs too volatile? There needs to be rules. I‚Äôm furious and there needs to be consequences to Robinhoods actions. ‚Äú"
1,Which is what every real broker does. Keeps people from pressing the F button on their life because they sold naked calls on TSLA by accident.

3,"Less useful, at least anal cysts let you know something's wrong. If the financial newsfeed during 2020 crash and TSLA boom didnt already make it clear, most published analysts have no idea what goes on in the hot movers of the market. They're throwing darts at a chart half the time."
4,"You can hold GME and buy silver.  Lol.

Is this r/wallstbets or is just a GME pump? I was part of the silver gang from last year and there was room here for SLV and TSLA and tons of other retarded ideas.

Regarding the squeeze it can absolutely happen.  Go on jmbullion or apmex.  They have no supply for sale anywhere near current spot price.  Go down to your local  pawn store.  I went to mine this weekend, not to buy but rather to see if there were people in line... guess what... line was around the corner.

It‚Äôs a run on physical boys.

Hold your GME as long as you want but don‚Äôt try to act like silver can‚Äôt squeeze.  It‚Äôs done so many times.  I was alive when it went from 2-50 in about three months.  Today with paper trading it has the potential to short term spike much higher.

Ride the silver wave.  Hold your GME.  These aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive options."
5,"If ELON were to throw a billion dollars at this and blow the share price out of the water, all of us would obviously go buy Model 3s or Ys and then pump his delivieries even higher and thus pumping TSLA stonk even higher and thus making ELON even richer! It can't go tits up! Plz ELON."
6,"since when was the stock market about actual worth...See also: TSLA

Well Said!!!"
7,"Dude I think you just outsmarted any large priced stocks. You can literally do this with TSLA right now. Buy the feb 5th $200 call, exercise and you end up getting TSLA for about $3/share cheaper than by buying it directly..."
8,#if you guys want an untouchable meme stock look nowhere further $TSLA
9,"This. My ETFs / TSLA / and a few large & small company‚Äôs ballooned my $2k to $5k in 6 months. I bought fractional share at $325, because why not and a share at $60. That‚Äôs my gambling. Holding on to my 1.77 shares because diamond hand ü§ö üíé"

13,"Nah, 1ronyman was in in November 2019 iirc and MSFT was in January/February after the TSLA 700C (iirc) actually fucking worked."
14,"$TSLA vehicles, solar panels, and accessories. Also German Defense industries."
15,"So I did a quick digging in on my own to support the authors claim. These data are all publicly available on the [SEC website](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm), what I simply did was to aggregate them by month and looked at the percentage of fail to deliver shares as a proportion of the float based on the yahoo finance. I picked a couple of companies which are 'hot' on WSB now and also some large caps that have been under heavy shorting such as TSLA and AAPL. GS was also chosen to see how things look like for large banks with their own clearing house.

As you can see in the two graphs below, the percentage of fail to deliver for GME is through the roof for the past year. Even for heavily shorted stocks like TSLA, the percent of shares that failed to deliver is extremely low throughout 2020.

[https://ibb.co/4VsLqhw](https://ibb.co/4VsLqhw)

In terms of the total number of shares, it is clear that there is a lot of naked shorting and a ridiculous number of shares failed to deliver over the course of 2020.

[https://ibb.co/mCzXkPQ](https://ibb.co/mCzXkPQ)

The fact that this data is publicly available from SEC and that SEC has not acted upon it is beyond my comprehension. Then again I'm only a retard who loves GME and will hold it to infinity and beyond. And please don't be a smart ass and start buying other companies. Hold on and buy GME, this house needs some cleaning up. Screw the central banks for printing so much money and allowing the whole financial system to become as blatantly corrupt as it as become.

16,"Some owners of TSLA probably liked Elon's tweet and wanted to help stick it to the hedgies so they cashed a portion of their shares to get into GME.

I wouldn't be surprised. People are willing to follow the man to Mars."
17,Kinda like how Pelosi bought TSLA just prior to the announcement of it becoming the new fed fleet provider?
18,"He said he wants risky. Screw TSLA, screw HTZ.

Edit: I support this! Let's make this happen.

u/MrBeast100kinvest add another 0 to your bet so we can make Elon the richest man in the world."
27,We really about to make mr beast the first trillonaire because since stocks only rise TSLA should be at around 10k by then
28,Correct TSLA Sept $5000 call option
29,$TSLA $3500 C Sept is for sure the way to go as many of you have supported me. It is the best answer because it has 2% chance of working or less and if it just gets to $5500 or even the hint to $5k we get $1.25 million.
30,Ask the TSLA shorters how it worked out for them.  Gotta cover eventually.
31,"TSLA $20k option

32,I have the GME ticker set on my Apple Watch and I accidentally switched it to TSLA. Imagine my hustle when I thought GME was at $660 just now. HA!
33,"Nah man, below all the comments on a massive loss telling them to suck dick behind a Wendy's and spend the money on OTM TSLA calls to get it all back, has always been a fair number of people being supportive of people with real gambling addictions, reminding them that it's only money, and that if you can't handle options ""responsibly""(sorta relative here, not becoming homeless), you're better off quitting"
34,I see what you are saying but I dont agree there is any similarity with TSLA and GME. GME is not a company with huge potential that some see and some dont. Its price has nothing to do with the company. Its literally just an attempt to cause a huge squeeze against HFs. No one thinks GME deserves these prices long term. No one can make that argument. The only thing anyone can argue for is a temporary spike not due to anything to do with GME but only to do with people on the other side of a trade. Plenty of people have been making reasonable arguments in favor of TSLA for a long time. One is a difference in opinion with where a company is headed. The other is a difference in opinion of a singular event completely unrelated to the actual company.
35,"BB announces partnership with TSLA, aaaaand their stock drops further down to $5"
36,"You can't share inside info BUT you can post your share transaction history with the world in real time using a bot on Twitter.  

If i see a notification pop up saying you just bought $10 of $TSLA i'm buying $5 of $TSLA the same day.  

So you can count on my vote.  

Please giv badge?"
37,The Directors job is to post memes on r/wsb As long as their stock keeps going up they can keep raising money through convertible bonds like TSLA did. Infinite tendie machine and all that is needed is to keep r/wsb from getting bored
38,"Lol after Elon tweeted the other day, I promised I'd dump all my GME gains into TSLA and let it ride"
39,"TSLA is the best bet if you're going long. In 10 years you'll be very rich. Until then, who knows."
40,"- Their unassailable lead in EVs that keeps getting bigger (better software for battery management, better mileage, much more data collected for self-driving than anyone else, better and constantly improving manufacturing techniques and machines.. I could go on)
- They will finish solving self-driving this year, and lease the software to other companies who have no hope of catching up. That's $$$$
- They consistently meet or beat their targets that matter most, especially deliveries (half million in 2020 targeted by Musk in 2014, target met)
- Rapid expansion happening in 2021 and every year after (more factories, more output from their two existing factories, more efficient processes)
- Their unexpected (by the mainstream media anyway) success and record numbers during the pandemic
- Solar and battery tech
- Their investment in neural networks and cameras to solve self driving (like a human brain + eyes) on existing infrastructure instead of wasting time with LIDAR (lol)
- Autonomous taxis (billions in potential alone)
- Elon Musk. This one matters most. I'd rather invest in people than numbers that look good on a spreadsheet

Tesla is absolutely not worth $800/share ($800 billion market cap) right now, but in 10 years that will look DIRT CHEAP.

I buy TSLA every chance I get. Couldn't care less what it costs right now.

From 2008 to 2018 I was all about AAPL and did very well. For the next decade I'm all-in on TSLA."

If I had a dollar for every unoriginal TSLA, PLTR, GME post on here, telling me to buy it, i could buy 1 stock of each, every week"
44,TSLA cult got triggered
45,SO You can be a TSLA shill but not NIO? Sounds like double standard bullshit to me. Just smells of american exceptionalism.
46,"This sub is pretty much 99% ""DD"" or meme pump posts and 1% ""I'm so smart, I gained a fuck ton (this time)"" or ""Lol I lost like 300k nbd"". It's not even worth the effort to get angry over any one post. The amount of pumping on PLTR, GME, TSLA, NIO of course, and others in recent months has made me rarely look at posts other than daily discussion, and even then in those it's like 90% rocket ship pump comments."
47,"why ban and delete? the arguments didn't seem that unfounded. besides having perspective from other major markets would be good wouldn't it?

Sure CCP can rig the game, they can outnumber WSB x a billion, but that doesn't mean every chinese person thinks the same. banning someone because they are a NIO fanatic  would be black listing a $TSLA bull because they're working for the NSA (note: i'm KGB and can confirm everyone else on this sub-reddit is autistic)

imagine if just 1% of chinese citizens became WSBtards... think of the power"
48,"Oh yeah, I‚Äôve been noticing this also. I just ignore it. TSLA will power America mother Fuckers or will have another March in protest of fucking TSLA jr nio"
49,"If CCP cares too much on you retards, they will let Ant IPO go as planned. 

They will lionize Ma as a savior of their crippling economy. 

Just because some autists wrote home about NIO doesn't mean shit on his association with CCP.

It's like you're claiming someone who glamorize TSLA to be some form of African inflitration because Elon was originally from South Africa."
50,"Yeah, but if we have to choose a company to power US, it‚Äôs TSLA over TSLA jr nio."
51,That is the only reason anyone ITT cares about this. They are all long TSLA. The PLTR and GME shilling is way worse than this.
52,"Tencent's largest shareholder (around 30%) is Naspers, a South African company. Why don't you just say Reddit is controlled by South Africans?

Oh wait Elon is also South African. TSLA to the moon confirmed."
53,For real. Or Elon with tesla. TSLA would go straight to sub 100 if Elon disappears.
54,This board has been astroturfed by PLTR and GME retards every day for months the only reason you care about this particular shill campaign is because you likely have a long position in TSLA
55,"That would give them a market cap of around or near the valuation of TSLA, today.  Within... 5 months time.  Good luck with all that."
56,"Finally someone said it. Forgot my password to an old account I've been in this bitch since 2016 fucked my money up on TSLA and Spy options. Took a hiatus and came back with new account before GME. 

These new kids think it's some safe haven where everyone works together. 

Fuck that it's a dog eat dog world out here bro."

68,"The next 20 largest car makers combined + Samsung + Panasonic barley add up to more than half of TSLA's market cap. The only narrative is the Elon hype train.

There's only one direction TSLA's price can go over the long term. Gates position is the obvious one based on the facts. Musks emotional insistence that he close it at a loss is absurd."

72,"#My humble proposal:

(I would do it if I had the skill)

- Someone should code a bot or a few bots to respond to random posts with random or otherwise obfuscating stock positions.

- I say random because I'm unsure of whether targeted but insincere positions could be seen as manipulation. If not, then target them and change the targets every so often.

- This would help scramble the algorithms by giving them junk data.

- This would further fuck over wall street because they'd be getting junk information and have already paid out or entered into contracts for access to that data (not sure which way it works).

- This would fuck over the people producing the algorithms because it would cast doubts on their methodology and the usefulness of employing their services. Hopefully, this would help stop the practice before it becomes mainstream.

#Alternatively, we should all adopt the convention of signing off our posts with random janky stock positions.

- Example:

Buy TSLA, Sell MSFT, Short XRX

- We would all know this was nonsense, but skimmers wouldn't.

- Could mods even put this suggestion in the side bar? I don't think it's illegal to try to counteract algorithms if it's not explicitly coordinated (like, everyone put exactly X, Y, Z in their post). Once again, if that's not the case, then target them and change the targets every so often.

**Feel free to add to, refine, or share this idea. I'm dumb and have no idea what I'm doing.**"
73,"Same thing happened to me, im 24 and working 2 jobs cuz I put all my money into and TSLA calls and lost all of it smh"
74,WTF with people coming into the GME thread laughing at the stock talking bullshit about power hour.  What did TSLA get up to today?  Is RBLX crushing it for you?  Did PLTR goes bonkers?  Thought not so get the fuck outta here.
75,"I sold 75% of my holdings, that were not GME, AMC, BB (GME was my last buy of the 3) and moved the money out. RH actually got it out today, faster than they said. Thinking it would be longer, I moved money from my savings to Fidelity. That had a security hold, because it was a new account and a decent chunk of cash. The move has fucked me a bit, TSLA up a good chunk since I sold 75% at $814, but I'll recover. I just want to get moving so I can start buying back in and start with a non-fucked broker. As soon as this GME situation clears, I'll change Brokers completely. Hopefully that won't be a year out."
76,"This isn‚Äôt about wsb or memes or GME. 

This is about changing the narrative, show how the hedge funds have been manipulating a company for years. 

This is about showing the world how hedge funds can single handle bring a company bankrupt, 

Showing the world how the media will report on unfounded news of ‚Äúsqueeze‚Äù Jan 12-15 when it hasn‚Äôt occurred. 

This isn‚Äôt the Big Short where a handful of hedge funds won against another, 

Or Volkswagen where a Company (Porsche) was able to coordinate a squeeze. 

Or KBIO where an individual was able to control prices of a stock. 

This is GME , it‚Äôs democracy at its best. Where people voted with their money; and we want to be heard. 

For once in history, the little guys and I stress guys because it‚Äôs not any single one of you but a collective but not coordinated interest. 

We did not set a date to send all the buy orders in. 

We did not set a date to dump. 

We did not set a price to enter or leave. 

We merely have seen an undervalued company who deserves a second chance, and just like the residents here who blow their bank on Weeklies &FDs; shorting this company carried a risk and the hedge funds MUST be made known that they MUST endure that risk unfolding. 

#When this is over, I hope the world can see how the media ACTIVELY partook in spreading misinformation. 

#There is never an accusation a firm, or bank, or VCs manipulating parts of the market albeit it‚Äôs clearly obvious and true to a tee they do. 

Whether it is GoldMansacks or Morgan Stanley posting arbitrarily low targets for TSLA before loading up on shares, or Citron refusing to disclose their positions despite having SoapBox individual power. 

There are numerous evidence suggesting analysts with affiliations to funds actively beat down a stock only to have an interest to purchase. 

Numerous evidence that suggest insiders getting IPOs at posted prices only to leave retail bag holding (SNOW) at multiples. 

This hurts companies this hurts retail. 

Occam‚Äôs Razor suggest it‚Äôs far more likely a stock is manipulated by a handful of firms with ties to one another than millions of retail traders coordinating like a school of fish swimming the same direction. 

#I believe an autist with a phone, a community, internet, and access to EDGAR / SEDAR/ Quiver Quant  is far more knowledgeable than the ShoeShineKid spouting tax advice to Kennedy a century ago. Fuck them with their straw dummy argument. 

I will see you guys on the other side."
77,"Yeah, last month TSLA led the sell-off of the entire market tanking just before GME exploded over the next 2 days.

EVERY ticker I own was red today except for GME.

This either means:

a) WSB hype truly *can* and does move individual stocks, so people saying that isn't possible are incorrect

b) Hedges & institutions were selling off *everything else* in order to deal w/GME prior to expiration of 2/26 options tomorrow.

c) it's a complete coincidence, and GME just happens to be *such* an amazing company that it alone withstood the entirety of the U.S. stock market dropping all around it."
78,"He doesn't actually want to buy twitter. He tweeted that he would sell his current ownership if they don't accept the bid. Probably just wants to dump his shares at the pumped up TWTR price and this gives him cover to do so. Same this as the whole ""sell $10bn in TSLA and pay tax"" fiasco where he had a tax bill due anyway from decade-old stock options."

81,"I sold all my TSLA stock the day before to settle my margin, then YOLO'd the profits into GME with zero margin. I saw this shit coming a mile away. Also, I use TD so I only had mild/moderate inconvenient buying experiences. 

In hindsight, I'm so lucky I dodged both those bullets. I saw SS of people who had all of their shares liquidated by RH. It's gonna take years to untangle all of this. It fucking egregious!"
82,"I'm guessing because right now, there are at least 6-8 stocks getting hammered, not just one.

Was the TSLA squeeze shooting up some 1000% + in one month and 200-400% in a few days? Also was it damn near 200M in volume everyday for one week?"
83,"I kind of agree. But if you bought shares for every shares for the stock that had elaborate DD in this sub you almost exclusively made money if you didnt paper hand  **üßª‚úã** like a retard. TSLA, NIO, AAPL, PRPL, PLTR, GME are just the most notable examples.  
Ofc you're gonna get fucked if you buy weeklies first day in or sell at the slightest dip."

85,Sold all my TSLA for GME. Tendie man cometh.
86,"The purest form of market manipulation ever witnessed in plain sight. This guy is a damn fool. I have a buddy that owns a large bag of TSLA stock that he bought at IPO, he is now a millionaire three times over. If he could tea bag Elon he would. I told him back in January that this guy is a damn fool and he should sell every share at 900.00 and retire.  His response, ""no way, it is going to blow past $1000 and I am holding out for $2,000"". I called him today and asked him how his plan was working out after TSLA dipped below $600. He has lost enough since January to feed an entire country in Africa. Tonight, after this fool opened his mouth again, I sent him a text and told him if he ever got to tea bag him, to make sure he bites down real hard.  

He will go buy 1B worth of DOGE and announce that TSLA is taking DOGE for cars. it will rocket past $1.00, he will sell it all and then say it isn't working either...

&#x200B;

This can happen because there is NO REGULATION in crypto.  If he did this in the stock market, he would be charged with a crime."

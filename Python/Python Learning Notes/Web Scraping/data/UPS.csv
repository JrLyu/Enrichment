0,"Can confirm, used to work at UPS Store and we almost had to force customers to take tracking receipts for Verizon and Comcast returns because they were “lost” so often. "
1,"I remember giving the UPS guy my ATT cable stuff. To quote from him ""keep this receipt until you die"". Fuck ATT. Too bad my only other option is Comcast.

I wish we could as a whole rally together and make them stop doing this shit, but what do I know, right?"
2,I work for UPS airport hub and all I am going to say is this week is going to be absolute hell. Expecting 2-4 53 foot trailers to come in everyday. 
3,I work at UPS and the only thing me and my co workers can talk about is how crazy it is that people are spending money just because Amazon made a special day for it. Also this week is going to suck hard core.  Please help.
4,"This happened to me in college when I applied for a personal shopper job. Literally, had an online interview and went to bed not thinking anything of it. The next morning I woke up to a UPS delivery with a $2,000 money order in it.  It freaked me out and I knew it was a scam. I mean who sends $2,000 out that easily? Police didn't care of course and I was so young I didn't know who else to reach out to. 

Funny thing is the ad was approved by someone at my university and was listed on our Career connection site for undergrads. Great job coach! haha"
5,"FYI The Postal Inspectors also cover FedEx, UPS, etc not just US Mail. 

Basically anything that gets sent, even bank wires / transfers are investigated by the Postal Inspectors. "
6,"You can report it to FedEx so that if they are using a compromised shipping account they can shut that down, but that's as far as it goes.

If something is sent via USPS is a federal crime, and they have legal authority to peruse it.  Through a commercial entity such as UPS or FedEx it is generally a civil matter for theft of services, and it's up to them to pursue it with whichever law enforcement agency it might fall under, which they probably will not bother with.  You could report it to local law enforcement, and they MIGHT deal with the Feds if it was sent interstate, but it's all up to the PD what they will do.

7,"Or if you live with your parents — get a UPS Store (or whatever) box do you can have your own mailing address.   Also handy as a more stable address if you move around in the city or are in dorms, etc."
8,"Something similar happened to my coworker a couple months ago. His personal email blew up with all kinds of spam to hide a couple order confirmation emails from Best Buy. The scammer ordered about a dozen laptops and they were to be shipped (1 did) to an address just down the block from my coworker's apartment. A call to his bank, Best Buy, and UPS (to attempt to intercept the one that shipped) and things got worked out in a matter of a few hours. This happened while we were at work and that certainly gave him a bit of a scare, and detailed his afternoon."

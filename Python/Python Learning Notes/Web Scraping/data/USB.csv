0,"Cloud storage is very cheap and incredibly handy.  I use Google Drive and get some space for free and it's dirt cheap to get like 100Gb.  Use it for receipts, documents, whatever.  You can also get a cheap USB document scanner and set it up to automatically scan and load stuff to your cloud storage so you have digital backups.  "
1,"Back in 2011/12 I brought 4 bitcoin for Â£12 each. I had recently heard about this new currency and figured I would see if they would ever increase enough so I could cash them later. 

Stored them in an offline wallet on my laptop, and backed it up on a USB drive.

Anyway, I ended up forgetting about them until just before Xmas just gone. Looked up the price and thought holy shit, I got money... go me.

Then I remembered that the hard drive I had the wallet on died about 2 years ago. Fuck.... Wait a minute, I got the usb backup. Go me.....

So I find the usb drive, plug it in, and my heart sinks. 

At some point over the years I obviously forgot what this drive had on it as it had a load of random files for work, spreadsheets, documents etc. But no wallet file. I must have formatted it. I tried everything I could to recover the file but it was gone.

I still have the dead hard drive, somewhere. Who knows, one day I might even work out which drive it was (I have many old dead drives). Then I can sit and look at it and imagine what life could have been like if wasn't so stupid to create just one more backup.

Or I might just frame it, titled ""My greatest mistake""

I still have one Casascius physical bitcoin 1btc that is unredeemed, but I refuse to redeem that as i promised it to my son when he turns 18.

2,"Eh, I'd say it's still fine to buy stuff you weren't initially planning on getting as long as you know you'll use it. Like, first Prime Day I bought a portable battery for charging USB devices. It wasn't something I knew I wanted, but I saw it and thought it would be useful, and it really has been. It holds a charge for a long time and has been very useful in power outages, long trips, and conventions.

That's pretty much the main reason I like browsing sales. Sometimes I can find solutions to problems I didn't know I could afford to solve."
3,"TOTP is literally exactly the same to phish as SMS. 

1. Send user to a phishing page.

2. Ask for their password. Record it.

3. Redirect them to a phishing page that asks for their TOTP code. 

4. Enter the password and then enter the TOTP code into the service to authenticate as the victim.

You can automate the entire process.

FIDO won't let you sign a message for a different domain than the one asking for the second factor. This means that the message you give to the attacker cannot be proxied to the service. You don't need a ""bunch of keys"". You buy one and register it to all of the services you use. They even make ones that sit in your USB drive permanently.

If you don't trust the local device then there is literally nothing you could ever do in order to authenticate safely. So why even bring that up?"
4,"Direct attacks against phone companies to redirect SMS traffic are fairly common, which is why it's consider a poor second factor. Recently, [Reddit lost a lot of old passwords sure to intercepted SMS messages](https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2018/08/password-breach-teaches-reddit-that-yes-phone-based-2fa-is-that-bad/). (The graphic with a phishing form is misleading, the article explains the attack further down.) TOTP isn't perfect, but it's immune to this type of attack and it's better. Yubikey is definitely a better solution where it can be implemented. (I had an employer who banned all USB devices from their buildings, which made ""just put a yubikey on your key ring"" a non-viable solution for people like me.)

Tangent: Email is also consider a poor second factor, for anyone reading this who might be tempted to use it instead. Attackers who can get into a victim's email can typically reset passwords for most of their accounts using that email address. This means that for most websites ""access to email"" becomes a single authentication factor."

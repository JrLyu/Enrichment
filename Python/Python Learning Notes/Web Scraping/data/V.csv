The fallout will be predictable, my money is on top threads claiming all due to external illegal factors - already seeing it. V culty."
1,"It’s not a loss until you sell. WSB went from 2m to 8m in one week. It’s 4X powerful now. Hedges finally got their shit together after the weekend but this ain’t over, not for me 💎🙌

Also, let’s stop using the word S-I-L-V-E-R and use this 💍 💍 💍 Let’s not help their SEO on this 💍 distraction"

Don't let them fck you by manipulating you and tricking you into selling them their stocks back to cover the shorts. I'm holding idc this is bigger than tendies"

5,"South African here. We don't have much economy left. Unemployment is around 60%. Nothing is safe from theft here. 80% of the money that was assigned to secure covid vaccinations for our public was 'misappropriated' and stolen.
You have no prospects if you are not African.
Massive rasism exists towards Indians, Asians and Caucasians. It's not a personal thing you feel. People on the street are smiling and happy. They wave at one another.
When you apply for a job, your C.V. gets thrown in the trash. Your government applications like vehicle licensing or permits take three times longer.
A tactic they are using to stop whites from emigration is to conveniently loose their documents.
I personally know three people who have no birth certificates. Once you apply for a visa it turns out your vaulted birth certificate goes ""missing"""

9,"They all already decided. Pandemic shortages have made things difficult. Imagine how many commercials you’d see to lease a new EV during this gas crisis if they were sitting around in lots.

I don’t even know the order delay time, but my guess is 6 months. 

By the mid 20’s I expect most people buying a new car to be buying an EV. 

Tesla’s big gambit is that they’re gonna be the big energy provider. The big solar panel maker. The king of self-driving.

I hope they are successful, I don’t think they’ll be #1 or anywhere near what they expect.

Do you know who has the most convenient real estate in America? The McDonalds corporation. Could they have ever merged with a gas company? No. Gross. 

But adding EV chargers to every lot in America and charging people just a little over cost? They could re-design their store to be less closed off. More open air. All all those customers smell their French fries and buy some fast food.

LG is the big solar panel maker. 

So then it’s the just the cars. Once you can buy a civic, acccord, camery, f-150, Altima, sienna, 330i, A4, c-class, wrangler, RAv4, Cr-V, and Q5 all at the same price and look as their gas versions?

It’s over. Tesla is going to have to sell people on something else."

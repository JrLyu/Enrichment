0,"Washing crockpot liners and other pots and pans don't have to be difficult. Soak and use Bar Keeper's Friend. You don't want to run hot pans under cold water, but everything will be easier to clean if you fill with water asap after using. (also great excuse to soak overnight)

There's a lot of controversy on the safeness of all plastics, but there's already some proof that some plastics are definitely not safe--at least enough that almost all food grade plastic products are now BPA free. I'd be even more concerned about harmful chemicals because you're heating the plastic up and eating the liquid these chemicals are leaching into. YUM.

Since the liners are already expensive and bad for the environment, I just don't use them or oven bags to cook in. Although, they do make brining easier--place raw meat and chilled brine/marinade in bag, seal, and refrigerate or put in cooler and cover with ice.

TL;DR--cleaning crockpots isn't really hard, some plastics are bad for you, & since the bags are also expensive and harmful to the enivronment, don't use them. Except for easier meat brining. "

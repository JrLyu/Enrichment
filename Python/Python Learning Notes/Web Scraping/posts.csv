We’re at historic levels of terrible affordability.  If rates continue to stay high or raise people just won’t sell, keeping supply low and prices high while we pay out the ass in interest. If rates drop then demand will increase and prices will raise.

Is there really any scenario in the next 5-10 years where prices in mid to major cities will be affordable to normal people who are first time buyers without 6 figures of equity?

Would you fire my advisor?,162,17rwcgk,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17rwcgk/would_you_fire_my_advisor/,193,"I moved to a new financial advisor in July 2022. Portfolio value at the time was $800K. They sold all but two of my existing stocks (AAPL, AMZN) and invested heavily (but not exclusively) in consumer discretionary stocks. Results: 2022 down 11%, 2023 down almost 9% YTD. Overall, down close to 20%. 

The new portfolio is extremely volatile, usually 1-2% swings each day, but today it went down ~4% due to huge losses in just two stocks. Some individual stocks are down 55-70% YTD; few are in the black. Just about every stock is performing worse than its respective market index. 

In the case of the biggest losers, the chief investment officer basically went to the sunk cost fallacy - we (I) have lost so much we should just hold to see what can be recovered.  

Right now I’m so angry about today’s loss (I didn’t mention the stock that lost 25% yesterday) that I dare not call or email until I can get a grip on my emotions.

I know that maybe except for the S&P 500, the market’s performance has not been great this year, but my portfolio’s losses just seem so extreme that I think I need to stop working with these folks.

Why is currency arbitrage not prevalent in mortgages?,17,17s64gs,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/17s64gs/why_is_currency_arbitrage_not_prevalent_in/,30,"I’m a bit surprised there isn’t a VC back tech company that’s figured out how to offer people mortgages at lower than market rates. The rate would be adjustable to offset some FX fluctuations.

Example

China interest rate is 3.45%

Japan interest rate is 3.16%

US interest rate on 30 Yr fixed mortgage is 7.384%

Colombia mortgage rate is 20.120%

Consumer A wants to buy a $500k house. Most US banks offer a 30 year loan at 8-10% interest.

Arbitrage company borrows $500k from Japanese bank at 4% fixed for 30 years. Then offers Consumer A 5.5% ARM with 30% down payment or 6.5% ARM with 20% down payment or 7% fixed with 10% down payment.  

Thesis - japans rates will remain low for the next 5 years, possibly 10 years. Requiring a 30% down payment provides a buffer in times of currency fluctuations and also helps to reduce the investment risk. The down payment also acts as a sort of vetting since few Americans have $1,000 saved up so the ones who have 30% saved up will be pretty safe borrowers in terms of risk. The 1.5-3% interest arbitrage also acts as a buffer. At scale, this could be packaged together and sold to retail and institutional bond investors and that spread would increase the company’s profits per sale. Lastly, homes in the US generally retain their value and due to housing supply shortages, there will be ample opportunities to liquidate. 


It seems that borrowing from foreign banks, regardless of the country, is incredibly hard. Most seem to only do business with their own citizens or people with long history in the country and are residents (green/residency card or passport). I’m in the U.S. and it seems pretty hard to get a loan from a Japan bank for instance. Chinese bank is even harder. I have never stepped foot in any of these countries yet. Colombia seems slightly easier but it depends on which bank location you go to and the employee. 

Also you could expand this to country’s with sky high interest rates such as Colombia. Pitch being that taking out the loan and buying property would help secure a green card or residency in participating countries with investment visa programs. So property values would be stable and probably propped up. As long as credit standards are maintained, there shouldn’t be any real problems like that of the US financial crash.

What do you think?

Update

To further lessen currency risk, you could require buyer put up 10% (in the example $50,000) that would go towards an insurance policy or investment vehicle over the life of the property. At the end of the mortgage, the buyer receives whatever money is left over. If currency remained flat or deprecated, buyer would get full amount, maybe slightly less. If the currency fluctuated harder, then the buyer loses it all. This would still be cheaper than paying market rate interest over the life of the mortgage. I have very little knowledge about insurance so feel free to correct me or come up with a structure that could work.",1699629361.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Audit your insurance coverage!** How long has it been since you examined your coverage or gotten a quote from another company to look for cheaper insurance? As your life evolves, it's important to make sure you update your insurance coverage as well. This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

Paid $600 for Plumber Even Though I Rent My Unit,218,17rzrkf,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/17rzrkf/paid_600_for_plumber_even_though_i_rent_my_unit/,156,"I am moving out of my unit tomorrow.

I couldn’t argue with that, it’s in black and white. I called a plumber. I wasn’t about to cause a big scene over a clogged drain, figured it would be $100 or so and it would help me from having issues on my final walkthrough inspection with the landlord tomorrow. 

 $600 dollars and 2 hours later and the clog was fixed. 

On the invoice he left the remarks: “Clog was about 6~8 feet down from the shower floor. No hair or other debris came back on the snake head.” He told me that this was not at all caused by hair and was probably due to years and years of some kind of buildup.

Expected moves: SPY QQQ SPX and strike selection at low vol,3,17s57xm,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/17s57xm/expected_moves_spy_qqq_spx_and_strike_selection/,3,"&#x200B;

Futures are higher this morning following yesterday's Powell (and yields) induced pullback. As we've been mentioning all week the market is taking a bit of a breather from the volatility of the past month. Rallies finding sellers and sell-offs finding buyers is a sign of a market loaded with gamma after a rapid decline in the VIX. Keep an eye on those trends. What usually clears those conditions are either a large expiration (Nov monthly expiry is on the 17th) or market-moving news that is enough to send the indices from a heavy gamma area (strikes with lots of open interest) towards areas of either short gamma or low open interest. 

Even with the red day yesterday, the VIX is below 15 as we enter Friday. The SPX is essentially unchanged on the week. If this week's trading action were to carry over into next week the VIX could see low teens. With that low IV comes very tight expected moves day to day so those selling options for income should be aware of where their strikes are in relation to the underlying. 

When vol is super low a market (or individual stock) will tend to go outside its expected move more often than when vol is super high. The difference being that when vol is super high it may violate the expected move by a lot more while when vol is low it may just go outside barely. So it often makes sense in low vol environments to go a bit wider from the stock, taking in less premium but giving enough room for those slight violations of the expected move to not be a big loser.

Microsoft $MSFT at all time high!,140,17s8uuv,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17s8uuv/microsoft_msft_at_all_time_high/,42,"Microsoft $MSFT shares rose nearly 1.7% on Friday to $366.63, hitting an all-time for the tech giant.

Shares have climbed more than 11% over the past month, resulting in the Satya Nadella-led firm having a market cap of $2.7T. Investor sentiment has been buoyed by the company's recent quarterly results, which showed better-than-expected growth at its Azure cloud unit, as well as a drop in interest rates.

Earlier this week, Jefferies analyst Brent Thill said Microsoft $MSFT is in one of the best buy cycles seen in a long time, and the deployment of artificial intelligence can catapult its success even further.",1699636741.0

$PLUG drops 43% post Q3 earnings -,9,17savif,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17savif/plug_drops_43_post_q3_earnings/,7,"Plug Power $PLUG drops 43% as Q3 results disappoint, with a larger loss and lower revenues than expected, citing severe supply challenges in the hydrogen market. Loss widened to $283.5M, gross margins fell, and despite growth in power agreements and fuel delivery, market constraints hampered deployment and margins. 

Plug (PLUG) noted the ""unprecedented"" number of hydrogen facilities in the market running below nameplate capacity, which has ""caused significant hydrogen shortages impacting deployment schedules, fuel prices, shipping efficiencies, service on hydrogen infrastructures, and timing of varied reliability rollout programs.""

The company said it will need to tap capital markets to fund its business, as it pursues a number of potential project financing solutions, including corporate debt, loan programs through the Department of Energy, and a memorandum of understanding with Fortescue Metals in which Fortescue (OTCQX:FSUMF) would take a 40% equity stake in Plug's (PLUG) Texas hydrogen plant and for Plug to take up to a 25% equity stake in a Fortescue hydrogen plant.",1699642254.0

This agreement involves producing 15 million units annually of Joyburst Hydration beverages at Flow's Aurora, Ontario facility.  
  
Flow's CEO Nicholas Reichenbach expressed enthusiasm about this partnership, highlighting the Aurora facility's potential to aid Joyburst's production goals. This deal also appears to align with Flow's ongoing efforts to divest its Aurora facility, aiming to maximize its value.

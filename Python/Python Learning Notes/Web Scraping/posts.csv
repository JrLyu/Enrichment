&#x200B;

I was in my early teens during the '08 crisis. I vividly remember the enormous repercussions that the reckless actions by those on Wall Street had in my personal life, and the lives of those close to me. I was fortunate - my parents were prudent and a little paranoid, and they had some food storage saved up. When that crisis hit our family, we were able to keep our little house, but we lived off of pancake mix, and powdered milk, and beans and rice for a year. Ever since then, my parents have kept a food storage, and they keep it updated and fresh.

Those close to me, my friends and extended family, were not nearly as fortunate. My aunt moved in with us and paid what little rent she could to my family while she tried to find any sort of work. Do you know what tomato soup made out of school cafeteria ketchup packets taste like? My friends got to find out. Almost a year after the crisis' low, my dad had stabilized our income stream and to help out others, he was hiring my friends' dads for odd house work. One of them built a new closet in our guest room. Another one did some landscaping in our backyard. I will forever be so proud of my parents, because in a time of need, even when I have no doubt money was still tight, they had the mindfulness and compassion to help out those who absolutely needed it.

To Melvin Capital: you stand for everything that I hated during that time. You're a firm who makes money off of exploiting a company and manipulating markets and media to your advantage. Your continued existence is a sharp reminder that the ones in charge of so much hardship during the '08 crisis were not punished. And your blatant disregard for the law, made obvious months ago through your (for the Melvin lawyers out there: alleged) illegal naked short selling and more recently your obscene market manipulation after hours shows that you haven't learned a single thing since '08. And why would you? Your ilk were bailed out and rewarded for terrible and illegal financial decisions that negatively changed the lives of millions. I bought shares a few days ago. I dumped my savings into GME, paid my rent for this month with my credit card, and dumped my rent money into more GME (which for the people here at WSB, I would not recommend). And I'm holding. This is personal for me, and millions of others. You can drop the price of GME after hours $120, I'm not going anywhere. You can pay for thousands of reddit bots, I'm holding. You can get every mainstream media outlet to demonize us, I don't care. I'm making this as painful as I can for you.

To CNBC: you must realize your short term gains through promoting institutions' agenda is just that - short term. Your staple audience will soon become too old to care, and the millions of us, not just at WSB but every person affected by the '08 crash that's now paying attention to GME, are going to remember how you stuck up for the firms that ruined so many of us, and tried to tear down the little guys. I know for sure I'll remember this. In response, here is a [list of CNBC sponsors and partners](https://www.cnbcevents.com/sponsors/). They include, but are not limited to, **IBM**, **Cisco**, **TMobile**, **JPMorgan**, **Oracle**, and **ZipRecruiter**. Their parent company is [NBCUniversal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBCUniversal), owned by **Comcast** and **GE**.

To the boomers, and/or people close to that age, just now paying attention to these ""millennial blog posts"": you realize that, even if you weren't adversely effected by the '08 crash, your children and perhaps grandchildren most likely were? *We're not enemies, we're on the same side*. Stop listening to the media that's making us out to be market destroyers, and start rooting for us, because we have a once in a lifetime opportunity to punish the sort of people who caused so much pain and stress a decade ago, and we're taking that opportunity. Your children, your grandchildren, might have suffered as I described because of the institutions that we're fighting against. You really want to choose them, over your own family and friends? We're not asking you to risk your 401k or retirement fund on a single GME bet. We're just asking you to be understanding, supportive, and to not support the people that caused so much suffering a decade ago.

To WSB: you all are amazing. I imagine that I'm not the only one that this is personal for. I've read myself so many posts on what you guys went through during the '08 crash. Whether you're here for the gains, to stick it to the man as I am, or just to be part of a potentially market changing movement - thank you. Each and every one of you are the reason that we have this chance. I've never felt this optimistic about the future before. This is life changing amounts of money for so many of you, and to be part of a rare instance of a wealth distribution from the rich to the poor is just incredible. I love you all.

We've got so many comments and submissions that we can't possibly even read them all, let alone act on them as moderators. We wrote software to do most of the moderation for us but that software isn't allowed to read the Reddit new feed fast enough and submit responses, and the admins haven't given us special access despite asking for it.

We're suffering from success and our Discord was the first casualty. You know as well as I do that if you gather 250k people in one spot someone is going to say something that makes you look bad. That room was golden and the people that run it are awesome. We blocked all bad words with a bot, which should be enough, but apparently if someone can say a bad word with weird unicode icelandic characters and someone can screenshot it you don't get to hang out with your friends anymore. Discord did us dirty and **I am not impressed with them destroying our community** instead of stepping in with the wrench we may have needed to fix things, especially after we got over 1,000 server boosts. That is pretty unethical.

To add to this, people are co-opting our name on twitter. I won't mention their accounts, but lots of handles with ""wsb"" and ""wallstreetbets"" in them are pretending to speak for us. They're saying things that we don't agree with, driving traffic to derivative communities and shitty pixelated merch stores, and generally making it harder for us to define who we are. There's also too much political bullshit in a community that was never *ever* political. The only way I want to occupy Wall St is in a suit myself or rent-free in the mind of a blown up short.

~~That is why I'm throwing my support behind the Twitter handle in general. We need a way to PUBLICLY reach out to the staff of the infrastructure that is failing us so the world can see that we aren't doing anything wrong here if they don't respond. We need to be able to respond directly to a reporter that is lying to the world about our clubhouse. We can't be expected to meet any expectations when we aren't given the tools we need.~~

~~That's not to say I approve of every message or will even be in the loop for all of them, but it's clear to me we can't do nothing and we need a megaphone.~~

~~We'll do our best not to pretend to speak for you, but to try to speak with the volume our name now seems to command to get shit done for us.~~

Just hold your stock, buy more if you can afford to! 

Check out real time trade stats by googling: ""Nasdaq AMC real time trades"" and you'll see all the trade orders are 100 share volumes every millisecond. 

These are desperate hedge funds trading their stocks back and forth for a lower and lower price, driving the price down. The price drop means absolutely nothing AS LONG AS EVERYONE IS HOLDING, this will explode!

The shirts tried their damndest to drive down the share prices of both $GME and $AMC today. Specifically look at $AMC. With all that volume traded you‚Äôd expect a shitload more movement. What they got was **resistance** You could see them continuing the ladder attack after hours when YOU can‚Äôt trade. On BOTH stocks. 

The way forward is to tell them to go fuck themselves and BUY that shit up tomorrow. Let them keep punting the football back and forth to one another all day. If they can double down and play the long game SO can we. 

This is not financial advice. I‚Äôm just a retard who REALLY likes these stocks.

They've been illegally ""closing out"" their short positions and if we hold they will 100% get fucked. There is far more nefarious shit at play.**

So this morning I saw the S3 and Ortex data both report significant covering of short positions for GME. This absolutely threw me for a loop because Friday morning they reported above ~120% short interest still. I could not for the life of me figure out how someone could close >50% of short positions on such a tightly held stock in ONE day with very little trading volume in the week. This got me digging around to figure out what's up.

I started by looking into GME failed to delivers (i.e. short sellers not able to cover their position on a stock) for the first half of January and I was shocked to find that just in the first 15 days of Jan, GME had ~1.2 MILLION failed to delivers. This is before most of wsb or mainstream began buying.

What was interesting though, is that of that ~1.2million, ~700K shares were covered in chunks throughout the two week period. I dug further back into the SEC failed to deliver reports for GME and saw that pattern extending back months. It seemed almost as if the short positions were just being kicked down the road.

Having spent some time looking at the pattern, it's clear a large amount of failed to delivers come in, then a small chunk of coverage, then another large amount, and so on. To me this looked shady af so I looking into reasons that could cause that and discovered this article: https://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ocie/options-trading-risk-alert.pdf

In it, a specific section is eerily similar to what we've experienced with GME:

""Assuming that XYZ (e.g. GME) is a hard to borrow security (e.g. apes holding strong), and that Trader A (Melvin), or its broker-dealer, is unable (apes again) to borrow shares to make delivery on the short sale of actual shares, the short sale may result in a fail to deliver position at Trader A‚Äôs clearing firm. Rather than paying the borrowing fee on the shares to make delivery, or unwinding the position by purchasing the shares in the market, Trader A might next enter into a trade that gives the appearance of satisfying the broker-dealer‚Äôs close-out requirement, but in reality allows Trader A to maintain its short position without ever delivering on the short sale. Most often, this is done through the use of a buy-write trade, but may also be done as a married put and may incorporate the use of short term FLEX options. These trades are commonly referred to as ‚Äúreset transactions,‚Äù in that they have the effect of resetting the time that the broker-dealer must purchase or borrow the stock to close-out a fail. The transactions could be designed solely to give the appearance of delivering the shares, when in reality the trader has no intention of meeting his delivery obligations. Such transactions were alleged by the Commission to be sham transactions in recent enforcement cases. Such transactions between traders or any market participants have also been found to constitute a violation of a clearing firm‚Äôs responsibility to close out a failure to deliver.""

It's almost like a play by play of what we've seen (in combination with the ladder attacks). My guess is we'll find out more when the failed to deliver report for the second half of Jan comes out on the 17th.

I 100% think that Melvin is committing massive securities fraud. In fact, I would bet all my money on it - oh wait, I did 96 GME @ 290.

I am now holding on principle to see these fucks fail.

Not a financial adviser, I eat paint chips for dinner

EDIT: Ok, so I've been reading some comments and I wanted to clear a couple things up:

* The failed to deliver number is reported cumulatively. So if you sum everything for the Jan time period it'd come out incorrectly as 5 million. What I'm doing is summing all the *debits* to get an aggregate view of all the failed to delivers in the time range. This process is validated and discussed in other /r/wsb posts

* I know ETF's could have been redeemed by some MM's to gather up GME stock. However I'm not convinced there is enough GME held in ETF's to be a significant factor. Someone in the comments reported this amount to be about ~10M. We would know if a bunch of ETF's rebalanced and dumped GME.

* My number for the Ortex short interest was incorrect, I got mixed around when I wrote this initially. The short interest reported by Ortex on Friday morning was ~80%. The 120 figure for S3 was correct. 

* Please checkout the linked DD - it goes into much more detail and covers things far better than I can. 

* Share this post and the related DD. We need to hold wall street accountable if this is true and I think that starts by spreading the word. 

* I'm going to continue to dig into this tonight / tomorrow. Look forward to a new post tomorrow evening.

>A corner in the silver market has been tried before - and let's be clear, that is what is being attempted now.  In 1980, a rule change by the government destroyed the corner.  #silverthursday.

https://www.britannica.com/topic/Silver-Thursday

>Silver Thursday, the dramatic fall in the price of silver on March 27, 1980, following the Hunt brothers‚Äô attempt to corner the market on the metal.

-
>Apart from a handful of reigning monarchs and despots, Nelson Bunker Hunt (1926‚Äì2014) was the richest man in the world at the start of the 1960s. Like his father, the legendary oilman H. L. Hunt, Bunker gambled big and got lucky. By 1970, although his wealth was accumulating faster than he could spend it, he foresaw a volatile economic future. Prevented by Franklin Roosevelt‚Äôs 1933 prohibition on U.S. citizens owning gold, Bunker and his younger brother William Herbert (b. 1929) chose silver, then standing at $1.50 per ounce, as their speculative hedge. Their initial caution vanished after Colonel Muammar al-Qaddafi nationalized the Bunkers‚Äô Libyan oil fields in 1973. Furious, and paranoid that paper money would soon be worthless, the Hunt brothers then bought futures contracts on 55 million ounces of silver, eventually accumulating an estimated 100 million ounces of the precious metal. But instead of selling the contracts like normal commodity traders, they took delivery of the bullion and chartered three Boeing 707s to air-freight it to Switzerland.

-
>By 1979, they had engineered a genuine shortage of the metal. The Hunts owned $4.5 billion-worth of shiny, glittering silver, safely stashed in Swiss vaults. Still the price climbed, until on January 17, 1980, an ounce cost $49.45. Such rampant speculation and profits triggered new government oversight, prompting the Federal Reserve to suspend trading in silver. The boom was suddenly over, but the Hunts still had to honour contracts to buy at prices over $50. The day the market plunged‚ÄîMarch 27‚Äîsilver fell to $10.80, the metal‚Äôs biggest single collapse. Upon losing some $1.7 billion, prompting Bunker to quip, ‚ÄúA billion dollars isn‚Äôt what it used to be,‚Äù the Hunts had become the (then) greatest debtors in financial history, and though New York banks allowed them $1.1 billion credit towards clearing their obligations, they were personally bankrupted and later convicted of illegally trying to corner the market on the precious metal; the brothers were fined $10 million each, in addition to the millions they owed to the IRS, and banned from future trading on the commodities market. The Hunts had gambled that silver was undervalued, but they failed because they had made the price of silver too attractive for its own good.

-
>To pay off his staggering debt, Bunker was forced to sell off his beloved stable of thoroughbred horses, three of whom were named Extravagant, Goofed, and Overdrawn. William Herbert remained a billionaire into the 21st century. The character of J. R. Ewing in the original TV series Dallas (1978‚Äì91) and the Duke Brothers in the movie Trading Places (1983) all drew inspiration from the Hunt family and their larger-than-life careers and personalities.",1612181291.0

**Why no spike today?**:

First of all, we can‚Äôt know on what day the Squeeze happens / they cover their shorts. 
All we know is it has to happen sooner or later since the hedgefunds are losing millions if not billions EVERY SINGLE DAY THEY DON‚ÄôT COVER.¬†
They use several tactics to delay it, but they can‚Äôt circumvent it.
They‚Äôre bleeding, and all the retail investors holding are slowly sucking the blood out of their fat ugly bodies.

It might take just a few days, or weeks...
But eventually, when they cover, WE retail investors get to set the price.
That‚Äôs why you keep seeing 10k (or 69420$) is not a meme. Because it‚Äôs not.

We also know they‚Äôre down BAD. Why?
Because they‚Äôre attacking us any way they can and wasting millions doing so.

So let‚Äôs see what tactics they are using:

**Short ladder attacks**:

What is a short ladder attack? 
The big hedgefunds are putting in lower and lower bid prices between themselves. There is little to no volume on those trades, and since no one can buy, it ""looks"" like the stock is plummeting. It‚Äôs only effective if we would sell.

**Infiltrating WSB and other social media**:

Here are some random screenshots I took of WSB Synth. Notice the people saying to jump ship and to take GME gains and invest into FORD. Obvious shills. There‚Äôs tons of them. Always new, or old accounts that suddenly post again. All those people came in just in time when the short ladder attacks started, just to make it look like people are panic selling and convince us to sell:

Here are some News channels caught lying / manipulating the market: (SEC if you read this...)

Now let‚Äôs get some clarification on **SILVER:**

There is so much misinformation swirling around concerning Silver. People don‚Äôt seem to realize 3 things:

1. **Silver is not a get rich quick move. Silver is a LONG TERM HOLD move.** GME is a risky short term play. So YOU decide what makes more sense to get in right now. (Personally I sold all my stocks to buy GME today. YOLO)¬†
2. The actual Silver sub on reddit does not advocate buying SLV, nor do most of them believe SLV is the move to make.¬†
3. The hedge funds would love for you to go all-in on Silver and ignore the GME opportunity. Every dollar spent on SLV instead of GME is a double win for them, since SLV is inverting GME and they own a ton of Silver and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre pushing this narrative in the media.¬†

SLV inverting GME: 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la4mog/stop_buying_slv_you_smooth_brained_retards_its/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

The amount of paper contracts or IShares SLV available is basically infinite. Physical silver is a rare physical commodity with a finite supply, and a very low supply of retail sized bars/rounds/coins.

**IF** you want to go into silver for whatever reason, buy physical. But that‚Äôs just my retard opinion. 

**SILVER ISN‚ÄôT ‚ÄúREDDITS NEXT BIG PLAY‚Äú.** You guys need to realize the GME situation is very unique and WSB is not, and never was about starting crazy short squeezes. GME is a rare opportunity where the big guys actually fucked up BIG TIME.

Well. Let‚Äôs see to what extend they fucked up exactly:¬†

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

Long version here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

**At these levels it‚Äôs NOT about the price, it‚Äôs about the number of shares in the hedgefunds possession. That‚Äôs why they want you to sell so bad.**

In fact, I bought some $GME puts (which I've since sold since somehow they've gone up based on volatility) betting against the crowd here.

However, what has started as a decentralized short squeeze has morphed into a class movement. I'm a big populist and think we need big changes in this country, especially a transfer of wealth and power from the elites to the people. When this morphed into a class movement I became obsessed. However, I still wasn't going to buy in because I shy away from speculating on ultra risky stuff like this. But when Robinhood and all the other major brokerages colluded to cause a massive sell off, that's when it became a matter of principle. I've watched all day as the stock has remained relatively stable on very little volume.

Robinhood and other shitty brokerages are allowing us to buy 2, 5, or very low numbers of GME. However, they are allowing option contracts.

Here‚Äôs a trick that ~~will work.~~

**Update Feb 1 [Loophole Closed](https://www.reddit.com/r/ClassActionRobinHood/comments/la6sll/rh_blocks_exercising_of_gme_call_options/?utm_source=adioking&utm_medium=your_mom&utm_name=golden_fuckboy) **

1) Go to next nearest option expiration (Feb 5 as of today).
2) Scroll all the way down the call list.
3) Buy GME call option with the lowest +x.xx% (0% would be no premium at mark).
4) Immediately exercise.

I just exercised 2 contracts and now have 200 shares, blocking the shorts. You can repeat this process over and over if you are buying a lot.

Best of luck out there! Let‚Äôs get them!!!

P.S. ~~If you can afford 100 shares but can‚Äôt afford the risk, you can sell (heh...) some shares after you exercise and take risk off the table.~~

_Update:_ A screenshot has made it to me that Robinhood is blocking same day exercise so you would need to carry into the next trading day to exercise.

_This is NOT financial advice and is for informational purposes ONLY. You can lose 100% of anything you invest._

EDIT:

1) This works for pretty much any stock.

2) There‚Äôs a catch. You need enough money (please don‚Äôt use margin) to cover 100 shares. The way exercising works is you pay for the 100 shares at the strike price.

Example:

- $GME is $300
- The 2/5 $50c is $250 so it costs $25,000
- Cost to exercise would be $50 x 100 ($5000).
- Total cost: $30,000 (same as buying 100 shares)

After exercising you could then sell shares at open market and de-risk if you like and hold the remainder.",1611951445.0

In 2008 the banks held risky assets and got bailed out because they said the innocent normal people would be hurt even more if you didn‚Äôt bail them out, so the government did it.

We posed a risk to the liquidity of the hedge funds, brokers, and clearinghouses yesterday.  By bankrupting them it would probably cause a temporary stock market crash as they liquidate their positions.

Are we not now in the same position as the banks were in 2008?  Buy us out of our positions for $700 billion to save the rest of the market and the normal people right?

Edit because it got attention:  if this ever was a reality it would in the form of a loan to clearinghouses and brokers to cover any losses up to $10k per share.  They would have to pay it back over time.  The government would get the money back and reimburse taxpayers, while at the same time collecting taxes from the gains of the retail investors. Long term the clearinghouses and brokers recover, the market continues to function,  and then they never let hedge funds put on a risky play like that ever again.

I can see comments of single mother putting her life savings in and college kids borrowing money at a very high interest and going all in.

This is not a joke. Losing money is not a joke. If you get a loan and buy a stock, you are at a risk. Only buy with money that you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings or retirement corpus on this. 
For people who are getting emotional and going all in against the hedge funds, the hedge funds will have a small scratch and you would be destroyed in the end. The concept of YOLO with buying stocks works only till you don't go bankrupt.

I know this sub is now filled with a lot of new people telling you to buy the dip. Don't get emotional with money. This sub is for people who like to invest money that they can afford to lose, and not your life's savings when you are a single mother.

I know Ill get downvoted to oblivion saying a statement like this, when the whole sub would be filled with ""to the moon üöÄ""
But please don't put in money you can't afford. Don't get loans and buy stocks. Money ain't coming easy and all the money you lost is earned by the hedge funds you wanted to destory in the first place.

Edit 1 : I dint expect this post to blow up. I honestly thought it would be downvoted to oblivion. But thanks folks. And I am not paper handed, still holding to the 1 stock I bought. I'll take it to the end.

268,30 Seconds From Triggering Market Nuclear Bomb,68591,l7bpf5,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/,7891,"I'm glad this place has quieted down enough for some actual DD written by a monkey with a keyboard and Adderall.  

Disclaimer: I am that monkey.  Let me explain to you what happened, play by play.  I will give you illiterates who hate reading a spoiler up front: 

__We were within approximately 30 seconds of triggering a nuclear bomb that would have blown up the market.__ Do I have your attention?  Here goes:

1.	‚Å†Yesterday, new call option strike prices were added all the way up to $570.  Do I have to go over gamma squeezes again?  Really?  We've been over this: when deep out-of-the-money call options start being gobbled up and the price starts moving towards being in-the-money, the call writers have to hedge their risk of having their sold calls exercised, typically by buying stock.  This creates upwards pressure on the market.  We've been seeing these movements all week.
2.	‚Å†Yesterday after market, you probably saw that coordinated effort to drive the price down and spook retail investors into a mass sell-off.  It didn't work.
3.	‚Å†Last night, Robinhood sent out a message to users: you could no longer enter into new options.  You could exercise them if you had the collateral (money in the account) to do so.  Very interesting and the first sign of pants-shitting fear.
4.	‚Å†Today, the market opened very strong.  It opened so strong that we were looking at a self-perpetuating gamma squeeze all the way up way past $570.
5.	‚Å†At approximately 9:58 am, the stock had reached $468 in a parabolic move.
6.	‚Å†Two minutes earlier, at 9:56 am, Robinhood tweeted that they were not allowing users to buy GME stock, but they would allow selling.
7.	‚Å†The trend instantly halted and started a collapse downwards, before picking up a bit, especially after some retail was allowed back in.

Okay, now that you are clear on the facts, understand this: The market ran out of liquidity today, or was threatening to get close enough that they killed it.  What does that mean?  It means they ran out of shares and/or capital. They wouldn't let you buy new shares because we were burning through all the shares on the market.  

__I saw an unsubstantiated post from a user ([u/zshub](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7bpf5/30_seconds_from_triggering_market_nuclear_bomb/gl5vgof/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf&amp;context=3)) who said a market sell order executed at $2600 for him.  Also, someone else for over [$5,000](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7em07/coworker_had_a_limit_executed_of_a_little_over/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) per share. Do you get the severity of the situation, if that's true?__ It means the buying was getting to the point where it was just about to put INFINITE pressure on the price of the shares.  It means virtually any ask was getting bid.

How do you get infinite upwards pressure?  A gamma squeeze triggering the mother of all short squeezes, just like we predicted.  The call writers need shares to hedge.  Retail is still buying more.  The short sellers need over 100% of the float back.  Add these together.  There were more shares needed than existed on the open market.  That's what a liquidity crisis is.

[Listen to this ](https://youtu.be/7RH4XKP55fM)to this remarkable (if infuriating) interview where the chairman of Interactive Brokers admits that they didn't have the capital to pay out the winners (us), so they took their ball and went home.  DO YOU GRASP HOW INSANE IT IS THAT HE SAID THEY NEEDED TO SHUT DOWN BUY ORDERS TO ""PROTECT THE MARKET""? Hello!  He's not talking about the market for GME shares.  He's talking about the entire market!  The New York Stock Exchange.  The NASDAQ.  All that.

Remember the movie Snowpiercer?  Do you remember that scene where the lower class people realize the soldiers who oppress them have no bullets?  Go to the 1:00 minute mark of this link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EH1EtiOhr6o

It kick starts a full blown rebellion.  They have no bullets.  It's the exact same in this market:  No capital.  No shares.  Infinite losses inbound.

__TL;DR: For all you who will just skip to the bottom to ask, ""Do I get my tendies now?"" the answer is this: they NEED NEED NEED your shares.  Do you get that?  HOLD.  Like the guy in the movie, scream, ""They're out of bullets!"" and create a stampede.  That's how we win.__

Edit 02/04 #2: [We did it Reddit](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lcvluc/an_update_on_the_wsb_coup_d%C3%A9tat/)! 


tl;dr on tl;dr: Founder bad, greedy, got banned for being greedy. Being greedy again with new spotlight on the sub. 

tl;dr, in 2020 the original founder (after being gone for years and did nothing to contribute to the sub), along with a couple of mods, attempted to monetize the sub for personal gains. Users and other mods fought back. Hundreds of users got mass banned for speaking out, mods who spoke out got removed as mods. With some help from users, mods found precedent of another sub creator getting banned for trying to monetize a sub and sent plea to Reddit admins. Reddit admins banned offenders and gave sub back to the good mods. 

u/SpeaksInBooleans (RIP) investigated the circumstance of the events and made video exposing the offenders:

[Mega thread after the victory](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fx5zwf/ladies_and_gentlemen_we_got_him/) for reference. 

It's important to know/remember this now, because the same person that got exiled for being a tyrant is doing a media circus, trying to ride the current spotlight for personal gain, again. Hey CNN and WSJ, stop interviewing that dipshit. The sub has always been about its people, and what you guys wanted to do (as retarded as you are). No single person speaks for the sub and controls its destiny. It is in good hands with u/zjz aka u/SwineFluPandemic

Edit: He is spreading complete lies about the sub and the mods that got him removed:

>	Despite being its founder, Rogozinski was kicked out of the forum in April for trying to eliminate the hate speech plaguing the community.

>‚ÄúThere were a handful of mods who were straight up white supremacists,‚Äù he said.

I haven't ordered anything so the first thing I thought was maybe someone got a hold of my account number or personal info and changed it. I immediately logged in to check out my plan and make sure everything was in order. I had a notification that showed that [AT&T had ""upgraded my internet speed at no extra charge""](https://imgur.com/LrUUetX)

Obviously I was annoyed by this, so I dug a little deeper to figure out why the bill had changed. I then found this alert showing that the ""promotional discount"" for this so-called [""customer loyalty speed upgrade""](https://imgur.com/PtYazt6) would expire in a month and my bill would go up $20 more per month. 

I then looked at my bill and found that they had [upgraded my plan to the highest speed and most expensive plan they have without my consent](https://imgur.com/ThJwB7J), under the guise of ""customer loyalty"", and applied a $20/month promotional rate for 1 month to make it look like my plan hadn't changed and the new bill was probably just some random $5 fee added on like most ISPs occasionally do. 

I immediately called and spoke to a rep named Jorge who stated that it was a mistake, that the change was applied automatically and it wasn't supposed to be applied to my account, but after telling him if it was automatic it needed to be addressed immediately because it was probably affecting other people, he confessed that AT&T was aware of it and that they had received many calls about it. I don't for one second believe this was accidental. I believe they are doing it on purpose and hoping that many people won't notice.

Make sure you watch your bills, because if this happened to me it is almost certainly happening to others. I'm not sure what should be done about it (if anything) and I don't personally care at this point because the issue is resolved for me, but I do feel like AT&T should be outed for this shady behavior and that someone should be held responsible, so I wanted to post to show everyone what happened. If this is the wrong place to post, please suggest a better sub. This was just the closest thing I could think of that applied and it could be shared/crossposted from here.

**Edit:** since there were a couple questions about my last login, the 2015 date is inaccurate. I usually log in from my phone but did it via my computer this time so I could make the post easier w/ images etc. Not sure why it's showing 2015 as my last login as I'm pretty sure I didn't even have AT&T then lol ... anyway, [here's the email I received, dated 12/30/17, so this is definitely a current thing](https://i.imgur.com/I7W1VpU.png)

**Edit 2:** Since this is getting a good amount of attention, if this happens to you here's what I did: You should immediately pause your autopay if you have it so the bill doesn't get paid (note that I got this email 12/30/17, two days before the bill was due on 1/1/18, so they definitely tried to sneak it by me). Then call them and they should credit your current bill back to your normal rate, you should pay that month's bill manually, then let autopay resume. As others have noted in the comments ALWAYS WATCH YOUR BILL CLOSELY!

**Edit 4:** Holy moly this thread has picked up some steam! Thanks anonymous Reddit friend for popping my golden cherry!

**One last edit:** from a PM I received...the sender wanted to remain anonymous but I thought this was great info: 

>I work in big telcom. What you experienced is called a ‚Äúslam sale‚Äù in the industry. It‚Äôs when a salesman places an order for you, without ever receiving your approval for the order. The salesman gets credit for the sale, meets quota or receives a big bonus. 

>Oddly enough, this is not a very common tactic today. It was popular until 10 years ago, and it‚Äôs almost unheard of today. I wasn‚Äôt aware that AT&T was experiencing Slam Sales today. 

>You can protect your account from Slam Sales. All the major telco providers will offer authentication-secure account protection. Call AT&T, ask for billing, and tell the rep that you want to password-protect your account from unauthorized sales. You can setup either a password or a PIN that must be entered to make any account changes. 

>Sorry this happened to you.

And another PM:

>I also work for a major telco as well(name is somewhat synonymous with dicks), the account PIN/Password is visible to us when we do verification and would not stop someone from putting sales on random accounts. Pretty much every ISP and cable company uses outdated billing software from the 80's that's a glorified AS400 mainframe running with a 90's era gui overlay.

Hi Gary I have read many articles similar to Yours in the past day that reddit users are behind this silver push. I'm sorry to say this is not the case. I understand you implied that according to CNBC reports it isn't understood whether it is longtime reddit users or perhaps larger organisations at play here. I don't consider myself a long time user but I joined the community at a mere 1.8m members. That number in the few months I have been a wallstreetbets member has ballooned to 8milion+. I would urge you to check out the site and see for yourself the overwhelming sentiment that silver is simply a distraction. We love GME stock, we are not bored of it and the due diligence shows evidence that an extraordinary short interest DOES still exist for it. It would be wonderful to see a detailed article on this and I'm CERTAIN this would attract a lot more attention and clicks than another WSB LOVES SLV article. I'm not trying to demean your work in any way. 
Hope you have nice day, all the best.

Edit - I've had quite a lot of messages concerning WSB's interest in silver dating back from long ago, long before I was a member so I just wanted to clarify something. 
Here is a clarification : 
I wanted to reflect the disparity between how few silver posts I was seeing on wsb in and around the time of the media hype and how so many media outlets were pushing the "" WSB's next target is silver!"" agenda. Of course this community is so big that there must be lots of diversity and it was a little ham-fisted to suggest nobody on the sub is buying silver. The important point in my mind was that MSM as I saw it had blanket reported something about the subreddit I believed was an inaccurate representation of the real sentiment.",1612353619.0

However, the whole time I was a little puzzled with how severe the reactions from Wall Street have been, especially this week. ""The company had more than 100% of its stock sold short! That's never happened before!"", you say. I know, I know, but that's [not actually not a new thing](https://www.forbes.com/2006/08/25/naked-shorts-global-links-cx_lm_0825naked.html?sh=f59ff078400b). A short squeeze, even one of this magnitude, should have squoze by now with GME up more than 10x in the span of weeks. Something is just not right. **I think there is something much, much bigger going on here. Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**

Here is my hypothesis: I think the hedge funds, clearing houses, and DTC executed a coordinated effort to put Game Stop out of business by conspiring to create a gargantuan number of counterfeit shares of GME, possibly 100-200% or more of the shares originally issued by Game Stop. In the process, they may have accidentally created a bomb that could blow up the entire system as we know it and we're seeing their efforts to cover this up unfold now. What is that bomb? **I believe retail investors may hold more than 100% of GME** (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company). This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

For you to follow this argument, you need to go read the white paper [""Counterfeiting Stock 2.0""](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CS2.0/CounterfeitingStock.html) so you understand how the hedge funds can create fake stock out of thin air and disguise it so it looks like real shares. They use these fake shares in [short attacks to drive the price of a company down until they put them into bankruptcy](https://seekingalpha-com.cdn.ampproject.org/v/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/11442671-gerald-klein/3096735-anatomy-of-a-short-attack?amp_js_v=a6&amp_gsa=1&usqp=mq331AQHKAFQArABIA%3D%3D). This practice seems to be widespread among hedge funds that go short. There is even a term for it, ""strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver."" Counterfeiting shares is extremely illegal (similar level to counterfeiting money) but it's very difficult to prove and even getting the court to approve subpoenas because of the way the financial industry has stacked the deck against investigations.

This completely explains why so many levels of the financial system seem to be actively trying to get in the way of retail investors purchasing more GME. It's not just about a short squeeze, it's about their firms' very existence and their own personal freedom. We have the opportunity to put all these people in jail by proving that we own more than 100% of shares in existence.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via [13F filings](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) that they own more than **102,000,000 shares** (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen). Now, I don't know the delay/variance on these ownership numbers, but I think there is a pretty solid argument that close to 100% of GME is owned by these firms, if not more.

Moreover, there are now more than 7 million people subscribed to r/wallstreetbets\~\~. I know lots of people here are sitting on a few hundred shares that they bought back when it was under $50. Some of us are even holding thousands. If the average number of shares owned by each subscriber is even close to 5-10, we have a very good shot at also owning a similarly enormous amount of GME.\~\~ **Even if the average was just 10 shares per legit subscriber, that puts the minimum retail position at about 30-50% of the entire company.**

GME has been on the NYSE threshold list for almost a month. We don't have January data yet, but I just analyzed the data from the [SEC's fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver list for December](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm) (all 65,871 lines of it) and looked up the number of shares that were likely counterfeit. For comparison, I did the same for a couple random tickers. Most companies have close to no shares not show up. Of those that do, it's a relatively small number of shares. For example, two random companies: Lowes ($LOW, \~$125B market cap) had 13,960 shares fail to be delivered at its highest point that month, Boston Beer Company ($SAM, $11.5B market cap) had 295 shares fail to be delivered.

How many shares of GME failed to deliver? **1,787,191.** As the white papers points out, the true number of counterfeit shares can be 20x this number. How bad do you think that number will be when we get the numbers for January? I'm willing to bet its many times that. Look at how that compares to other companies' stock:

[Histogram showing number of shares that weren't delivered in December \(x-axis\) vs the number of companies that fall into that bin \(y-axis\). GME is an extreme outlier.](https://preview.redd.it/g723jvyhine61.png?width=445&format=png&auto=webp&s=39bad6c47b428d364de36e9888de35b79572d1da)

I think this explains all the shenanigans going on the last few days. There is way too much counterfeit GME stock out there and DTC, the clearing houses, and the hedge funds are all in on it. That's why there has been such a coordinated effort to disrupt our ability to buy shares. **No real shares can be found** **and it's about to cause the system to fall apart.**

*TLDR; We probably own way more of GME than we think and that is freaking out Wall Street because it could prove they've been up to some extremely illegal shit and the whole system could implode as a result.*

EDIT 0: Looks like I truly belong on this sub. On the first version of this post I didn't read the file description properly and summed a cumulative distribution. My numbers were wrong, but I have updated the plot and post with the correct numbers.

EDIT 1: You should also note this is the distribution for NASDAQ tickers, not the entire NYSE. I doubt that the distribution trend is any different though.

EDIT 2: Evidence that Fannie May and Freddie Mac were killed in 2008 via short attacks using counterfeit shares: [report](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf). Exactly what I think they were trying to do to GME.

EDIT 3: A lot of people were hung up on the ""3 shares per wsb subscriber thing"". I know many accounts are bots, I was intentionally underestimating that number. I have adjusted to 10 shares per ""legit subscriber"" to reflect this without changing the total amount I think retail owns.

EDIT 4: What I'm seeing on Twitter makes me think I'm being interpreted a little too hyperbolically when I say ""Something big enough to blow up the entire financial system.**"" We're not going to go back to mud huts, people.** This could just be really disruptive for a short amount of time and cause a number of firms to face liquidity problems, possibly bankrupting some of them. Life will go on and I'm confident regulators and government will step in and protect people if necessary. Hopefully they pay more attention to enforcing securities laws going forward to prevent this from happening again.

EDIT 6: I am getting thousands of messages. I won't be able to respond to all of them. Here is an FAQ:

1. *How do I learn investing?*I am not an authority on this, but my personal opinion is to first learn how to read a company's financial documents and value businesses and only then start thinking about putting your money into specific stocks. Read ""the intelligent investor"" by Benjamin Graham for this. Then learn how to think about picking stocks. I like Peter Lynch's books for this.
2. *What is going to happen this week?*I have no idea and I wouldn't dare to guess.
3. *Are you going to be killed?*I don't know where people are getting this idea. I have no special knowledge or insider contacts, and I am in no way, shape, or form an expert on the market or the system behind it. Please treat my tinfoil-hat conspiracy theories as just that. There is nothing to gain from harming me and I have no doubts about my safety. These are just personal opinions and I don't have any schemes to ""take down the shorts"" or anything like that. I do not advocate for you to buy, hold, or sell. I'm just postulating on how we might have found ourselves in this place.",1612080630.0

My previous post got removed by the compromised mods of r/wallstreetbets
  
  
[I have access to Bloomberg Terminal with up to date data as of February 5 on institutional holdings. Institutions currently hold 177% of the float!](https://i.redd.it/c44cmb67mtf61.png)  
  
  
[How is this even possible to own more than 100% of the float?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/07/institutional_holdings.asp) Here's an example of one of the most likely causes of distorted institutional holdings percentages. Let's assume Company XYZ has 20 million shares outstanding and Institution A owns all 20 million. In a shorting transaction, institution B borrows five million of these shares from Institution A, then sells them to Institution C. If both A and C claim ownership of the shares shorted by B, the institutional ownership of Company XYZ could be reported as 25 million shares (20 + 5)‚Äîor 125% (25 √∑ 20). In this case, institutional holdings may be incorrectly reported as more than 100%.  
  
  
In cases where reported institutional ownership exceeds 100%, actual institutional ownership would need to already be very high. While somewhat imprecise, arriving at this conclusion helps investors to determine the degree of the potential impact that institutional purchases and sales could have on a company's stock overall.  
   
  
I have plausible evidence that leads me to believe there are still shorts who have not covered, and there are also shorts who entered greedily at prices that could still trigger a short squeeze event as this knife has been falling. [~1 million shares of GME were borrowed this Friday at 10 am, and a short attack occured that dropped GME from $95 to $70 over the course of 15 minutes.](https://i.redd.it/97j13bxy4pf61.jpg)  
  
  
[This is my source for live borrowed shares data that you can watch during market hours.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)  

So we still meet the first requirement for a short squeeze to even be possible, there ARE a lot of short positions taken in GME still. The ultimate question is will there be enough demand to drown the supply? Or are we going to let the wolf in sheep's clothing aka Citadel who we know is behind not only these short positions bailing them out and purchasing puts themselves (data from 9/30/20) , but behind many brokerages who ultimately manipulated the supply demand chain by removing buying...are we really going to just let this happen? What they did last Thursday was straight up criminal.   
  
  
Institutions move the markets more than retailers unfortunately, especially when order flows go directly through Citadel. [But it is very interesting the amount of OTM calls weeks out compared to puts. This is options expiring 3/12/21, and all the earlier expiration dates are also heavy in OTM calls.](https://i.imgur.com/mv0bo4Y.png) Max pain theory states it is in the market maker's best interest (those who write options aka theta gang) for price to gravitate towards max pain, as the strike price with the most open contracts including puts and calls would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.  
  
  
With this heavy volume abundant in OTM calls, a gamma squeeze can occur if we can get the market makers to hedge against their options. [Look what triggered the explosive movement as price blasted past the max pain strike last week, I believe this caused many bears to have to take a long position as a way to hedge against their losses.](https://i.imgur.com/NHZg0O6.png) And right now, we are very close and gravitating towards max pain strike. If there is a catalyst/company event that can cause demand to increase, I believe GME is not dead for all the aforementioned reasons above.

I am calling on you today, pursuant to 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i, titled Manipulation of Security Prices, to prohibit manipulative and deceptive tactics that artificially depresses the price of GME and AMC securities in contravention of the laws of the United States. 

Section 78i(a) clearly states that ""It shall be unlawful for any person, directly or indirectly, by the use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce, or of any facility of any national securities exchange, or for any member  of a national securities exchange -- **(2)**  To effect, alone or with 1 or more other persons, *a series of transactions* in any security registered on a national securities  exchange, any security not so registered, or *in connection with any security-based swap or security-based swap agreement* with respect to such security creating actual or apparent active trading in such  security, or **raising or depressing the price of such security, for the purpose of inducing the purchase or sale of such security by others.""**

Currently, GME and AMC stock prices are actively being manipulated using a mechanism called ""short ladder attacks"" to depress the price of these stocks in contravention of 15 U.S.C.A. ¬ß 78i. ""Short ladder attacks"" occur when large institutions in possession of the aforementioned stocks sell them for just less than market value in rapid succession between one another in order to drive the price down. The fact that short ladder attacks exist is apparent from on-going market activity that can be seen here

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l71yxn/ladder_selling_explained/

check this out

Such blatant attacks readily establishes prima facie case of market manipulation and must be investigated by the SEC immediately. Further silence from the SEC on this matter, which can be investigated quite quickly, not only encourages further market manipulation but also further diminishes public trust and faith in the U.S. Government.

Finally, section 78i(f) makes it clear that ""Any person who willfully participates in any act or transaction in  violation of subsections (a), (b), or (c) of this section, **shall** be liable to any person who shall purchase or sell any security at a price  which was affected by such act or transaction.""  


I am calling on you to do your job. The direct manipulation of GME and AMC stock prices is an on-going crisis that directly hurts the public interest and is AGAINST THE LAW. You must act now before it is too late.

Sincerely,

Your Average Retail Investor

This is a community of full blown first class true tits up degenerates which take pleasure in posting losses accumulating into the millions every fucking month and you are putting your money into a BET ‚Äì yes my dear it is written out in the name of this very fucking sub Wallstreet-B-E-T-S!!! ‚Äì and follow DD posted by people with names like ‚ÄûSHOW\_ME\_YOUR\_ANAL\_TITS‚Äú? You realize this is not a fucking Disney ferry ‚ÄûOne-Wish-comes-true‚Äú show and we see all day long gain porn and loss porn is something which doesn‚Äôt exist in this world? This is a band of true autists which occupied an absolute niche when it comes down to trading (and we even don‚Äôt trade stocks normally!). This is the place where one wants to enjoy the sado-masochistic part of the retarded capitalistic system we are living in. Yes we have some (maybe a lot) DD diamonds in this sub which by the way are now impossible to find because you degenerate fucks spam the entire system to the moon but no sane long-term investor would consider to invest into any of these investments ‚Äì this is about ‚Äûget rich or die trying!‚Äú. This is not r/investing!

**2) Yeah but I saw Reddit in the news and all that stuff about GME and it was going through the roof becasue there is going to be short squeeze and on top of it the hedge funds fucked up, hihihi**

If this entire thing was a safe bet why exactly would not the fucking entire world jump on this train? (and even you might get this image from all this ‚ÄûSaudi Arabia calling, China calling, Africa calling posts ‚Äì but please they invest into BABA, Aramco or I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs the hot shit in Lagos stock exchange right now ‚Äì could be though the next big thing ‚Äì got to see if I can find a DD on this). So why is this not happening? Because it is a fucking BET ‚Äì the stock market is a fucking Casino and the major difference between r/investing and us is that they are always just bet on black or red, while we always go for the magical zero. It is totally unclear whether all of us going to show up at Miami Beach with our Porsche Cayenne or Tesla Model S and hit on the girls (or boys) on the beach! The reasons are layed out to you every fucking day with yet another quality DD that most of us simply dont understand! And yes our chances to already sit on the fucking moon slurping our Pinha Coladas would be certainly higher if everything was going the way we believe the system should be working but even the last person who joined this sub by now should realize ‚Äì you are potentially fucking with the system itself (by the way something this sub never intentionally wanted and you shouldn‚Äôt do if you like the system).

**3) Hey but when is the squeeze of the squoze going to happen? üòì**

So there is this story going through the media and from Florida to Colorado everybody remotely degenerate is yoloing money into GME. It‚Äôs a fucking global movement now (or not ‚Äì could be also the same 50.000 degenerates cheering up themselves the entire time which would much better fit this place) and according to the DD we just need to have üôåüíéand the shorts a bleeding their panties, their balls feel squozen (and not in a good way) and they are completely in defensive mode. What do you think what people who are responsible for Multi-billion $$$ HF are going to do? How do you think you become a person who is responsible for such an operation? Do you think these guys have served as altar boys or girls in church (no offense if so)? What is wrong with you? Seriously! Do you think if they get some headwind they are going to say: Oh boy ‚Äì we got defeated and going to realize a multi-fucking-billion-to-the-moon loss? **OF COURSE FUCKING NOT!** **THEY WILL GET EVERY FUCKING BAZOOKA, TANK, ROCKET or INTER-STELLAR DEFENSE SYSTEM IN PLACE TO BRING THIS TO AN END!** Influence the market participants (speculation), Short-Laddar attacks (I to this very day haven‚Äôt understand the concept or how this works ‚Äì speculation), demotivational tactics (speculation) and to whomever picks it up ‚Äì desinformation (well not quite speculation but it could also be that media is just retarded as fuck to get the most simple facts straight). So what would you do with a potential group of 5mn small-size investors ‚Äì shall we do a collective effort to think about it? Ah fuck it! It is to fucking obvious ‚Äì you would dry this out through time, divide their interests and drive away their attention. Because let‚Äôs be fucking honest ‚Äì most of you entered this thinking you would hold this wonderful stock for a couple of days (and to be honest in this respect the community how it existed 10 days ago was much more true to itself - no whining just sayin)! Gotcha! Who can tell me who fucked each other two weeks ago in People magazin or on Twitter? Nobody ‚Äì I even don‚Äôt remember shit about this very forum before GME (ok I remember u/variation-separate but that is another story). And all their tactics are completely understandable because there is a fucking huge amount of tendies to be made and they are not that different from us (my fear).

**4) That does not give you the fucking right to whine and bitch all the time in the daily threads (and it is not happening already its going to be) and fucking ruin the party**

Deal with it ‚Äì we just got to wait how this thing plays out. That‚Äôs it. If we are right ‚Äì this will play out positively in one or another way (huge tendies or SEC investigating). Let them continue shorting the stock or whatever. If you believe you want to buy more stock ‚Äì do your DD and do it. When this got picked up a long time ago by people they thought ‚Äì hmmmm makes sense ‚Äì I am going to get me one of these tickets to the moon. There was if at all a very little interest to squoze the balls of any HF and it was certainly not the main motivation of this sub. I said it above: Get rich or die tryin! Since last Thursday the whole thing became political and it looks like rules were changed in our disfavour and yeah we can not go back in time but we got to deal with it and the circumstances. \[Left out this part as it promotes holding and buying which I don‚Äôt want to in the sense that everybody needs to make his own fucking decision but I am going to fucking hold\] but **WE NEED TO REGAIN OUR POSITIVE SPIRIT** which was an essential part of this sub and GME for most part in January (and of course in general before) ‚Äì no matter how fucked up things looked (individually as there is not such a thing as collective alignment to buy options or stocks on this forum). We will see how the numbers are play out and who provided the adequate picture. In our reality GME is going to the moon and the üöÄ is fueled. Period. We are just prevented from starting because of the windy conditions out there.

So please ‚Äì no post without üôåüíéüôåüíéüôåüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ and if you want to fukn leave the party ‚Äì leave ‚Äì but let us continue this party, because we are going to the fkn moon. This is the way and I fkn love GME and if this means I need to hold onto this beauty for another 25 years I am going to do it.

P.S.: One thing dear to my heart - in the past there has been huge donations made by this community to people living with autism. As we use their names every fkn day I would really like to see some of your degenerates not to forget about this cause because we owe them and as much as I like the billboards I‚Äôd rather see every $$$ go into charities rather then telling the world about us  ‚Äì I think everybody out there knows by now that we exist and that we have üôåüíé

>With stiff sentences for 21 conspirators last week in the United States and a round of indictments in India, the Justice Department says it has broken up what appeared to be the nation‚Äôs first large-scale, multinational telephone fraud operation.

>Over four years, more than 15,000 victims in the United States lost ‚Äúhundreds of millions‚Äù of dollars to the sophisticated scam, and more than 50,000 individuals had their personal information misused, the department said Friday. The money was routed through call centers in India back to the ringleaders in eight states.

>The fraudulent calls came suddenly and frequently while the scam was active from 2012 to 2016, according to court documents. A person posing as an Internal Revenue Service or immigration official was on the phone, threatening arrest, deportation or other penalties if the victims did not immediately pay their debts with prepaid cards or wire transfers.

>In an announcement on Friday, the department said 21 people living in eight states ‚Äî Illinois, Arizona, Florida, California, Alabama, New Jersey and Texas ‚Äî were sentenced last week in Houston to prison for up to 20 years for their role in the scheme.

>In addition, 32 contractors in India involving five call centers in Ahmedabad, a city in western India, have been indicted on wire fraud, money laundering and other conspiracy charges as part of the operation, the department said.

As always, remain vigilant about supposed IRS claims, and never accept or believe any calls from people purporting to be the IRS. The IRS never demands immediate payment (e.g. wire transfers or gift cards), or threatens to bring in the police, immigration officers or other law-enforcement. Communication always begins over snail mail. Hopefully these arrests will serve as a warning to others trying to prey on vulnerable populations. ",1532374096.0

1987: Big Stuf Oreo released. Black Monday, a 20% single-day crash and a following bear market.

Let's call him Melvin. He thinks he's really smart. He finds a coupon for $20 off the new Nintendo Switch during the holidays with no limit on number of units. This is easy. I'll go ahead and sell the Switch now for $200 and then buy it for $180 with the coupon. Easiest $20 I'll ever make. He goes and tells all his parents' friends at the Citadel Country Club that he can get them the new Nintendo Switch for their kids. He collects $200 each from 150 parents. He now has $30K and will use that money to purchase Nintendo Switches for $27K. He'll have earned $3K in just a few hours. His parents will be so proud.

There's another kid watching Melvin this entire time. Let's call him Keith. Keith doesn't like Melvin. Keith is good friends with the guys over at Gamestop. He finds out that there are were only 100 new Switches shipped to the entire country. Keith and his 99 friends buy all 100 Nintendo Switches on the spot.

Later in the day, Melvin goes to Gamestop with his $20 off coupon and says, ""I'll take 150 Nintendo Switches please."" Gamestop guy looks at him and says, ""Sorry, we're all sold out."" Melvin goes to the next Gamestop. Same story. All sold out. He goes to all the Gamestops in the city and can't find a single Switch. He won't be able to fulfill the orders.

Meanwhile, Keith is telling all his friends about what Melvin promised the members at the Country Club. Nobody sell him the Nintendo Switch that you bought, no matter how much he offers you. Nobody likes Melvin, so everybody holds on to their Nintendo Switch.

Melvin is in trouble. His parents rich friends are all asking when they are getting their Nintendo Switch. Melvins parents are angry, but they don't want to lose their standing in the Citadel Country Club. They have to help Melvin gets 150 Nintendo Switches. Now remember there are only 100 Switches in the city, but Melvin has created the expectation among the parents that there are 150. This is how you get a short percentage over 100%. Melvin has promised more than actually exist.

The price of Nintendo Switches in the city skyrockets. Melvins parents were able to get a few units from Keiths friends, but they had to pay really inflated prices for them, first $1,000, then $2,000, now $3,000. It's nearing Christmas, and every rich parent at the Country Club is desperate for the Nintendo Switch they promised their kids. They can't trust that Melvin will be able to get them one. They all start bidding against each other for Switches. Everybody in town is in on the action now. Everybody wants to get a Nintendo Switch to sell at the country club for $10,000. Meanwhile, Keith and his friends are just hanging out and playing Animal Crossing.

\[Edit 1: Thanks for all the love and awards. I'm really grateful. I'll try to answer as many question as I can on the thread and in the DM's\]

\[Edit 2: A few astute monkeys have pointed out some flaws in my story. The example above is an oversimplification and I left a few important elements. So here's an expanded version and I've had to adjust some of the numbers above to make room for new wrinkles.

In a more accurate version, Melvin went to his brother Steve's high school and borrowed 150 Nintendo Switches from the high schoolers. He tells them all that if he doesn't give them back within 24 hours, he will give them each $5 per day. The high schoolers know that it's not likely that Melvin will give it back in 24 hours, so they will be perfectly happy to collect $5 per day. He sells the 150 Switches to the Country Club parents for $200 each, but now he owes 150 Switches to the high schoolers. This is a naked short. He sold Switches that were borrowed but didn't own. Let's assume the Country Club parents wrapped the Switches and they are now under the tree and out of circulation. Although there are 250 Switches in the city, there are now only 100 Switches in circulation (Keith's friends). So you have a situation where Melvin owes 150 Switches to high schoolers and there are only 100 available (150% short position of float). Melvin is overconfident and thinks he will get 150 Switches same day or at the very worse case, the day after, and maybe have to pay 150 Switches x $5 penalty = $450. He'll still have made $3,000-$450 = $2,550. The $5 penalty due to the high schoolers is interest or Melvin's carrying costs, so the longer Melvin cannot get the Switches, the more expensive it's going to be for him. After 4 days, he's at break even and will lose $450 for each day he cannot get a Switch. It gets very expensive for Melvin and his parents very quickly. This is what's happening for the past week or so for GME. The hedge funds are bleeding money every day they cannot fulfill the IOU.

For those who are asking why Melvin doesn't just pay off the high schoolers with money, let's say that the new Zelda game is coming out and they all want to play. They also know that the price of Switches is rising. Even if Melvin offered $800 or $1,000 to cancel the IOU, they know that they can no longer get a Switch on the open market. In addition, the high schoolers are probably aware of the rising trend in Switch prices. They may think that it's better to wait for a Switch that will be worth $15,000 in a few days than to get paid off by Steve now for $1,000.

Below is a time capsule of what you missed out on in 2020! Ah, feels like it was yesterday...

Well, with the economy currently collapsing, it's only going to get more interesting going forward!

Hop into the daily discussion thread (at the top of r/wallstreetbets/hot), have some fun and stick around!

Over the past few days, this subreddit has seen an absolutely insane amount of growth. In the past week, subscribers have quadrupled, pageviews have surpassed 1 BILLION, and the potential financial gains are unlimited!

We wanted to take a moment and teach all the newcomers what wallstreetbets is all about.

Wallstreetbets is a place of high risk, high reward, trades. Some are well thought out... but not usually.

#**We've got [losses](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

There was the guy who [bought gourd futures and lost everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/), the guy who [turned a $5,000 investment into a $58,000 loss](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/aeqcvt/i_dont_know_when_to_stop/), the guy who [put everything on the Argentinian peso, hours before it collapsed](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/cpcao5/the_guy_that_called_argentina_to_tank_was_right/eworkdq/), the guy who [had to take physical delivery of oil](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/g5e3e5/i_bought_oil_at_32_yesterday_and_made_26000_sort/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamjdk) and [""GUH"" which is a video you just need to watch](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/dpnzup/i_recorded_todays_marketopen_and_the_instant/). You can check out some more of [those losses here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3ALoss&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got [gains](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all)!**

Like resident GameStop multimillionaires u/deepfuckingvalue, we had the guy [who accidentally made $110K](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/7w6cq0/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=usertext&utm_name=wallstreetbets&utm_content=t1_glamo3x), there's the guy who [shorted the powerball lottery](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/3zvxp5/shorting_powerball_update/) You can check out some more of [those gains here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/search?q=flair%3AGain&restrict_sr=on&include_over_18=on&sort=top&t=all).

#**We've got general craziness!**

Like when [we found the ""infinite money cheat code"" on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/drt5tr/guh_of_fame_2019/), forcing [Robinhood to post to WSB](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/e4r0sy/robinhood_statement_on_options_collateral_and/) and push an update disabling options, we had [the CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, Martin Shkreli](https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/3q38qg/iama_martin_shkreli_ceo_of_turing_pharmaceuticals/), regularly posting, livestreaming, and even becoming a moderator. We've got [Mr. Beast investing $100,000 in whatever the top comment said to invest in](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/hrorfa/i_will_invest_100000_into_whatever_is_the_top/). We've got [Pokimane, asking what to invest in and becoming a moderator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/f75eod/thank_you_for_giving_me_moderator/) and subsequently crashing the market in March. We have people who lost bets and had to [drink their pee](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/gak2gf/i_said_if_spy_closed_green_today_i_would_drink_my/) and [tattoo our logo on their butt](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/io8i5z/im_back_bitches/) (NSFW).

So if you have an insane trade idea, **post it here**! We look forward to roasting you like we did u/deepfuckingvalue when he posted about GameStop in 2019. He's worth 8 (9?) figures now, so who knows, maybe you'll be next?

What you won't find here are political discussions, self-promotion, and other nastiness is not related to our single and most important goal: making money. 

For those new to the subreddit, you'll notice that we use [some ""colorful"" language](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7fr21/basic_guide_to_wallstreetbets_culture_for). Rest assured, we mean you no harm. It might take a while to get used to how we talk, but you'll quickly find that this subreddit is surprisingly kind.

#**And we've got you!**

The community here is incredible. Each and every one of you make this place great and better than it was the day before. 

For those who have been around for a while, please reach out and help the newcomers. For those who are new, please don't hesitate to ask questions and get involved. 

From the bottom of my heart, thank you for being here.

481,I made a spreadsheet for people who don't know how to budget!,50774,boza0g,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/boza0g/i_made_a_spreadsheet_for_people_who_dont_know_how/,1609,"Hey guys! last year I made a spreadsheet to help myself budget- I'm terrible at sticking to a budget so I made a sheet that breaks it down so that I just have the ability to break it down to a daily manageable amount.

[Heres what it looks like](https://imgur.com/a/ojaju7a)

I grew up very poor and had NO sense of what or even HOW to start budgeting. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. Another problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number.

&#x200B;

The sheet was set up with three goals in mind:

&#x200B;

1. that it be easy to use
2. that it focuses on a daily budget that supports long term goals- instead of a long term budget that doesn't have daily support
3. that it be a good starting place for people who have never saved before

&#x200B;

So how does it work?

The main budget is divided into three core areas:

&#x200B;

* Income: You use this to fill in your income and choose to have a monthly, weekly, or bi-weekly pay cycle. If you are a worker who is tipped it includes an area where you can add tips, my suggestion is put in your minimum average income from tips- So for example, if you usually make 100 from tips a week, even if you get extra, try to program your budget around the 100 minimum average.
* Expenses:  There you can add your expenses. Utilities are bills that are for electricity, heat, phone, internet, or water. Bills are important expenses that you can't miss and are integral to living. Finally, expenses are other things you need to allocate money for- whether it be gas, lunch expenses, transportation- ect. Within your expenses there are TWO areas to which you need to pay attention:-Credit Card Payments: this is new to this year's sheet, use the tab below to fill out your information for up to three credit cards. Decide whether to pay the minimum payment OR choose an amount to pay. The tab will allow you to see how much you're paying and how much interest you're accruing.  Once you have filled it out, your budget will adjust accordingly.-Big Purchase: Use this tab to create a budget for a large purchase, and adjust your budget easily and automatically to finance this purchase!
* Budget summary:  Finally the most important part of this sheet is the budget summary- Here you will see just how much you can spend. This money is shown in three ways, the lump monthly sum, a weekly amount, or a daily amount. As long as you don't go over that number, you will have enough money for the rest of your budget. It will also feature a breakdown of what your budget it, where your money is going, and what your income VS spending is!

&#x200B;

[~~Here is a link to the sheet~~](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YCjtrGVKUM7siXilSaqnlHXwemH-QGBEULZBm5bEDMg/copy)

&#x200B;

ou use it like this

* Go in
* Make a copy
* Change the numbers
* Decide what percentage of your income you want to be saved
* Budget.

The sheet includes three charts:

* A bar graph as a simple visual tool to see if you are spending more than you are saving
* A pie chart to see where your money is distributed
* A daily Pie chart to see realistically where your money is going compared to your target savings

I don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

The companies that leveraged themselves to the moon, did stock buybacks to hyper-inflate their stock price, live on constant debt instead of good balance sheets are now being bailed out by unlimited QE. Free money to cover your mistakes. Why would anyone run a good business ever again? Just cheat and scheme and get bailed out later.

Edit: I am truly honored to be the number 1 post on WSB. To get validation from you autists and retards, the greatest American generation, is the peak moment of my life. Thank you all.

Edit 2: Many of you are saying this post is socialist. It is anti-capitalist. It is anti-wall street. It is none of that. My post is in fact about fixing capitalism so it is done the right way. Don't reward companies that are managed poorly and don't invest their profits wisely. Capitalism is about survival of the fittest and rewarding the winners not the schemers and cheaters. I'd rather have a profitable company that pays its workers livable wages, doesn't use sweat shop labor, doesn't pollute our environment, gives good quality healthcare, paid family leave, sick leave, maternity/paternity leave, reinvests in improving infrastructure, keeps low debt to equity, and has a 12 month emergency fund for a black swan event. Not companies that give all the money to the CEO and Board and nothing to the workers, do stock buy-backs with profits instead of improving infrastructure or saving for emergency funds. Let the greedy poorly run companies fail so we can invest only in good quality companies that treat their workers well. We will all make tons of profits in the market with well run companies and main street America will also be able to live a decent quality life. 

Edit 3: I am not a salty bear. In fact I want the market to do well. But this is not the way. Bailing out weak companies that didn't save for a black swan event because of CEO greed is just making this bubble bigger and bigger and it will only pop worse later on. JPow will ruin our market and the economy with this fake bubble with his printer. Let the market be free so we can shed weak companies and true capitalism can see a rise of the strong companies and the market can moon again.

JPow and his printer are really helping the Wall street elite. Jpow doesn't care about you. Now the tax payers are bailing out shadow banking. Junk bonds are risky loans that private equity, hedge funds, and other shadow banking institutions give out to desperate companies that can't get loans from regular banks anymore. That's why junk bonds are shadow banking instead of traditional banking. JPow is using his unlimited printer to BAILOUT and give free money to the shadiest and greediest characters of wall street and society in general - private equity, hedge fund managers, shady billionaires.

PE, hedgies, shady billionaires were screwed because the economy just halted and companies were going to default on these risky loans since they had no revenue coming in. This is who JPow is helping. He just bailed them all out by buying these risky junk bonds on the back of the American tax payer. You may become homeless and starve, but private equity, hedge fund managers, and shady billionaires will be made whole by the fed.",1586451659.0

The  New Failure to deliver data is JUST OUT from the SEC.  Here is a simple pivot table.   It's still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  I'm sure people will analyze this better than me.   But I wanted to get this out to everyone ASAP.

Edit: Failure to deliver is how many shares were not accounted for at the end of the day.  GME has been failing to deliver in some capacity for weeks now.  This data is posted by the SEC Freedom of  Information Act (FOIA).  It is only posted every two weeks, for the previous two weeks.  But this is the most recent data that everyone has been waiting on.

From the SEC regarding this data

>""The   figure is not a daily amount of fails, but a combined figure that  includes both new fails on the reporting day as well as existing fails.    In other words, these numbers reflect aggregate fails as of a specific    point in time, and may have little or no relationship to yesterday's    aggregate fails.""

&#x200B;

SEC FOIA Site: [https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm](https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm)

Data File: [https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip](https://www.sec.gov/files/data/fails-deliver-data/cnsfails202101b.zip)

&#x200B;

GME had 2 million shares failed to deliver one day totaling 300 million $

EDIT: Because so many people are bringing up XRT.  Which contains a lot of GME. Here is XRT.  Hmmm.  Notice anything interesting about Jan29th between these two??

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

There is also AMC... AMC is still failing to deliver EVERY DAY.  This continues the trend for both of these stocks not being delivered every day.  AMC had 27 million... yes million shares failed to deliver.

&#x200B;

I'd like to ask everyone to do what they can.  I am not recommending buying any of these stocks.  But there is for sure, something still going on.  We need to try and get this data daily.  Contact your reps, etc.

There are links to information about Failed to deliver.[https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm)

Is GME considered a Threshold Security? ‚úÖ

>In   order to be deemed a  threshold security, and thus subject to the   restrictions of Rule  203(b)(3), a security must exceed the specified   fail level for a period  of five consecutive settlement days.    Similarly, in order to be removed  from the list of threshold   securities, a security must not exceed the  specified level of fails for   a period of five consecutive settlement  days.

Does the Firm have to close out the positions? ‚úÖ

>As adopted, Rule 203(b)(3) requires any participant of a registered clearing agency (""participant"")[80](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P210_72014) to take action on all failures to deliver that exist in such securities ten days after the normal settlement date, *i.e.*, 13 consecutive settlement days.[81](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P211_72496)Specifically,  the participant is required to close out the fail to   deliver position  by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity.Rule 203(b)(3) is intended to address potential abuses that may occur with large, extended fails to deliver.[89](https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/34-50103.htm#P221_79239)  We believe that the five-day requirement will facilitate the identification of securities with extended fails.

&#x200B;

Edit:  I wrote a quick post about this last report.  I'll copy some stuff here.  AS requested, here are some data snippets for ""normal"" stocks.  note the number of failed to deliver is way lower.

WSB before this crazy week that has changed the sub forever was all about taking on risk to try and make money fast.

**BOOM!**  $39 investment.  We're going to make that back in.... *three days*.  Are you ready?  We're going to make enough food for dinner *AND* left overs for lunch.

I'm going to give you some of my super-secret-I-eat-this-every-week-crockpot-meals that are delicious, cheap, filling and easy.  Yes.  The crockpot makes *all* of those possible.

**MEAL 1: Thick Cut Porkchop with Potatoes and Carrots**

>Servings: 4

>Ingredients:

>1 Can Beef Broth (50 cents)

>1 Packet Brown Gravy Mix (50 cents)

>1 Packet Onion Soup Mix (50 cents)

>1 Package of 4 Thick Cut Porkchops ($7)

>6 Carrots (50 cents)

>4 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)

>Sack o' Salad ($2)

>Total cost for lunch and dinner: $13/4 about $3 each.

>Spray or wipe crockpot with cooking oil.  Add beef broth, gravy mix and onion soup mix and stir.  Place porkchops in broth.  Chop carrots and potatoes and add to top of porkchops.  That's it.

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home make your salad and dig in.  Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**MEAL 2: Sausage, Potato and Kale Soup**
>Servings: 4

>1 Pound Italian Sausage ($4)

>1 White Onion ($1)

>1 32 Oz Box of Chicken Stock ($1.50)

>1 Bag of Prewashed Kale ($3)

>3/4 Cup Heavy Cream ($1)

>5 Large Gold Yukon Potatoes ($2)

>1 Head of Garlic ($1)

>Total cost: About $14/4 = 3.50 a serving

>Brown italian sausage with chopped garlic and chopped onion.  While meat is browning add to crockpot the 3/4 cup of heavy cream, chicken stock, and chopped yukon potatoes.  Add browned sausage and top with half the bag of kale.  (I get two recipes per bag of kale).

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.

**MEAL 3: Super Awesome Easy Chili**
>Servings: A Lot (6-8?) -- I eat this *all* the time and it's delicious.  Stores really well in the refrigerator (and chili gets better over time!)

>3 Cans of Black Beans ($2)

>2 Cans of Hot Chili Beans ($1)

>2 Cans of Red Kidney Beans ($1)

>8 Cans of Diced Tomatoes ($6)

>1 Pound of Ground Beef ($4)

>1/2 Cup of Chili Powder ($1)

>1/4 Cup of Garlic Powder ($1)

>1/4 Cup of Onion Powder ($1)

>3 Tablespoons of Cumin ($1)

>3 Tablespoons Black Pepper ($1)

>Edit: The spice proportions are correct!  This makes nearly two gallons of good (about 7L).

>Edit: Salt to Taste($1)

>Total cost = $20/8 = About $2.50 per serving

>Drain the tomatoes and kidney beans but don't drain the black or chili beans.  Brown the ground beef.  Add everything to the crockpot and stir like crazy.... and that's it!

>PREPARE THIS BEFORE YOU GO TO BED FOR THE NEXT DAY!  Put it in the refrigerator and pull it out in the morning.  Cook on low for 8 hours.  When you get home dig in! Use the left overs for lunches and/or dinner for during the week.


It's easy guys.  It's really easy.  You spend 15 minutes a night and you make *tons* of food for lunch and dinner and you save a LOT of money!  AND ITS GOOD FOR YOU! (better than Wendy's--that's for sure!)  AND ITS EASY!

**Stop spending your money on eating out and go full crockpot!  I am much happier and much wealthier!**

EDIT: For our vegetarian friends.  You can't get any more simple than this!

**MEAL 4: Baked Potato**
>Servings: As many potatoes as you bake

>1 Potato

>Cover in tin foil and place directly in crockpot.  Cook on low 4-6 hours or keep on warm all day.


**MEAL 5: Vegetable Soup**
>Servings: However much you want to make

>Tomatoes, Potatoes, Green Beans, Zucchini, Carrots, Peas, or Onions

>Vegetable Stock

>Onion Powder, Garlic Powder, Salt and Black Pepper

>Add vegetables in any proportion you desire to crockpot and add vegetable stock until covered.  Season to taste.  Cook on low until vegetables are tender.

EDIT 2: I live in Georgia and shop at Kroger--prices may vary.  If you live in Canadia or buy organic free range vegetables harvested by hipsters with a minimum of a master's degree you will obviously pay more.

EDIT 3: ""Just learn to cook!""--Yeah, okay guys.  I agree.  I cook more than just in a crockpot.  This post was inspired after I read a /r/personalfinance about a single guy who spends $1300 a month on food because ""he didn't have enough time to cook with work"".  I wrote a very long comment and just made it into a post.  The point was you can eat decent food in a short amount of time and save money by planning one day ahead.  

EDIT 4: I agree fresh vegetables are better and these aren't the *healthiest* recipes.  This post was just to encourage those that eat all the time to transition to something healthier... and then they can transition to something even healthier... and on and on until they've become a raw vegan, growing their own vegetables, saving the whales and composting regularly.

EDIT 5: Electricity costs: Crockpots seem to consume between 200W and 700W per hour.  That's between 2 and 6 kWhs for 8 hours of cooking.  That's about 15 to 60 cents.  It seems insignificant relative to the overall cost of food.

EDIT 6: I'm not a shill or marketing person for crockpot.  I'm a mechanical engineer.  Don't believe me?  My first post on reddit ever was about bolt failures:  https://www.reddit.com/r/spacex/comments/3e20vs/bolt_failure_modes/ctatj1y/

We could make the rules, profit from the advertising, and finally get paid for the memes we make.

I've even come up with a list of things we could do as new owners:

1. Reddit mods can apply for paid-internships at Reddit. This is much closer to having a real job than what they currently do and would benefit the organization.
2. Your flair is your official title at the company. IE: instead of ""CFO"" you'll be ""PotatoFart""
3. NSFW posts will receive special protections--and if you happen to work in our new skyscraper then NSFW posts are automatically considered SFW.
4. Everyone gets a turn in the corporate jet.
5. Elon becomes a mod. He can also apply to become a paid intern.
6. We have a monthly party on our company yacht: *The S.S. VisualMod*.
7. Our corporate cafeteria is a dining hall with fast food restaurants along the side--but they're all Wendy's.

I think this is a great idea.

He is now in more danger than any of us. I doubt that anything will acruallly come of this, but now real heat is coming out, as tends to when traditional power dynamics are upset. 

Not to mention; despite the fact that he was acting as a private individual and not actually acting in an official or financial position, the optics are being set up against him. 

Do not attack him if he decides to withdraw all today. He has his own life and family to protect. He‚Äôs also much more vulnerable than anyone here, and he doesn‚Äôt have the polemical connections like citadel does. Not to mention he just screams boomer bait. 

I suspect he‚Äôs feeling pressured into not selling because of the cult status he has here. But his own personal life comes first. Chances are, he may never be able to work in an official financial position again. 

I‚Äôm not crying for his financial future or anything, he‚Äôs worth 8 figures. But again, he needs that money given his position. For the rest of his life he will be a political prop. Please respect his decisions and most importantly realize he‚Äôs a fucking human being with his own life

Belfort is the epitome of what we‚Äôre up against as retail. He‚Äôs a convicted con artist who actually did so much fucked up shit he didn‚Äôt just get a slap on wrist from the SEC, he actually went to prison. 

He was just anti-GME a few days ago, and now he‚Äôs meme-ing in its favor? A meme repeating the sentiments being echoed in this sub? 

It‚Äôs pretty clear to me. Belfort came to the realization that this is the next generation of decentralized hedge fund. There‚Äôs power when a bunch of apes all like the same stonk.

He wants to sell you his shitty motivational book and the idea that he can teach you how you can be rich and famous with his ‚ÄúmiNdSeT‚Äù when really he got rich by scamming people, and famous for being caught.

Hedge funds get paid more by fraudulently creating more shares when the stock goes under. They cannot cover anywhere near this price level because the shares don't exist.

Because by all accounts South Africa is screwed. My planned position is bottom paragraph.

Under the current ANC government there has been a general degeneration of all aspects of South Africa. Due to systemic nepotism, there are math teachers that don't know what square roots are, army officers that can't read, and cops that have never fired a gun. The practice of fictitious employees that take checks but don't work there is widespread enough that the government has drove itself into insolvency already. Estimates are that some 80% of government funds are misused in some way, ranging from government subsidies given to businesses owned by government officials to simply going missing from accounts. The ANC solved this, against advise of wiser people, with quantitative easing. Which is a fancy term for printing money, and since they could never possibly reverse that printer they're inflating the South African Rand which is why they've had two bouts of inflation near 9% twice in the past 20 years.

That is all besides how the largely defunct government doesn't prevent anything on the ground. Roaming bands of pirates (many affiliates of the Marxist Economic Freedom Fighter party) will poison guard dogs and torture and murder residents often for as little as car keys and groceries. Many communities are functionally independent and take the law in their own hands, and in many areas utilities are defunct (untreated sewage goes in the river, untreated tap water comes out and it smells as disgusting as it sounds). South Africans are more likely to have their asylum applications accepted than any other nation as there are so many tales of rape and murder and threats of ethnic cleansing. This equates to the most educated citizens leaving SA and most SA based businesses diversifying out of the country as literacy rates have been falling. These disillusioned departures are not new, as they include the most famous Afrikaner in history Elon Musk who is now a naturalized American.

Edit: The Economic Freedom Fighter's usual acronym isn't used because it's also the ticker for a penny stock.

I first thought about shorting South Africa over a year ago when I was researching the country (I'm a historian, I read much on the country for fun). I found the only index tracking SA ([EZA](https://www.bing.com/search?q=eza+stock&cvid=0d411debffed4d50b06fa54733b0bb0a&FORM=ANAB01&PC=DCTS)) wasn't an accurate representation of SA economy and buying puts on it was useless. It tracked only the largest cap firms, which are the aforementioned companies diversifying out of SA (mostly to other parts of Africa). Which is why it's a volatile ETF that overall trades sideways. Buying puts on it wouldn't really capitalize on SA going full Rhodesia/Zimbabwe. Zimbabwe having experienced the general breakup of modern institutions and hyperinflation due to similar problems.

My new broker, IBKR, allows negative currency positions as long you post 10% as collateral. Now my native currency are US dollars, where inflation in 2020 was 1.4% while the [South African Rand's inflation](https://www.inflationtool.com/south-african-rand) was 4.12% in 2020. That equals a 26.8% return on investment per year from that simple short position. But I'm expecting US Dollar inflation to stay between 1-2% a year while the Rand (ticker ZAR) stays north of 4% with inflation spikes inevitable over the next decade. This position also reduces my market beta, much needed for me as I've got hugely leveraged positions on American ETFs. This isn't a short term swing trade, I'm waiting for SA to implode.",1613465649.0

My father was 57 years old, and had a lot of issues. Nobody really thinks about all the good things until someone is gone. My father wasn't a man of means, but during the early stages of my childhood fought hard to provide us an amazing life. And did so without ever really letting us know. 

After a divorce from my cheating bitch of a mother, after multiple back issues, multiple surgeries, and multiple risks to his day to day life, I think he just went downhill. 

I haven't gotten an official answer from the coroner since he's over 3 states away and it's all being communicated mostly through texts with his girlfriend right now, but honestly I'm not sure I want to. 

I came here to say, my father believed in me with all of his being. When I told him I owned 4 shares of  GameStop and that it was way over priced when I bought it, he just told me how proud he was. Pretty convinced he didn't even know what I was saying. But in that same way he believed in me, he believed in every single one of you too.

To anyone who has not gone through this process before I would advise you to have the hard conversation with your parents and ask them what their final wishes are.

I know you guys can't read, but I highly recommend learning how to read and reading this.üöÄüöÄüöÄ

**Part 1: What Happened on the 28th?**

As we all know, last Thursday on the 28th RH and other brokerages disabled the purchase of GME shares at a critical moment that very well may have been the beginning of the squeeze. This is a significant day because it broke momentum, and many users seem to believe that the hedge funds planned this moment to strategically cover their short positions.

[Here is a graph of the 28th with some of my analysis](https://imgur.com/a/XyG9sfV)

[Here is a tweet from Ihor (S3) stating the short interest data as of the 28th](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355194252674953219?s=20)

Per S3, Short Interest was 62.9M as of the 27th and 57.8M as of the 28th. The net SI is (57.8M)-(62.9M)= -5.08M. This means the net short position reduced by 5.08M shares, however, many users claim that hedge funds may have used this opportunity to shift their short position higher so that they could minimize losses by covering on the way back down.

Well lets say that's what happened, and lets assume it was carried out flawlessly. We will also assume this happened in a vacuum, i.e. retail did not contribute to any volume, so that we can get a liberal estimate.

To establish a short position at a higher price, hedge funds would be borrowing to short sell shares for the first 30 minutes as the price quickly rose to $482.85. If the entire volume during this period of time was hedge fund short selling, than they would have opened 15.8M more short positions. ~10M in volume happened in the first 10 minutes, so at best they would have 10M more shares sold short between $275 and $350, and the remaining 5.8M positions would be opened between $350 and $480.

This means that if shorts added to their position at this time, the best they could have done is add ~15.8M short positions at an average ~$300. This is assuming **no covering** was done during this period of time, which is highly unlikely considering the price **went up.**

Now, during the freefall following RH trade restrictions, there was only 10.4M in volume. If hedge funds used this moment to cover old positions at a reduced price, they would have only been able to cover 10.4M positions, and 5.7M of those positions would have been covered at a cost greater than $300, only 4.7M could have been between $300 and $112. This is a minuscule amount of covering despite the ideal period of time, and it doesn't even account for that fact that **covering would drive the price up, not down.**

Lastly, after the nosedive there was a bounce of ~9.2M in volume. If we were to assume hedge funds were again able to add more short positions here to transition into a better average, they would only be able to add 9.2M at an average of ~$250. Once again, however, adding positions would have drove the price down, not up.

So even in the most ideal situation using RH's restrictions and ignoring market mechanics, shorts would have only been able to add 25M ideal short positions at an average of ~$280, while covering only 10.4M at exorbitant costs.

This likely didn't happen, for several reasons. 

First, S3 reports that short interest decreased by 5M on the 28th. Now of course there is plenty of volume to cover after the first half of trading, however, they would be at non-ideal prices.

Second, this theory is impossible because when shorts cover en mass, the price would increase not decrease, and when shorts sell en mass, the price would decrease not increase. 

Third, this is assuming that 0 volume was from retail investors trading between eachother, also highly unlikely given the hype at the time. 

Fourth, in order to sell something short you need to borrow a share, and we know that, at that time, GME was **hard to borrow.** 

What is more likely is the **inverse** of the above, which would mean shorts covered 15.8M shares at an average cost of $300, then short sold 10.4M shares at an average of $250, before further covering 9.2M at an average of $250. **Despite ideal circumstances, that is not an ideal result for hedge funds.**

That means hedge funds **are not** kicking back and counting stacks after swapping their positions to $480 sell points, that would be impossible.

**Part 2: What About Last Friday?**

Now this was an important day, GME fought hard and closed at above $320. What makes this day confusing, however, are the claims that short interest drastically decreased.

[Here is a tweet from S3 claiming short positions decreased by 30M shares by the end of Friday](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1356018482471718916?s=20)

Now I won't get into detail about the other factors that call this claim into question, you can look into those on your own. What I want to go over is **how could it be remotely possible?**

S3 claims 31M shares were covered on the 29th, however the share price had a net decreasing trend. There were only 2 notable upward rallys, and combined they only account for 24M shares. If hedge funds covered the whole 24M in volume it would still be 6M shares off and thats not even accounting for retail investors trading between themselves. Where did the other 6M shares go? I find it hard to believe they could cover 6M shares with no significant upward momentum while retail investors were buying shares in a frenzy on friday.

[Also note that Short Volume was 17.6M on Friday](https://fintel.io/ss/us/gme)

So on Friday there was 50M in volume. 17.6M of that volume was due to shares sold short, so SI would be (57.8 SI as of the 28th)+(17.6M shares sold short) = 75.4M. In order for short interest to have decreased to around 27M as [S3 said](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752?s=20), it would have required the covering of (75.4M)-(27M) = 48.4M shares. **How do you cover 48.4M shares when there is only 50M volume and 17.6M of that volume was used to ADD SHORT POSITIONS?**

**There simply was not enough volume to cover a net 31M shares. At most, 32.4M shares TOTAL could have been covered if EVERY single purchase of GME was by a hedge fund with a short position, which would make SI (75.4M)-(32.4M) = 43M. It is highly unlikely that not a single retail investor, insider or institution purchased GME shares on Friday, so the actual SI is likely much higher.**

Furthermore I want to draw attention to **other times shares were covered** and their effect on the price, and you tell me if hedge funds could cover 31M NET shares last Friday.

[S3 claims](https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1355249817048522755?s=20) that from Jan 12th to Jan 14th, the SI went from ~69M to ~62M, a decrease of 7M shares. On the 12th GME was worth $20 and by the 14th we saw a high of $43, an &gt;100% increase.

They then claim that from the 14th to the 25th, there was a slight steady increase in SI as the share price crawled towards $50. From the 25th to the 27th there was literally **exponential growth** in the share price **despite no change in SI**. But then, all of a sudden, on the 28th there is a net decrease of 5M short positions and a significant reduction in price, and on the 29th there is a net decrease of 31M shares along with a steady decline in price. How could that be remotely accurate?

There was 50M in volume on the 29th, how could the purchase of &gt;31M shares by a single entity, not even accounting for retail, result in a net decrease in share price? 

**Part 3: How Could They Do It?**

[Read this post, and the sources within it, in detail](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ld5rd9/evidence_pointing_to_shorts_did_not_cover/?ref=share&amp;ref_source=link)

Shorts can use deceptive options trades to trick you and other short interest analyzers into believing they have covered **when they have not**

There were $43M worth of mid March 800c purchases, you do the math.

Why was their a silver rush pulled out of thin air on monday? Why is the media still aggressively spreading FUD? Why are there bots everywhere in WSB? Shorts haven't covered, they can't cover and they wont. They also **did not** shift themselves into an advantageous short position last Thursday, there was only 19M in short volume total and minimal volume during ideal circumstances. They want you to think they covered, they also want you to think they have a better short position. 

They want you to think this is over because there may not be enough shares for them to cover even if they wanted to. If there were they would have repositioned on Thursday. Brokerages restricting buying for retail investors was likely due to the fact that shorts couldn't find the shares to cover, nor could they find enough shares to reposition. They really need your shares and want to funnel them away from retail.

TLDR: Seriously, read this whole thing. I know you won't, but do it. Hedge funds did not transition to better short positions during the RH fiasco last Thursday, it would have been impossible to do so in meaningful amounts. They also did not cover 31M shares last Friday, it would have been impossible based on volume alone. They want you to think they did, they need you to, but they did not.

I've been neglecting sleep and insufflating copious amounts of Colombian blow just so I can remain symbiotically attached to every shred of current market data I could find about GME and its current trajectory. 

So, I'm basically an expert at this point (and so is my cousin who used to work for a NASA contractor in Cocoa Beach, Florida). 

This basically puts me on par with that Cramer guy or whatever. 

Anyway, here's a snapshot of where we stand today: 

&#x200B;

[A concerning uppy\/downy thing for some, but a harbinger of extreme, stratospheric ascension for the better-informed among us](https://preview.redd.it/vhlskfppfif61.jpg?width=966&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7426badc70e80e2ef9e342b4a2bcd622b40b704)

&#x200B;

Now, I want to draw your attention to to the dimensions of a three-sided polygon (aka triangle) that I created by referencing a few points that seemed highly sus and therefore worth referencing.   


The result of my wizardry is thus:

&#x200B;

[I used black because it's the color of my soul when I think about how evil the HF guys are in comparison to the paragons of virtue here on WSB](https://preview.redd.it/3rragnyjgif61.jpg?width=966&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da2182d457dbe697f52406c689f7660c9a9a62fd)

Now, this is where shit gets interesting. 

I knew there was something uncanny about the shape of this triangle. I fucking knew that I'd seen this EXACT same triangle before in relation to advanced rocketry, but I wasn't sure where. 

So, I contacted my dealer, boofed another eight ball of the Devil's dandruff, and got to work meticulously pouring through all the available data until BAM. I found it. 

Feast your eyes on this:

See where I'm going with this? 

If not, let me make shit CRYSTAL fucking clear so that you don't have to marshal all six of your brain cells to see what's going on here:

These three-sided polygons are the SAME. I mean, not ^(exactly) but fuck, it's goddamned close enough to call it. And I'm calling it. 

Motherfucker, if you're not 100% convinced that GME is LITERALLY about to go fucking vertical, then you simply aren't paying attention. It's not my fault if you can't understand basic math, geometry, and astrophysics. 

Ok. My work is done here. After we've all made our millions, I wouldn't mind being handsomely compensated for the selfless efforts I've expended just so you mouthbreathers can have some fun money to throw around at your retirement parties.

Now there's a significant chance they won't survive",39440,l93dum,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l93dum/days_ago_robinhood_had_the_potential_to_be_a/,2472,"Bringing **millions** of new agents into the market, disrupting the whole industry with commission-free trading, an intuitive UI that any ape like us can use, becoming the #1 downloaded app across most app stores...

Without Robinhood, this whole thing probably wouldn't have happened and WSB would likely be stuck at 100k subscribers like it was 3-4 years ago. Because lets face it, a hugee percent of WSB use(d) Robintard because we're too low-functioning to use brokerages that use >4 syllable phrases like ""money market fund"" or ""moving average""

Something like this happening right before going public was **GOLDEN** for them. All they had to do was not be a corrupt sellout bitch, keep their huge influx of new users happy, and they would've been set to come out of this a more respectable, even larger brokerage, as well as a high-value public company.

Instead they decided to expose the raw underbelly of their shitty business model and go exactly against their entire mission statement. Even if capital/margin requirements was the reason for the restrictions (it was definitely a factor but protip: it wasn't the full story), it doesn't change anything about the end result. Who the fuck wants to use a BROKErage who can't guarantee functionality during historical black swan events that usually result in the largest transfer of money? And then, **even if** they can't maintain capital requirements to execute trades, they could have handled it better. Just fucking pull the money from somewhere. Take out a huge loan from somebody ASAP. You can always get instant money if you don't give a fuck about interest rates, which they shouldn't because it's short-term and like I said, it would've been **HUGE** for the future of the company. Another one, they could have restricted both buying &amp;amp; selling of the trending tickers, or just go down altogether (RH users are very familiar with the app being down and losing full functionality, why is this time any different?). Yeah it would've sucked but at least it would've fucking stayed consistent with their mission statement of fair, democratic trading for all. I fuckin work at Wendy's and I can still imagine several better alternatives than the BS ""difficult solution"" they did.

And speaking of their mission statement, it's complete BS. It's just a sugarcoated way of saying ""lol we allow poor people to trade and have pretty colors"". They clearly don't give a shit about DeMoCrAtIzInG tRaDiNg FoR aLl. Because if they did, their business model wouldn't have been a Wall Street megacorp keeping the lights on by frontrunning user trade data.

And yeah another reason why ""volatiilty"" and ""trade volume"" excuses are BS is because they **increased** restrictions on Friday when both volume and volatility **decreased** lmfao. Screw this POS jokerage.

Edit: And the lawsuits up the ass. They just finished a $65m SEC settlement **LAST MONTH**, think their rainy day fund is big enough to handle something like this immediately after? Lmao gl


Edit: Tbh this fuckery was such a double win for Citadel because they get to force RH to manipulate the market while also signing their death note, which for Citadel means less retail investors....

How about you gamma squeeze these nuts, shut the fuck up, and read instead of posting more bullshit for the mods to wipe clean like a triple-ply once-over clandestine shit sweep. These mods are heroes for listening to this cringy begging ape shit for months now, so try to make their lives easier and learn something in the process.

TIME is the enemy of Wall Street. They‚Äôre running like a chicken with no head. They have to COVER and pay INTEREST!!

AS LONG AS YOU HOLD AND DONT SELL, those big dips are NOT REALIZED LOSSES! They‚Äôre just psychological losses to make you DOUBT AND SELL!

Brokers restricting PURCHASE of these stocks is creating an UNFAIR ratio of SUPPLY and due to the restriction of stock it creates a LOW DEMAND! Therefore when there‚Äôs a big supply and low demand is when the stock price goes down. However, there is A LOT OF DEMAND and that‚Äôs why they‚Äôre playing DIRTY and restricted purchase to CREATE A FAKE LOW DEMAND! That‚Äôs why there are lawsuits.

2) DONT LET WALL STREET BULLY YOU

3) AS DAY PASSES WALL STREET CONTINUE TO BLEED since they have to cover and pay interest

8) AMC/GME ruled out bankruptcy so your stock won‚Äôt be $0

9) DOUBLE CHECK any news or analyst or posts as they may try to scare you with fake facts. Do your own DD

Since the most recent mod shakeup, the entire team has been petitioning to bring zjz back. We wanted to keep you in the loop, but couldn't, because it might have hurt our chances of getting zjz back. We understand why this might have made you suspicious, but we're excited to put those suspicions to rest today.

Reddit Admins care deeply about the stability and continuity of the community, and so do we. At the end of the day, WSB is not defined by who is at the top of the mod list, it's defined by the conversations we create.

Even in the absence of zjz, we saw awesome discussions happening. Tons of great DDs, insane YOLOs, and beautiful, beautiful, gain and loss porn.

Now, with zjz back, we can take things even further. We can relax posting restrictions on account age and karma, which we use as proxies for post quality, and instead focus on the content of what's being said.

The truth is, I am very, very, optimistic about the future of WSB over the next 3-5 years. We have the absolute best mod team the subreddit has had since inception. Everyone who is part of a team now is someone that has played a big role of either the subreddit, or discord, community for years.

We appreciate your patience with us and the admins. We were all blindsided as we were thrown into this shakeup. No doubt mistakes were made at the beginning, but we're getting better every day to bring you the WSB you probably don't deserve.

Lately, we‚Äôve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn‚Äôt lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn‚Äôt different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn‚Äôt mean that he is on your side. He isn‚Äôt helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you‚Äôre laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn‚Äôt same as you or me, he doesn‚Äôt have to save money for food, he doesn‚Äôt have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn‚Äôt on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn‚Äôt mean that he is your lovely neighbour.

The IRS is setting up a framework for companies to match their employees' student loan repayments in the same way companies match 401k contributions. This will be cost neutral for the employer (edit: as in, it would not be more or less expensive for the company than traditional matching).

Edit: the employer's match would go into the employee's 401k account.

According to the article, employees with student loan debt accumulate 50% less wealth in their retirement plans (by age 30) than their peers without student loan debt. I think most of us with student debt have at one point or another felt ""behind"".

Thoughts? This is definitely a cool idea and would be a great hiring incentive/perk.

Edit 2: due to the popularity of this post, I wanted to remind everyone of some of the rules on our sub.

>We don't allow:
 ‚Ä¢ Moralizing issues
 ‚Ä¢ Petitions
 ‚Ä¢ Political discussions
 ‚Ä¢ Political baiting
 ‚Ä¢ Soapboxing

This is meant to be a discussion of personal finance, debt, and retirement savings, not a meta review of the pros and cons of capitalism. Please keep things on topic.


Edit 3: Since a lot of people are confused, I'll explain how a 401k match works. A 401k is a retirement savings plan that came into popularity as pensions fell out of the mainstream. The 401k is a tax-efficient vehicle to invest your money for retirement. Like the pension, employers can contribite to their employees' 401k plans as a benefit. This is usually done via a matching mechanism: I contribute 4% of my paycheck, and my employer matches that amount. Matches are almost always capped.

With the method laid out in the article, you would be able to make qualified student loan payments and have your company match that amount as a contribution to your 401k, up to a certain amount. So say you make $2000 per month, your employer matches 5% of your 401k contributions, and your monthly minimum loan payment is $1000 (in this example, you have a lot of debt). You aren't contributing to your 401k currently. If your company chose to take advantage of this program, they would put $100 ($2000*0.05 match) in your 401k each month you made a payment on your student loan.

This doesn't ""hurt"" people without loans. This is only subsidized by the government insofaras the 401k is tax-sheltered (you still pay taxes on that money), and this doesn't constitute your company paying your loans. Participation isn't compulsory.",1535464192.0
805,"SEC, DOJ, 60 Minutes ‚Äì Public data suggests massive securities fraud in which hedge funds and institutions have created more Gamestop shares than actually exist for delivery",36836,l9rk78,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l9rk78/sec_doj_60_minutes_public_data_suggests_massive/,2824,"Obligatory emoji üöÄ

**Short Version:**
The short version is that a review of the **'strategic fails‚Äìto‚Äìdeliver'** data indicates that institutional insiders may have counterfeited a massive number of Gamestop shares which is why they tried to stop retail investors from buying more shares on Thursday.

There are are **71 million shares** of GME that have ever been issued by the company. Institutions have reported to the SEC via 13F filings that they own more than **102,000,000** shares (including the 13% of GME stock is owned by Ryan Cohen).  That is already 30,000,000 shares more than even exist.

On top of the shares reportedly owned by institutions, retail investors may currently hold 50+ million shares (counting both  long holdings and call options ‚Äì both ITM and OTM).  

Once you include call options, **retail investors may already hold more than 100% of GME (not just 100% of the float, more than 100% of the actual company)**. This would be definitive proof of illegal activity at the highest levels of the financial system.

813,I mde a spreadsheet for people who dont know how to budget! Ver. 2.0,36714,dp7pww,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/dp7pww/i_mde_a_spreadsheet_for_people_who_dont_know_how/,1231,"Hey guys! I'm back six months later with a new version of the budgeting spreadsheet I made. Earlier this year I posted the spreadsheet I made for myself and it really resonated with people. As I got more and more feedback I found places where I could improve and develop the sheet into something easier to use but still useful. 

You can find pictures of it [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/63LxvUQ)

A bit of background on me and why I made this- and also why it's made the way it is. I grew up poor and was never taught about HOW to handle money. If we had money it was already needed for other things. Food, Bills, all of the money we had already had a place. This made me get a mentality that if I had money I needed to spend it before something came up and the money would go. It's unhealthy, but it was the only thing I knew until I moved out. I was taught that money would disappear if I didn't use it, so I just USED it. Even now I still feel anxiety about money and can spend recklessly if I'm not careful. 

&#x200B;

Another problem I faced is that I have ADHD, so impulse control can be hard, and it can also be hard to keep track of every purchase and focus on a bunch of aspects of a budget. This spreadsheet is made so you only focus on ONE number. 

&#x200B;

I have made this sheet- and previous versions of it- with three goals in mind:

* That it be easy to use
* that I can focus on one daily number while supporting my long term goals
* that it be a good starting place for people who have never had another budget

The sheet is divided into a few different tools.

Budget:

* Select your pay schedule, add any extra income/tips that you get monthly and select the percentage of that income that you want to save.
* the credit card section allows you to input up to five cards and adds your monthly car payments to your expenses
* The expenses area is where you'll add all of your itemized expenses. You can also select when your bill is due during the month- allowing you to see if early on in the month your spendable is different from later on in the month. 

Your budget summary at the top is the breakdown of all the information below. YES I know pie charts aren't useful for everything- but that is useful to visually digest information. Look and see where your money is going, see if you spend more than you earn, and finally- see how much money you can spend.

&#x200B;

This sheet focuses on giving you ONE number to remember. Daily Spendable. If you want to spend money throughout the day you just have to make sure you DONT go over that number and you will always have enough to cover any other expenses. 

 I don't work well with a lot of budgets because I have issues imagining the big picture. By giving myself a daily/weekly/monthly budget I can make sure that on any given day I haven't spent more than I'm allowed to- and if I do i can see where I'm borrowing from or where that money is supposed to come from.

There are a few extra features too- a large purchase calculator that lets you figure how long youd have to save to buy a larger purchase. It includes a monthly tracker that lets you see what youre spending realistically vs what you've budgeted for and finally a daily tracker for further breakdown.

Companies need to get back to rewarding employees for their tenure. Until they do, don't reward companies with your loyalty. When you're worth more on the open market than your company will give you, they are doing you a disservice and you should make the best decision for your own future and go make what you're worth. The more people who do this, the more likely companies will be to change and allow us to stick around and be compensated for it.

848,A Small Reminder of Some of the Risks Involved,35604,l7xj5z,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l7xj5z/a_small_reminder_of_some_of_the_risks_involved/,1433,"There is a prevailing mis-understanding among people fresh to the market that you can buy and sell as much as you want at the ""market price."" This is false. You are buying and selling from real people or algorithms that believe they can scalp your order. The idealized scenario is that GME rallies, Melvin covers, and everyone at reddit gets out at the top. This represents a misunderstanding of market mechanics. Melvin will cover before we truly know it, and the crash will happen as quick as the rally.

So with recent events, you must ask yourself:

# Who is Your Counterparty?

Nothing is a sure bet. How confident are you that your counterparty is who you think it is? Thousands of redditors & new traders beyond have been buying stocks fully confident that Melvin Capital hasn't  exited their trade. This is also supported by some analysis provided by two different firms, although their estimates differ some amount. Confounded in this is the interpretation of the data: Does this include market makers and dealers that are short stock but covered with calls or options deltas? Is their information fully accurate in an event the likes of which has never happened? It's tough to know for sure. 

# Know Everyone's Hand

Your guess on *how much they've covered* and *when they covered* has a massive effect on how you perceive the value of this trade. Buying if you think Melvin has $10b notional to cover is a much better bet than if they only have $2b to cover. You also have to consider how much notional the rest of the market has bought in anticipation of a squeeze. The difference between the two represents your effective edge.

Remember, we don't *actually* know Melvin's current position. We don't know what's going on behind closed doors. We only know the hand they're showing us via media. Has their clearing firm taken over? Has a much bigger collection of firms absorbed the position? Have they been buying since Monday? Have they covered and have new funds entered the space at a much better level? 

You are fighting Goliath at a poker table in the city of Gath. The pot is worth $25 billion dollars. Ken Griffin has *never* lost. Melvin's prime brokers Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche are not used to losing (well, Deutsche is). They will do whatever it takes to take the pot *from you* and leave you holding the bag. They will not blink twice because there is a *lot* of *fucking money* on the line.

# Know What Can Go Wrong

Nobody could have guessed everything that happened this week. Prepare yourself for the unexpected. Your brokerage will undoubtedly close out your position at the worst possible time. The stock could be halted for days. You could be assigned on ITM options. Your stock could get delisted. Your stock may get diluted.

# Only Spend What You're Willing to Lose

This one is self explanatory. Your investment could go to zero. Even if you think you make money on every trade, if your bet size is 100%, the long term value of your portfolio is **zero*****.***

# Don't Take Out Loans on Emotional Capital

If you are new, you really don't know the gut-wrenching, stomach-turning feeling of seeing the possibility of your net liquidity hitting zero or negative. It fucking sucks. You just know the highs. You're buying along the speculative frenzy and frantic rallies, wrapped in anti-billionaire & pro-underdog themes. It may even feel good to think that a guy who cut his teeth at a firm notorious for an insider trading scandal is getting his comeuppance. We love the feeling. **If you are fully invested financially & emotionally, you are completely overleveraged and will pay the price.** Make feeling good your goal, and set limits that you can stomach. 

There are several feel-good stories of people making life-changing money to pay off their student loans or their family members' surgeries. Please think twice about this, and only spend what you can afford to lose. If placing a bet makes the difference between your pet living or dying, you may have a gambling problem. These were success stories because they got in at a much better level and could have had a much sadder ending.

Secondly, don't take it personal. There are people on the other side of your trades, your brokerage support line, the subreddit, the media. They are all playing their own hand to the best of their knowledge. It's easy to blame a broker, yell at their support desk, hate-tweet at a company, or even rage-text that guy you know who develops APIs at ETrade. A lot of people across the industry are *rooting* for you. Fuck, even Ted Cruz and AOC are *rooting* for you, because this transcends politics. If you're mad at Melvin Capital or Ken Griffin or the guys who crashed the economy in 2008, keep it that way. They will try and misdirect your anger in every single direction: brokerages, the media, and reddit. If your enemies are a few guys at the top holding a $25b short position and moving levers, keep it that way. 

Thirdly, if you don't want to be a human being for the sake of the person on the other side, be a human being for your wallet's sake. You make better financial decisions in the absence of emotions.",1611939261.0

First off, my position: 1900 shares of GME @ 30, plus 5 calls @ $250. Peak value was nearly 500k.

https://preview.redd.it/96g5d07z45f61.png?width=1007&format=png&auto=webp&s=4e983f8d1a6b56bcf4201d32a56b0c2535886d5b

*This is not financial advice, I'm not an expert, etc*

\*\*WHY SHOULD WE STILL HOLD?\*\* I know there's a lot of sentiment around solidarity, and sticking it to the man, and 'fuck it, I'm down so much anyway'. NONE OF THESE ARE GOOD REASONS TO HOLD. I'm here to talk about the actual reasons to hold.

Here's our biggest problem: **Misinformation**

There is a lot of information being spread around like manure. Mostly unread, mostly un-disseminated, basically just a whole bunch of positive sounding claims meant to serve as confirmation bias.

How do we ensure we're not just buying into bullshit? **By determining exactly what data we have available to make decisions as of right now**. That is what I intend to review (and hopefully gather from you apes) here today.

**A REVIEW OF THE FORCES ACTING ON GME**

1. **Fundamental Value:** This isn't relevant right now. GME is presently a $20/share company, even with Ryan Cohen shooting magic rainbows out of his ass it's not worth more than $60 until they actually start changing their business model. When that happens the value will go up, for now 30% above expected online revenue growth doesn't mean shit in the bigger picture.
2. **Momentum:** This is the biggest reason we hit $500/share, and the biggest reason we're still at $90, way above fundamental value. Here's something to consider: **Momentum, not the squeeze, is why the share price is where it is -** rather, the growing global awareness of the squeeze provided the evidence needed for everyone to rush to get onboard.  But, people are also idiots. Momentum can change directions quickly from an upward to downward pressure, and can be easily manipulated, as we've seen.
3. **THE SHORT SQUEEZE:** What actually causes the high short interest to result in raised share prices? Short sellers who are actually (not theoretically) pressured into closing their positions at an overall loss, and en masse. If most of the shorters can wait out or hedge against their losing positions, then there never has to be a mad rush to buy up shares at whatever price. *Do you actually think Melvin Capital was at any point margin called?*  If/when they exited, they did so in an orderly fashion that best served their interest, to the point that they were straight up given a multi-billion dollar bailout by their competitors! These people don't play by the same rules as you, you fucking braindead monkey.
4. **The Gamma Squeeze:** Last Friday, for the second Friday in a row, a vast majority of calls expired In The Money, and a bunch of call owners were owed shares by today (T+2 rule). The theory behind the gamma squeeze is that call sellers didn't have good risk models and didn't hedge their calls well enough, and so didn't actually  own enough underlying shares to hand over, and now need to rush to buy them at market price. Could that be why there was a massive spike from 80 to 150 this afternoon? Maybe. **But a gamma squeeze can also backfire**. All those people assigned shares may not have the tens of thousands in cash ready to buy, or the margin to borrow. That means all those shares get dumped back on the marketplace.
5. Straight up motherfuckin dirty illegal manipulationOh, best believe it happened, and is still happening. Just to review the hits:
   1. DTCC and/or Retail brokers prevent buying, artificially suppressing demand for Thu price drop and locking up people's money till they could transfer elsewhere.
   2. Sudden increases to margin requirements and severe margin calling
   3. A massive media campaign to announce shorts closed positions and everyone is in Silver
   4. Retail brokers cancelling orders, restricting limit prices, enforcing unwanted stop losses (eToro),
   5. Illegal coordinated short ladder attacks to drive down price and fish for stop losses and paper hands.

&#x200B;

**OK, BUT YOU KNEW ABOUT ALL THIS. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW IS**

***WHAT EVIDENCE DO WE ACTUALLY HAVE ABOUT THE CURRENT STATE OF PLAY?***

&#x200B;

No, really, I'm asking. Our advantage is in our ability to crowdsource information. I will edit and update this list as information is shared. Meanwhile I'll try to flesh out a framework as best I can.

**Argument #1: The Squeeze is not Squoze because Short Interest is still high**

* Claim: As long as the Short Interest exceeds the Float, there is a supply problem for short sellers. This *may* translate into pressure from lenders on short sellers over time, driving the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: What is the current short interest?
   * S3 partners provides estimates using a model, and as of today claim it is only **51% of free float**:Source: [https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752](https://twitter.com/S3Partners/status/1356317744300490752)

* Ortex data provides another estimate using another model, and as of yesterday claims it is only 27 mil shares, only a million shares difference from S3Source: [https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts](https://www.ortex.com/stocks/26195/shorts)

* **REAL DATA:** The SEC releases reported short interest twice a month. The most recent data we have is from Jan 15, and wasn't released to the public until Jan 27.\*\*On Jan 15 the SI was 131%.\*\*The next report for Jan 31 won't be available until Feb 9.Frankly, we can't rely on the REAL data, because it's delayed too long to be relevant.
* Evidence needed: What is the actual free float?
   * I still need help finding this. I know 71 Million shares have been issued overall, but a lot of that is locked up in institutions that would have to report any selloffs within 3 days. If 27 million shorts still need to close, how many shares are readily available?
   * Yahoo Finance puts Float at 46.89 mil shares, FWIWSource: [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

**Argument #2: There hasn't been enough trading volume for shorts to possibly close**

* Claim: assuming \~27 mil shorted, not enough shares exchanged hands since the price blew up to close those positions.
* Evidence: Someone explain to me how this isn't enough volume for shorts to cover. Mark Cuban said pretty much the same thing in his AMA today.

|Date|Trade Volume|
|:-|:-|
|2/2 Tue|77.8m|
|2/1 Mon|37.3m|
|1/29 Fri|50.5m|
|1/28 Thu|58.5m|
|1/27 Wed|93.3m|

**Argument #3: Short Sellers will are under pressure to close, so the squeeze is coming**

* Claim: Short sellers are bleeding money trying to outlast us with their losing positions, and will eventually prefer (or be forced) to close out the loss rather than be caught in the squeeze.
* Evidence needed: Shorts are (on average) in a losing position at current share price ($90), and can't just close right now at profit
* Evidence needed: Any external pressure on shorters to close their position at a loss rather than waiting us out for the price to drop further

&#x200B;

**Argument #4: Market manipulation shenanigans didn't work, and retailers didn't sell off en masse, creating the liquidity shorts need to close cheaply.**

* Claim: Price dips happened during low volume trading (short ladder market manipulation etc), and the longs are holding fast.
* Counterevidence: THE MOTHERFUCKING $300 PRICE DROP YOU DUMB FUCKING NUGGETS
* Evidence: This popular screenshot of Fidelity's order ratio:Source: [https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml](https://eresearch.fidelity.com/eresearch/gotoBL/fidelityTopOrders.jhtml)

https://preview.redd.it/5jnmtl00l5f61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=d9e676fbd3e0811f826463f14d4b9c12971ed6b2

* Counterargument: Order counts don't mean shit. For every share traded there is a buyer and a seller. So 100k buyers buy one share each, and 40k sellers sell 3 shares each. Or 20k buyers place 5 buy orders for one share each, and there are less buyers than sellers overall. WHO KNOWS? This strikes me as very insufficient evidence for bullishness, serving only as confirmation bias for bagholders.
* **Evidence needed:** Something more concrete that better proves that more shareholders held than sold.
* Evidence needed: other brokerages data on buy vs sell orders. Fidelity is just one broker, and a retail broker at that. Hedgies don't trade with Fidelity.

&#x200B;

**Argument #5: The biggest dips were driven by short-ladder attacks during low volume periods**

* Claim: the decrease in price from 500 to 90 is mostly fueled by artificial suppression of demand and fake selling (short ladders), and not so much by change in momentum.
* Evidence: At this point its guesswork based on limited evidence provided by redditors. Essentially, round share numbers sold within microseconds at fractional prices
   * [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual\_representation\_of\_a\_short\_ladder\_attack\_4/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/la682h/visual_representation_of_a_short_ladder_attack_4/)
   * [https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg](https://i.redd.it/qoyvz8grr3f61.jpg)
* Counterargument: short ladder attacks are straight up not real, conspiracy theory confirmation bias invented by WSB itself: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short\_ladders\_are\_not\_real/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/latax6/short_ladders_are_not_real/)
* Evidence needed: I've seen but can't find better video evidence showing the stream of rapid trades at fractional prices and round share counts (100 shares at a time), could use that. \\
* Counterargument: The artificially reduced volume from Robin Hood and other brokers limiting access has now been largely removed, as RH allows 100 shares and by now people had time to transfer funds to another broker. Damage to momentum was done, but if there is still a valid thesis it should just mean people can buy the dip, right?
* Evidence needed: That the price dips over the last 48 hours haven't been accompanied by massive trading volume. I'm seeing a lot, especially compared to Thursday's artificial suppression:

&#x200B;

**Argument #6: 'You are here on the VW short squeeze chart'**

* Claim: See how the famous VW short squeeze also had a massive price drop before it blew up? That's us right now.
* Evidence: A single, solitary chart

https://preview.redd.it/mx6fs2f5r5f61.png?width=1242&format=png&auto=webp&s=60cc9096c46097b7328c59c2572b3466e5241131

* Counterargument: the VW scenario was not the same as the GME play. VW share liquidity plummeted literally overnight when it was revealed that Porsche had bought up 90% of the float (check me on that fact, I'm repeating secondhand info). See the big dip AFTER the squeeze? How do we know we aren't *there*?
* Evidence needed: IDK, some kind of coherent explanation of why VW dipped like that, and why a similar dip would be expected in the GME Play

##If you haven't noticed,  all eyes are on /r/wallstreetbets right now and a certain narrative is being pushed around to make it seem as if this community is disorderly and reckless. What I think is happening is that you guys are making such an impact that these fat cats are worried that they have to get up and put in work to earn a living.    

##Some of these guys traditionally used the media as a tool for them to manipulate the market have failed to further line their pockets and now want to accuse you guys as being manipulators. This is complete nonsense because **ALL** content in /r/wallstreetbets is organic, created only by its users. You guys choose what you like and do what you want to do as individuals.

##There is **NO** organized effort by those us who moderate this community to *promote, advise or recommend any stock*.  It is against our policy to do so and we feel it is crucial to allow members to be able to share their ideas amongst each other with autonomy.  

##The only time we intervene is when we notice any unscrupulous characters appear thinking they can take advantage of our members.  We do our best to identify them quickly and remove them from our community.


##There have been accusations of some inappropriate conduct coming from this community. These are baseless accusations as I have not seen any evidence of this taking place here. You guys know better but I'm going to say it anyway for those who have only recently joined this community that we don't do that stuff here.
  
##People like to talk shit about you when you're a winner, it just comes with the territory.  The way a winner responds is by keeping your head up high and enjoy living rent-free inside the minds of those who doubted you. They'll stare you down as you walk by them with a smile as wide as the sky. You don't even notice them because you're too busy basking in all the glorious tendies you've made.  They hate that you played by the rules and still won.

##That fuzzy sensation you are feeling is called RESPECT and it is well earned.  Wall Street no longer dismisses your presence anymore. The smart ones know that you guys do things differently and will adapt in ways to accommodate you and how you as the next generation want things done.  You should all be proud of yourselves.

I looked at the end of the month and was absolutely dumbfounded at the amount of money I was spending eating out. I thought it might be $300ish dollars! 

Anyway, I paid off the credit card (angrily) and made a vow I would eat at home at every possible meal I could for the foreseeable future. I've spent about $70 a week on groceries, (was about $50/week prior) so plus $42, I went from and $1000/mo food expense (how the ever living hell was I making ends meet with this?) to $322/mo. And the kicker is I still have tons of food leftover at the end of the week.

This means whatever media source is indicating this to be the case is a sellout and their credibility should be in serious question since they either 1) don‚Äôt do their due diligence, or 2) are okay with getting their strings pulled to be used as tools by the wealthy to manipulate masses.

If there was any doubt of these hedge fund‚Äôs influence and manipulate, this whole ‚ÄúWSB going silver‚Äù just put that conspiracy theory to rest and only does more to confirm that the game has always been rigged against the average person.



**Edit:** You know what would be AMAZING?? This was an idea already thrown out there, but if the mods could use twitter (and by pinning a statement on this subreddit) to invalidate the silver BS... That would be SUCH a great fucking move. Maybe a message like **""There is no sentiment among WSB members to buy SLV stock and the little that exists is under scrutiny of WSB members""**. That would just slam the door on any sources propagating that false information and call them out on their BS (because it's just so obviously untrue). It would also make it clear for those checking the credibility of this fake news that the silver hype is a fabrication by variables outside of WSB and inform them of how convenient it is for hedge funds if people pulled from GME, and supported a stock they own massive shares of.

This goes without saying that I'm holding GME till the very end. Given how the media and some brokerages have gotten involved (and in a not so subtle way that benefits the hedge funds), it's not even about the money anymore. And that's coming from someone with student loans who stands to profit by exiting right now.

I have seen this 69 times today.

How stupid are people that they can actually believe this? YEAH when I'm talking over collusion and market manipulation with the fucking white house I make sure all my IT people can hear me. YEAH totally normal for low-level people to know the intimate details of highly-sensitive conversations.

I can literally make a post right now that suggests your mom traded a cut of that ass to robinhood to restrict buying gme and it would be just as credible. Hell it's even more plausible

MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS IS ANOTHER ATTACK. this post is getting spammed to drum up the narrative that this is an alt-right movement, by targeting the white house as the instigator of these holds. If this becomes viral, if we buy into this and start this whole conspiracy based on a single anonymous redditor, we will be forever associated with another qanon conspiracy. we'll be irrelevant in a week.

JUST FUCKING HOLD. NONE OF THIS BULLSHIT MATTERS. HOLD.

Edit: just wanted to be clear - just because something CAN happen does not mean that it DID happen. Sure there is a hypothetical way the US government did this and someone overheard it. Yes, on some level, whether active or systemic, the government is involved.

We don‚Äôt fucking play here. We lose money for fucking breakfast. Every day. And then we come back and lose even more fucking money. We buy out of the money weeklies on fucking THURSDAYS.

That is not entirely true. 

RH is allowing anyone with ZERO shares of GME to buy up to 5.  Anyone with currently less than 5 shares can buy more up to a total portfolio of 5 shares.  Anyone with more than 5 shares can not purchase shares. 

This is important because these fuck clowns know that those of us carrying greater numbers of stock likely have the capacity to buy greater numbers of GME shares and reduce liquidity. 

They are simultaneously:
1)  manipulating the system
2) taking advantage of people with less funds
3) preventing a greater number of shares from being purchased

They did this so they could have a talking point in the media and during their congressional investigations and say ‚ÄúWe reopened stock purchase of GME‚Äù and nobody will dig deeper. 

This is fucking dirty ass pool and fucking outright manipulation. 

Here‚Äôs the video proof:  https://imgur.com/a/AV3IGMa

Edit: and yes.  I do have other brokerage accounts and those are working fine. Shout out to my homies at SoFi, Fidelity, and Vanguard. I have GME stashed in those accounts too.

Edit 2: I‚Äôm not giving a pass to those fucks at other brokers too. Thomas ‚ÄúThe Shit Engine‚Äù Fluffer at IBKR can eat a bag of fucking rotten cocks too.  Saying GME is worth $17 and the stock should be restricted until it drops to $17 because it‚Äôs overvalued.  Fuck you Fluffer. You know what‚Äôs overvalued at $17? Your shitty blowjobs. You give really shitty head you old lemon party fuck. ^no ^homo

Edit 3: RH has now dropped the shares you can buy to 2 shares. If you hold more than 2 shares you can not buy shares.  Go use another broker.  Fuck IBKR, Fuck RH and fuck the hedge funds and brokers.  They are gaming this entire thing.  Go ahead share this post with anyone not on reddit.  Everyone needs to know they are being bent over and violated without lube.  Market got caught doing retarded shit (shorting over 200% of GME) and now we all are suddenly the retards.  GO GET FUCKED Vlad the Cock Impaler and Thomas Fluffer and all of you fuck clowns.

Edit 4: Dear SEC - When GME was trading and trending above $350 is when RH and others dropped the share buy limit to 2 shares.  This is coordinated and planned manipulation.  $350 matters because if GME continues to trade consistently above $350 then gamma squeeze occurs for todays closing options.  This is coordinated and premeditated manipulation.

Here‚Äôs the proof of the new 2 share limit: https://i.imgur.com/RhwgoRu.jpg

#Edit 5: I made a comment that RH was stealing a share from my account.  We all have moments of retardation.  Some of us, like me, dwell in the retard.  I was wrong and I appreciate other redditors pointing out my mistake.  I've delete the comments and posts I made elsewhere.  RH has done enough shit wrong but disinformation, unintentional or not, is not what we are about.  I apologize for the honest mistake.  But fuck RH, IBKR, and the hedge funds anyway.  Nothing changes.

# Gang Life

On your adventure throughout Wallstreetbets you'll notice some retards representing different types of ""gangs"" heres a quick guide to what they stand for.

**Bear Gang / Gay bears / Virgin traders üåàüêª**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go down*

*Note: ""gay bear"" in NOT an alternative to calling someone ""retard"". Being called gay bear is 100x worse, true story.*

**Bull Gang / Big Dongus Crew üêÇ**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go up*

**Kang Gang ü¶ò**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go way up and then way down*

**Theta Gang Œ∏**

\-*These guys get hard when stocks go sideways*

**Cash gang üíµ**

\-*These guys get hard watching other people get hard*

**Late-night gang**

\-*Any retard on wallstreetbets between the hours of 1am pst / 4am est - 4am pst / 7am est*

**West coast gang**

\-*Usually a chad who lives in California or Washington. Heavy presence between 12am pst and 4am pst*

**East coast gang**

\-*Losers that have to wake up at 4 in the morning to look at the pre-market*

**Pajama Traders**

\-*Usually references people who trade futures or those that trade premarket*

**Silver Surfers üèÑ**

\-*People that invest in silver commodity*

**Steel Gang**

\-*People that invest in Vale, X or other stocks that go up when steel is in demand*

**Corn Gang**üåΩ

\-*People that invest in corn*

**Gourd Gang**

\-[*People that invest in Gourd*](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kzoh1c/i_am_financially_ruined_agricultural_futures/)

**Tanker Gang**üõ¢Ô∏è

\-*People that invest in tankers. rip.*

# Surviving as a newcomer

Don't ask retarded questions that are basic such as:

* ""What is an option?""
* ""Should I buy X stock?""
* ""Is it too late?""
* ""What is IV?""
* ""Why can't I trade"" and the market is fucking closed
* ""What are futures?""

All this basic shit will piss off some degenerates because if you don't know any of this there is really no reason for you to be throwing 10k at weeklies you'll lose 99% of the time.

&#x200B;

Not only is it against the rules but nobody gives a fuck about your political thoughts. The only thing we care about on this sub is fucking gay bears and losing money. With this much people in a sub there is bound to be political commentary and I'd advise you to take it to a different sub.

I started off with 32k. I was selling puts on DWAC for a couple weeks and that was gaining me about $500-$1000/wk. i then started selling puts on the SPY and realized I could do an iron condor and sell credit spreads on calls as well. I sold spreads $1 apart in strike and put up $100 in collateral for each iron condor chain. 

On Tuesday I had an iron condor which closed OTM on both sides but robinhood still closed my position for a loss of 9k before expiration (when I was due to collect all premium). I let this go, because I realized it was an oversight on my part to not realize robinhood would close them out. 

Wednesday, I made back 25k

Thursday, the s and p dropped and my spreads became deep ITM. At this point I was only selling put credit spreads, no longer doing iron condors. By end of day Thursday, my account dropped below 25k. I deposited an additional 10k

On Friday, I received a notification that because my account dropped below 25k Thursday, that my instant deposit limit was reduced from 25k to 10k.I started rolling my spreads from 12/16 to 12/23 for either a 0.0 credit or 0.2 debit. Mid way through this, they put a restriction on my account and did not let me trade until I closed out my 12/16 and accepted the loss of collateral, rather than roll the positions. I spent hours on chat support.

I sold my position. And cleared up the call.

Today, after market I received this email stating I need to deposit $4.4MILLION or close all my positions by 12/20 eod. When my deposit from last week, clears on their end 12/21. My app says I only am in a deficit of $776. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôm in a deficit at all. All my positions are covered and nothing has been exercised.

I think the large players are starting to realize they need to take the retards on reddit seriously. I think they're attempting to astroturf the investing subreddits by giving awards to tickers they have a vested interest in. And at this moment, that's anything that isn't GME. They know that once the prevailing enthusiasm subsides they'll have the opportunity to close.

I froze my credit the day after news about the Equifax breach broke, and it looks like TransUnion has since changed their site to push people away from freezing their credit in favor for their own product called TrueIdentity (like what Equifax was doing with their TrustedID Premier.)


The FTC website links to [this page](http://www.transunion.com/freeze) for freezing your credit with TransUnion.


[This is what the website looked before the changes were made on 9/11.](https://web.archive.org/web/20170729070041/https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze) The instructions on placing a credit freeze were clear and there was no mention of their own TrueIdentity product.


If you want to place a credit freeze with TransUnion now:

* You have to get through a page of info about credit and fraud, and then the action it tells you to take is to ""Lock your credit information by enrolling in TrueIdentity.""
* The option to freeze your credit is under ""About credit freeze"", deliberately passive in their use of language
* The description about credit freezing is dissuasive: ""A credit freeze may be available under your state law""
* The link for the credit freeze is also a passive ""click here"" compared with ""by enrolling in TrueIdentity"" language used for the link to their own product.
* Clicking the link to learn more about credit freeze brings you to [yet another page](https://www.transunion.com/credit-freeze/place-credit-freeze2) that tries to convince you to enroll in their product over placing a credit freeze
* After searching through their page of BS, you finally get to the [link to freeze your credit](https://freeze.transunion.com).


This is such a blatant attempt by TransUnion to take advantage of the Equifax breach for their own financial gain. It's a shitty thing for TransUnion to do, and people should be aware that they are being led away from putting an actual credit freeze on their account.

""Over the years, I‚Äôve often been asked for investment advice, and in the process of answering I‚Äôve learned a good deal about human behavior. My regular recommendation has been a low-cost S&P 500 index fund. To their credit, my friends who possess only modest means have usually followed my suggestion.

I believe, however, that none of the mega-rich individuals, institutions or pension funds has followed that same advice when I‚Äôve given it to them. Instead, these investors politely thank me for my thoughts and depart to listen to the siren song of a high-fee manager or, in the case of many institutions, to seek out another breed of hyper-helper called a consultant.""

...

""Over the decade-long bet, the index fund returned 7.1% compounded annually. Prot√©g√© funds returned an average of only 2.2% net of all fees. Buffett had made his point. When looking at returns, fees are often ignored or obscured. And when that money is not re-invested each year with the principal, it can almost never overtake an index fund if you take the long view.""",1519093169.0

My girlfriend applied to a job at a place called HCI group. Within one conversation online they hired her, and said they will send her a check for $4,000 to buy necessary equipment like software. 

This morning, she received an overnight check from Patelco Credit Union for $4,415.

My dad used to tell me ""If it seems too good to be true, it is"". And this seems like one of those things. Does anyone have any info on HCI Group, Patelco Credit Union, company scams where they send you a cashiers and rush you? 

**Edit** Email she just received:

You're to deposit the check to your account and scan and email the atm deposit slip to me on ( redacted ) once done for confirmation, no need to send the slip to any other email address or email any worker that you got the package even if a note came with the check, have already contacted them they just want to make sure you get it, so you email the slip to my email address only, thanks
NOTE: Make sure it's an atm deposit because atm is 24 hours service and funds availability, you need to order the equipment tomorrow once the full funds are available so that you can receive the Equipment by next tomorrow and get started.

you only need to take your atm card with the check to your bank's atm machine then deposit it into your bank account okay ? you will see the option when you get to the atm

**Edit 2** Just talked to Patelco. A check for $4,415 was never issued from their company. Sending Patelco a picture of the check since they said its a fraud, and then shredding that son of a b. I've read all your comments by the way! We're just figuring out how to respond to a very needy spammer.

**Edit 3** Scammers are angry at our non-responsiveness. They threatened us by saying ""you better cash in that check or their agents will find you"". I promptly told them to fuck off and blocked them. Patelco was very happy we called them, since now they know their company is being used for scams.

**Edit 4** Just wanted to do another quick edit. My girlfriend received this job offer from her schools job network. She goes to a small, expensive private college and she got hit with this fraud through a secure network that needs to be approved by the school first. Always be on the lookout for scam. 

**Edit 5** We did NOT shred the check. We decided against it and are going to report it. 

**Edit 6** Blowing up much further than I expected this too. /u/iac74205 said I could report it to the postal inspectors if it came by USPS. It came by FedEx, is there a postal inspector for that?

**Edit 7** We've contacted the school once to report the scam! My girlfriend is taking a shower and right afterwards shes A: Reporting it to the FBI and B: demanding that the school sends out an email blast to all of the students going there. 

**Edit 8** I said it in a comment below, but I just wanted to thank all of you for all of your advice. I've read every comment and we have a ton on our plate to take care of. The users of /r/personalfinance rock!

**Edit 9** Reported it to the school, this was their message: 

Hi Girlfriend,

Thank you for sending over this information.  We have flagged this employer in Handshake as fraudulent and have removed them as an approved employer as well.  I know that REDACTED, our Office Manager, has already created a warning in the system for them, and I will do the same with the information you have sent to me.  I will also discuss with our Directors about any further steps that need to be taken.

Thank you so much for reporting this!  Please let me know if you have any other concerns.

**Edit 10** Using edits to answer FAQ's now. She did not give any information besides what would be on a resume. Work history, name, etc. She did NOT give bank account details or her SS number.

**Edit 11** Just in case someone wanted to see what the fake check and the letter she was send looks like, [here you go](http://imgur.com/a/lfw0M)

**Edit 12** I just wanted to confirm this, both Patelco and HCI are legitimet companies. We called Patelco and they have their fraud working on it. We didn't call HCI but I've had enough messages saying they've worked from HCI I believe its legit. I think this guy was just using the names to sound legit.

Once you turn 18, it's best to establish an account in your name ONLY, so you have sole control of it.  It would even be better if you can establish the account at a different bank/credit union than the one the minor account was in, to avoid any inadvertent connections between the previous and new account.

There are a couple reasons for this.  It doesn't take too long to find stories of people who are still using the accounts they had when they were minors who are shocked when their money is suddenly taken away for reasons beyond their control.  The parents could have financial problems and either use the money to pay off their debts or the money is seized by the institutions that they owe.  There could be disagreements between parents and their kids, so they take the money away as a punishment.  Or, it could just be old fashioned greed and the parents decide to just take the money.  It doesn't matter who earned the money that's in the account.  If two people are on it, the money belongs to both parties and the bank isn't going to stop someone on the account from withdrawing the cash.

Keep in mind also, having your own account does not mean that your parents can't send you money if you need it.  All they need is your account and routing number (the same information that would be on a check) to deposit money into the account.  In addition, there are any number of banking apps today they could use to send money to you if you're still being supported by them.  Other excuses may have good intentions at heart, but from a safety and security standpoint, it's best to establish an independent banking account.",1558365079.0

Last week on Tuesday morning I was sitting at my desk and suddenly started getting emails. Lots, and lots, and lots of them. 30-40 every minute. They were clearly spam. Many of them had russian or chinese words, but random.

I called one of our IT guys and he confirmed it was just me. And the traffic was putting a strain on our mail server so they disabled my account. By that point I have over 700 emails in my inbox. They were bypassing the spam filter (more on that later). After a different situation that happened  a few months ago, I've learned that things like this aren't random.

So I googled ""suddenly getting lots of spam"". Turns out, scammers do this to bury legitimate emails from you, most often to hide purchases. I started going through the 700+ emails one by one until I found an email from [Amazon.com](https://Amazon.com) confirming my purchase of 5 PC graphics cards (over $1000).

I logged into my Amazon account, but didn't see an order. Then I checked - sure enough those cheeky bastards had archived the order too. I immediately changed my password and called Amazon..

I still haven't heard from their security team HOW the breach happened (If they got into my amazon account by password, or did a ""one time login"" through my email.) The spam made it through our spam filter because the way this spam bomb was conducted, they use bots to go out to ""legitimate"" websites and sign your email up for subscription etc. So then I'd get an email from a random russian travel site, and our filters let it through.

Either way - we got the order cancelled before it shipped, and my email is back to normal - albeit different passwords.

And I honestly thought about shipping a box of dog crap to that address (probably a vacant house) but I decided against mailing bio-hazardous waste.

Either way - if you see something suspicious - investigate!

The fact that the market is down right now does not affect your long-term investment outlook, as stocks are a long-term game. If you sell now, you will lose out on the rebound, just as my parents did during the financial crisis of 2008/2009. You do not want to sell now unless you are selling as part of your financial planning objectives that you have identified long before the whole Coronavirus panic hit.

Edit2: to answer some common questions:

1. ‚ÄúIs now a good time to invest?‚Äù - that‚Äôs a weighted question, and not one I can answer directly. There are many factors to determine whether or not it‚Äôs a good time to invest. Please refer to the wiki for investing resources to see if now is a good time for you to invest.

2. ‚ÄúShould I be reallocating from stocks to bonds now?‚Äù - as mentioned above, reallocations should be evaluated as part of your overall retirement strategy. A reallocation is basically selling some investments and buying others in place of those you sold; as such, it is generally unwise to reallocate in response to a single event and should really be done as part of your strategy towards retirement (e.g. reallocating from stocks to bonds as you get older to limit risk exposure).

3. ‚ÄúWill xxxxx affect me?‚Äù - I don‚Äôt know. Although I am a financial professional, if you have any questions relating to your particular circumstances, you should seek out a financial professional outside of Reddit or refer to the wiki in this sub for specific information.

4. ‚ÄúWhat if you‚Äôre close to retirement? Should I sell?‚Äù - if you‚Äôre close to retirement, the general financial planning consensus is that you should not have a significant percentage of your wealth in equities. Example allocations would be anywhere from 80/20 or 90/10 bonds to equities. If you have any more than 20% equities and are close to retirement, yes you should probably think about reallocating to bonds, but not because of this recent stock market panic. Again, please consider speaking to a financial professional or using the sub‚Äôs wiki for additional info.",1583762565.0

990,"Heads up: The federal government just filed suit against Navient, claiming they scammed millions of borrowers between 2010-2015 to the tune of $4 billion. This is huge.",27038,5ou70b,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/5ou70b/heads_up_the_federal_government_just_filed_suit/,1939,"The suit was filed January 18th 2017, by the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau (CFPB) against Navient. 

First, know that the CFPB has requested that the Court order Navient to comply with the following actions, among others: 

1. Restitution to consumers harmed by Navient's conduct; 

2. Disgorgement of all ill-gotten revenue


Here are the details of the allegations: 

From [consumer affairs .com](https://www.consumeraffairs.com/news/feds-sue-student-loan-servicer-navient-011817.html): 
>Specifically, the suit charges that Navient:
>> Fails to correctly apply or allocate borrower payments to their accounts;

>> Steers struggling borrowers toward paying more than they have to on loans;

>> Obscured information consumers needed to maintain their lower payments;

>> Deceived private student loan borrowers about requirements to release their co-signer from the loan; and

>> Harmed the credit of disabled borrowers, including severely injured veterans.

From the [LA Times](http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-navient-lawsuit-20170118-story.html): 
>In its lawsuit, the consumer agency alleged many other borrowers had problems enrolling in programs to reduce payments and Navient instead steered struggling borrowers into plans that made more money for Navient but saddled borrowers with higher costs.

>Specifically, the government alleged that Navient maintained compensation policies that encouraged customer service representatives to push borrowers into forbearance, which allows borrowers to suspend payments without defaulting but does not stop interest from accruing.

>However, most federal student-loan borrowers earned the right in 2009 to enroll in the less costly payment options that are based on their income.

>Although those plans save borrowers money, forbearance was more lucrative for Navient, the agency alleged because the company could enroll borrowers in forbearance in less time and with less staff.

>In all, the servicer slapped borrowers with additional interest charges of up to $4 billion by enrolling them in repeated forbearance plans from January 2010 to March 2015, according to the consumer agency. 

If you want to learn more about this, I highly encourage you to read the original complaint filed with the court by the CFPB. It is VERY readable (not filled with legalese) and reads as an absolutely scathing indictment of a company whose business practices targeted its most vulnerable customers in flagrant violation of the law. 

You can find the original complaint on the [consumer finance .gov website](http://files.consumerfinance.gov/f/documents/201701_cfpb_Navient-Pioneer-Credit-Recovery-complaint.pdf). They also [summarized the complaint on their website](http://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-sues-nations-largest-student-loan-company-navient-failing-borrowers-every-stage-repayment/). 

In the spirit of this sub, I'm sharing this information because there are plenty of people here who may have been a victim of these alleged practices. Including myself, as I've been paying down my Navient loans since 2012 and have several years to go. 

I'm going to read through the complaint again, and if anything important jumps out at me that I haven't mentioned, I'll update this post. 

**Edit:**
Additional allegations: 

(since July 2011) Disregard of borrower instructions when processing payments submitted by check with written instructions from the borrower specifying how the payment should be applied.

(Jan 2010-March 2015) Using uncharacteristically vague email titles like ‚ÄúNew Document Ready to View‚Äù to notify borrowers that they needed to renew their income-based repayment enrollment. During this time, the number of borrowers who did not timely renew their enrollment regularly exceeded 60% of borrowers and resulting, often, in capitalization of interest. 

**Edit:** There is no way to know how potentially impacted borrowers will be affected by the lawsuit. We will have to wait and see. Lawsuits of this magnitude often take a LONG time to get resolved.

The federal mileage rate is $0.58 per mile. This represents the actual cost to you and your car per mile driven. The driver drove 291 miles for the work he mentioned, which translates into expenses of $169.

In addition I use uber/lyft to get around the city for meeting up with friends, getting groceries, going to meetups etc and that added up a lot. I was so shocked by this because even though the charges are tiny up front they really add up. 

So a few months ago I invested in a nice road bike for $900 and its been solid so far and my Lyft usage dramatically went down. If I am going somewhere <2.5 miles I bike. I live in SF so hills can get pretty crazy so I also avoid areas that are further in the city. Its even cheaper than public transport - which would cost me close to $100 every month to get to work. Instead monthly bike maintenance is <$10 and I can use public transportation to go further into the city. I only use lyft/uber now if I am drunk or need to get to places that neither public transport or my bike can.

Something I thought this sub might enjoy

**Edit:** A lot of questions around why I used Lyft/Uber and Taxi so much when SF is such a walkable city and it has great public transportation. 

No real reason besides I was stupid and incredibly lazy with terrible habits. I moved to SF fresh out of college a year ago and I work in Tech so the salaries are pretty good. I wasn't disciplined about my finances for a while - as a matter of fact I wasn't until the last few months and then expenses racked up and I started building a credit balance. I used to use public transportation a lot and then I moved to a place where it was a little far so I got lazy and started taking Lyft and this became such a habit that 4-5 months in I was taking it everywhere. 

I also used to call it all the time whenever friends/family was in town and never split. $750 does say a lot about me. Bad habits are so easy to foster. But now I am more disciplined in this matter. I was careless. But I am self-aware enough to call myself out - only in this case I could've done it early; but that's alright because I did and made a lot of progress. 

So if you are 22 and are like me and have bad habits that alright. Call yourself out. Block a few hours on a weekend, and do nothing but understand your financial habits and make a budget to the last penny. It might anxiety at first but then you'll get a hold over it and it'll be alright.

**Edit:** Holy shit. This got way more attention than I wanted. A lot of good advice - thank you for that. Thank you to all the people that were being nice. To the ones that reached out to me to be mean - try to be nice. 

I did invest in a good U lock and I also have a cable lock. When I'm at work I take it straight to my desk but when I go grocery shopping I usually lock it with the U-lock and also use the cable lock with the tires. It worked well so far. 

I also cook everyday so that ~$50 a week on groceries and I eat out about ~30 worth every weekend. so about ~$350 in eating a month. A lot of people reached out asking for advice - I will get back to you this weekend. ",1504728816.0

He's actually super smart financially. Budgets his money, is on track to retire next year (he's 56 now), uses a credit card for all his spending for points, and owns approximately 14 rental properties.

Does this seem unreasonable??  Just seeking some guidance. 

Thanks yall!

Update: I weighed in at 250%.  Haven't received any response it's been a couple of hours since I sent my proposal.  I had to run the numbers several times.  My head hurt.

I told him he was completely oblivious about being in a ponzi, this only unchained a what I believed to be a cocaine induced speech saying that Safemoon was going to be the next Bitcoin and he was going to moon while buying *""lambos""* for his friends because he was no *""Bitch-ass paperhands""*. 

I'm a bank executive, so you can only imagine what a nightmare this is for me.

Don't know what the point of this post is, is not like my daughter is going to stop dating that idiot anyways. I'm scared about my daughter's future.

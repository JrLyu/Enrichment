I'm Irakli Guntaishvili, a Product Owner at 3Commas. As one of the leading cryptocurrency trade automation platforms, we're excited to introduce our latest innovation: the Signal Bot (beta). Signal Bot makes it easier to create a killer bot that can do more than just Grid or DCA strategies by simplifying the incorporation of TradingView alerts and signals directly into the bot. It receives alerts from TradingView and opens positions, offering users the ability to manage these positions by increasing or decreasing them as needed.

I'm here to address any inquiries you may have about automating crypto trading strategies, ranging from simple to complex, using signals from market intelligence platforms like TradingView. While my primary focus is on TradingView users, given that our latest bot, the Signal Bot, is tailored to their needs, I believe this conversation will be intriguing for anyone, including those who are not currently using TradingView or automated bot trading. It might serve as inspiration for you to explore these avenues further.

Signal Bot is primarily targeted at experienced crypto traders, but if you’re already using TradingView for your stock trading moves or for crypto market intelligence, you might find the transition to trading crypto with Signal Bot to not be the big leap it is for others. 

**What is 3Commas?** 

3Commas is a software platform that allows traders to automate their strategies at scale by using bots and other tools. Basically, our bots do all the chartwatching and buy/sell actions for you according to the conditions and parameters you decide. Our multi-pair bots can watch 200 coin pairs at the same time, hunting for deals that meet your conditions, with assistance from signals and indicators either set up by you or delivered via a trusted 3rd party such as TradingView. 

Between Signal Bot, DCA Bot, Grid Bot, and Smart Trade, almost any trading strategy you can dream up, including extremely complex maneuvers, can be executed with 3Commas trade facilitation tools. 

We are not a brokerage, and we do not have custody of client funds at any time. Our software works by creating an encrypted API connection between your 3Commas account and your account on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, OKX, etc. and sending commands to execute actions allowed by those exchanges. 

Start time: 16:00 UTC/GMT, November 30, 2023

End time: 18:00 UTC/GMT, December 2, 2023

This is a significant milestone as the community now has assurance that there will be no further changes to Moons’ contract in the future. This was the preferred option as it allows for Moons to easily retain existing exchange listings, there’s no need for a new token to be deployed, and the supply is now capped at \~83,000,000 Moons. 

The mod team will continue to work on bringing back and improving features such as memberships, governance and tipping. We are also exploring restarting distribution, though exactly how that will work remains to be seen.

Pfizer is already sitting right next to it's 52 week lows. I wonder how much of the news is already priced in.

Considering that covid vaccine / antiviral revenues would pretty much become insignificant in 1-2 years and now obesity drug tests are discontinued, it explains the huge drop in Pfizer's stock. However, rest of its portfolio is still going strong and it's sitting on plenty of cash.

I'm curious about others opinions on what 2024 is going to look like with T-Bills. I'm afraid the rates are going to go down, and I'm debating on whether I should start reinvesting my T-Bills in longer term T-Bills. I'm also thinking about possibly investing in a longer term Bond (10 year) to lock in a decent rate.

Do we think there's any chance the rates are going to rise? I'm thinking they may stay the same or lower. I know some people are predicting the Fed to Lower rates in early 2024, where some believe they Fed may hang tight until end of 2024.

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus reportedly discussing cheap bundle plan to take on Netflix,95,188i79a,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/188i79a/apple_tv_plus_and_paramount_plus_reportedly/,46,"https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus-and-paramount-plus-reportedly-discussing-cheap-bundle-plan-to-take-on-netflix

According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), two of the world's most underrated streamers have held talks about creating a cost-effective bundle to put a stop to Netflix's dominance of the streaming landscape. People familiar with the discussions reportedly told the WSJ that Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus aren't just looking to end Netflix's reign as the world's best streaming service. Per the US outlet's sources, the duo are also said to want to offer their services as a joint enterprise in a bid to save people money. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have had meaningful dialog about offering said bundle at a cheaper price than subscribing to both streamers separately – a deal that would surely pique the interest of customers operating on a budget.

If the WSJ's report is correct – the outlet is keen to stress talks are still in the early stages – the potential bundling of Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus into a single package could have a big impact on the wider streaming industry. For one, the world's eight biggest streamers have all raised their prices over the past 12 months – some, such as Disney Plus and Max, have done so twice in less than a year in the US. That's placed undue pressure on people who are subscribed to multiple services, with many forced to choose which one (or, at a push two) to stay with as the cost of living continues to bite.

The bundling of Paramount and Apple's platforms, then, would be seen as a significant move. Like their rivals, the pair have increased their subscription fees in 2023 – Apple TV Plus' major price hike was particularly irksome to me – and, while each one has some great content to offer customers, their back catalogs aren't on a par with Netflix, Prime Video, or even Hulu. Apple TV Plus' library only consists of first-party (albeit mostly terrific) offerings, while Paramount Plus doesn't have the strength in depth from first and third-party perspectives to compete with the world's most popular services.",1701453708.0

"let's be real. if a megacap stock drops 50%, 99% of y'all wouldn't touch it",766,187wwg2,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/187wwg2/lets_be_real_if_a_megacap_stock_drops_50_99_of/,355,"It's intriguing how recent market trends, like META's dramatic drop and subsequent recovery, reflect investor psychology more than rational analysis. Earlier this year, META was trading at a 75% discount from its all-time high, and the general sentiment was overwhelmingly negative, akin to buying Blockbuster stock in 2006.

However, following its near 300% rise from that low point, perceptions have shifted drastically. This flip-flop in attitude underlines a critical aspect of investing: market sentiment is often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. If META, or any big name for that matter, dropped by 50% again, history suggests that the majority of investors would shy away, not jump in.

This pattern is a classic example of the behavioral economics at play in the stock market, where fear and greed often override logical decision-making. It's why individual stock picking, especially based on market dips, can be so risky and unpredictable. It demonstrates the value of a more diversified, steady approach, like investing in index funds, which is likely a more suitable strategy for the majority of investors.",1701387693.0
"30-Day Challenge #12: Get involved with charity! (December, 2023)",2,188balt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188balt/30day_challenge_12_get_involved_with_charity/,1,"# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Get involved with charity!** As the end of the year approaches, there are many opportunities to extend oneself to be generous. The best advice is to ""secure your own oxygen mask first"" before helping others. The foundation of your generosity should be a [solid financial footing for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). Until you have achieved this, you should be circumspect about monetary giving.

# Monetary donations

If you have the means, consider monetary donations as these are the most efficient use of your charitable resources. Don't spend money to buy material goods that you intend to donate unless they are specifically requested by the charity itself. Cash donations allow for flexibility for the charity to get exactly what is needed at the right time in the right quantity at the right place to serve their mission.

Make sure you are contributing to charities that are good stewards of your hard-earned dollars by checking [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), [Give Well](https://www.givewell.org/), or another trusted source. If you do decide to donate cash, see if your employer matches contributions to extend the benefit. You may also consider donating to a charity that has assisted you or your loved ones in the past.

# Material donations

December is a great month in which to declutter your home, especially if you are participating in one of the many gift-giving holidays. Review your living space to determine what you can part with and how you can enjoy the reclaimed space. You can donate material goods to [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/), [Goodwill industries](https://www.goodwill.org/), [AmVets](http://amvets.org/), and local options near you such as food pantries.

# Time donations

Of course with all the donations coming in at this time of year, many organizations will need volunteers to help with the influx. If you are unable to donate money or material goods, you can consider donating your time. You can use [Volunteer Match](https://www.volunteermatch.org/) or [Catch a Fire](https://www.catchafire.org/) to get you started. There may also be local soup kitchens, churches, schools, or other organizations that need assistance.

# Alternative donations

There are other ways to be charitable if you don't have spare money, goods, or time. Here are some ideas:

* When making Amazon purchases, use the [Amazon smile program](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_se_dshb_aas_saas) to donate a portion of your purchase to a designated charity at no additional cost to you.
* Check with your local markets and grocers to see if they have programs such as [Kroger’s Community Rewards](https://www.kroger.com/topic/kroger-community-rewards-3) to direct donations to local charities.
* Keep an eye out for local restaurants and cafés that will donate a percentage of proceeds to charitable organizations, and patronize them during an eligible time period (schools are frequent beneficiaries of such programs).
* The [Make-a-wish foundation](http://wish.org/ways-to-help/giving/airline-miles), the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/donations/ways-to-donate/donate-airline-miles), and [Miles for Migrants](https://www.miles4migrants.org/) all accept donations of airline miles.
* You may be able to donate hotel or resort points. Contact the relevant hospitality group for details.
* You can elect to donate credit card rewards to charity.
* If your health and personal philosophy allow, consider becoming a blood/plasma donor or [registering for bone marrow donation](https://bethematch.org/). You can also consider registering as an organ donor and revising your will to donate your body to research after you pass.

# Taxes

Qualified charitable contributions remain [tax-deductible under the new tax law in the US](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/charitable-contributions/charitable-contributions/L6ZyAXJ4Y), but realizing a reduction in taxes is more difficult because of the increase in the standard deduction. If this is a significant factor for you, you may want to consider more advanced tax reduction strategies such as [donor advised funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/996iam/an_analysis_of_charitable_giving_using_donor/), [giving appreciated stock](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Donors-Often-Overlook-Benefits/152705), or [bunching your donations](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/itemize-bunching-tax-deductions.html) to meet the itemization threshold.

# Receiving charity

If you are in need this year, please consider being the good-faith recipient of a charity's assistance. 

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done one of the following things:

* Donated money, goods, or time to a charity or organization.
* Made an alternative donation or plans to donate.
* Received charitable assistance if in need.",1701435602.0

Avis charged me $1700 for the wrong car,215,188gwqp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188gwqp/avis_charged_me_1700_for_the_wrong_car/,72,"Traveled recently and picked up a Nissan Rogue for three days. Scanned out by someone at the gate and scanned back in when I returned it. Zero problems. In my hurry I didn't keep the receipt or any of the paperwork they gave me. I left it all in the car when I returned it.  

Now two weeks later, I get charged for Chevrolet Traverse for two weeks. Instead of charging me $250 for the Rogue, they charged me $1700 for a car I never took (Traverse). I called them twice in the past week and they're still ""working on it"". Meanwhile I'm out $1700.  

What should I do? Should I initiate a chargeback (Discover) or just wait? Since I have no supporting docs, I'm worried they're gonna conclude that I took the wrong car and nothing will be done.",1701450403.0
"I have a 30,000 emergency fund and my rent is $600.

Looking for advice. Late 20s, 50k salary. I’ve got 30k in a HYSA as an emergency fund because while my job is pretty stable, I feel like it might be difficult for me to replace if I lost it given my specific circumstances. No family close by to fall back on. No debt, not even a car loan.

I am also saving for a down payment on a house in a HYSA but I only have about 8k so far. 

I have about 5k in a 401k and contribute $500 a month. 

I feel like my independence hinges on this 30k. But I’m starting to wonder if there are better, risk free ways to put it somewhere that’s still accessible later. If I were to buy a house, I’m sure that 30k would be a great emergency fund and home repair fund. 

What would you do?",1701436355.0

As I navigate through college life, I realize the importance of being financially savvy early on. I have a few specific questions and would love some advice from this knowledgeable community.

I'm living off a combination of student loans, a part-time job, and some savings. Any tips on how to budget effectively to cover essentials and save a little?

I'm currently on student loans for my education. Any advice on managing these loans now to reduce stress post-graduation?

I've read about the importance of building good credit. Is it wise for someone my age to get a credit card for this purpose, and if so, what should I look out for?

Though retirement seems far away, I've heard starting to save early is crucial. How can I start, even with a limited income?

Here's a Breakdown of My Recent Strategy - SPX Long Strangle Plays,9,188a1xt,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/188a1xt/heres_a_breakdown_of_my_recent_strategy_spx_long/,25,"Here's a breakdown of my recent strategy: during afterhours trading sessions, I initiate a long Strangle on SPX around a 5-10 delta, with each leg costing $1.00. By purchasing Calls at $1.00 and Puts at $1.00, I close the Calls for $1.50 and the Puts for $0.65 after just a 6-point move up on ES, resulting in a $0.15 profit (+7.5%).

The core concept is to open a SPX Long Strangle daily, aiming to close the position for a 5-10% gain after an ES move - whether up or down - as long as it experiences some movement.

Today, I experimented with an ATM Strangle, with contracts averaging $19.30 and closing for $19.70 after a 7-point ES move, resulting in a profit of $0.40 (+2%). However, it appears the losing leg incurred more losses compared to the far OTM position. While ATM trades are preferable for commissions and fees, the OTM trades are way more effective, read further below.

I kept an eye on the OTM contracts – they would have yielded a much better result. After a 10-point move up, the calls, bought for $1.15, were at $2.30, and the puts, bought for $1.10, were at $0.50, resulting in a potential profit of $0.55 (+24%).

&#x200B;

To illustrate the impact, let's use a $16,000 account:

\- \*ATM Position:\*

Open for $19.30 x 8 contracts = $15,440

Close for $19.70 x 8 contracts = $15,760

$0.40 x 8 contracts = $320 Profit

&#x200B;

\- \*OTM Position:\*

Open for $2.25 x 69 contracts = $15,525

Close for $2.80 x 69 contracts = $15,760

$0.55 x 69 contracts = $3,795 Profit

&#x200B;

Even after accounting for commissions and fees, the OTM position proves to be remarkably more profitable vs the ATM position.

A couple of notes: Initiating these trades during extended hours and on news days has proven beneficial, capitalizing on the increasing IV throughout the day. However, it's crucial to close positions before news releases as IV will crush your ass if price does not rocket or melt.

I’d appreciate insights and discussions on refining this strategy.",1701431578.0

Lump sum (LS) vs dollar cost averaging (DCA),1,188a9jz,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/188a9jz/lump_sum_ls_vs_dollar_cost_averaging_dca/,1,"I guess this is a never-ending holy war but here are my two cents nobody seems to mention.  
  
The main argument for LS is that statistically it's more profitable to always be in the market and never bet against it. Doing DCA you're prolonging the time each of your money batch stays out of the market. Partially you're betting against the market doing this. It's been proven by a number of researches that LS wins in much more cases than DCA.  
  
However, nobody seems to mention the distribution of risk.  
  
With LS there's a small chance of getting terrible results, such as putting all your money into the market on a peak right before an economic depression which can last decades.  
  
With DCA there's a chance of getting negative returns too but their magnitude is much smaller.  
  
When you're doing DCA you are reducing the chances of getting better results but also you're reducing the chances of getting terrible results. I consider this as paying a fee against terrible outcomes, just like insurance.  
  
Is my reasoning fair or am I missing something?",1701432246.0

PMET's Latest Lithium Discovery Ignites Quebec's James Bay Region + A Lithium Junior in Close Proximity Worth the Watchlist: Arctic Fox Lithium (AFX.c),6,18748av,Investments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Investments/comments/18748av/pmets_latest_lithium_discovery_ignites_quebecs/,0,"**Unveiling the latest breakthrough in Quebec's James Bay Region, Patriot Battery Metals (PMET, 1.30B mcap) encountered \~100m of near-continuous-bearing pegmatite at its Corvette Lithium Property.** 

Home to the largest lithium pegmatite mineral resource in the Americas and boasting a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2M tonnes at 1.42% lithium oxide, this discovery solidified the region's stature as a key hub for active lithium projects. 

**Furthermore, this positive development augments the potential for the entire district, benefitting Canadian junior Arctic Fox Lithium (AFX.c) which holds three lithium projects located in close proximity to PMET's groundbreaking find.**

As detailed by President & CEO, Harry Chew, AFX successfully wrapped its Phase 1 exploration program at all three of its projects: [https://youtu.be/Xr0ziOpW9EM?si=wxPCrJVC-v\_YU2Sq](https://youtu.be/Xr0ziOpW9EM?si=wxPCrJVC-v_YU2Sq)

The incoming assays are poised to strengthen AFX's position in the industry as, once received, the results will be used to plan for its second phase of exploration on these properties.

AFX's Delta Lake, Kana Lake and Pontax North Projects all have favourable regional geological settings, close proximity to LCT pegmatite occurrences and deposits, and the potential for LCT pegmatites with multiple preliminary targets already outlined.

Demonstrating their immense potential, AFX's Delta Lake and Pontax North Projects are both located in close proximity Allkem (AKE, 8.5B Market Cap) as well as Critical Elements Lithium (CRE, 359.35M Market Cap) Rose Property where excellent lithium grades were returned, identifying several lithium-tantalum pegmatite trends including two kilometre long trends hosting multiple lithium, caesium and tantalum anomalies. 

Most notable, however, is AFX's Kana Lake which, situated the closest to PMET's Corvette Project and CV5 Pegmatite, has over 10 pegmatites including one substantial formation reaching over 500 meters and extending for over 2 kilometres, exhibiting substantial potential for new discoveries and growth.

On track to further delineate its resources, AFX could face a similar trajectory to the success that PMET experienced based on its proximity.

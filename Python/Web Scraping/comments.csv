250k losses on baba here. These guys are trading at 10 years ago prices. Says a lot about the dumb approach the ccp took to being a technological and financial superpower,1
![img](emote|t5_2th52|31226),1
"Baba wouldn't be down so much if it was only because of Xi got pissed at Jack Ma or Alibaba. Jack owns like <9% of the company at that time. Now the CCP has golden shares of all 3 tech titans BAT that give them over 50% voting power, Joe Tsai (a literal Canadian-Taiwanese who lives in America) owns more shares, Joe is the leading head now, and Son/Ma have both reduced shares while promising to sell more with ~~Xi/CCP/XiGoons~~ [""""""General public""""""](https://simplywall.st/stocks/us/retail/nyse-baba/alibaba-group-holding/ownership?blueprint=2696836&utm_medium=finance_user&utm_campaign=infographic&utm_source=yahoo) increasing their ownership share last 3years at these discounted prices. Baba has it's issues but it's because China is collapsing due to Xi ruining it on purpose for years.

Problem is XI really wanted to be emperor for life and decided to take THE BAT TO ALL OF CHINA the entire economy, every politician, any one with any influence, etcetc. [Xi's hit list is too long for WSB.](https://old.reddit.com/r/China/comments/16hespq/bankers_40_pay_cuts_show_the_china_dream_fading/k0hc4m5/?context=3)

That's why the economy isn't doing well, foreign investment has dried up, foreign expats/companies are moving out, Chinese natives are trying to move money/family/themselves too, and the only ones who aren't trying to get out are either corrupt fat cat yes men for Xi or lying flat because they've given up.",1

Nvidia. I owned it at $9,3
Nvda bought at 172 sold around 208. We had a lot of the stock.  I cry pretty much everyday,3
"Funnily pretty much all the ones I've bought at a major low and made a good chunk on but then let go and they continued to go up.

AMD in the 12.56$ days where it would sit there flat for weeks at a time. Dumped at the first spike to 14.50 and it went strait uphill for months after. Week hands wouldn't buy back in.,3
AMC I sold it at $70,3
"I bought 350k worth of Verizon stock at $30.81 only to listen to you degenerates talking about to much debt, dying company and fear mongering me into selling at $32 instead of holding and raking in $87,000 I get a few thousand bucks. Fuck you all. I will never listen to WSB advice again. Learned my lesson though do the opposite of what you dimbwits do  ![img](emote|t5_2th52|4271)",3

"I had Roku when it was in the low 20s and sold it when it hit 40, it’s poppin in the 100s now, I had tons of it",3
While it sucks that you missed out on more gains but. It’s important that you took profit. What if it goes down now? you’re gonna feel great because you sold and locked in profit.,3
"always nvda, it has to be nvda this year. Definitely the ""biggest selling too soon"" stock.",3

1) The SPAC kitty still has enough money to pay for the fines and costs associated with the merger.
2) The founders of Truth Social have issued themselves millions of shares at pennies apiece, so they will cash in even if the stock drops precipitously. Plus, Truth Social is circling the drain (few users, no money, plenty of debt). Therefore, it's possible that investors will be diluted but still end up making money on their investment.",9

I believe that the stock market is a great place to invest your money. I particularly like stocks that are undervalued and have good potential for growth. I also believe that it is important to diversify your portfolio so you don't put all your eggs in one basket.,10

">The discussion is still in early stages and may not lead to a deal, the report said. It’s unclear how much Apple or Paramount would discount their services if they were bundled together.

Apple TV+ costs $4.99 per month while Paramount+ starts at $5.99 per month. A bundle of the two services could entice customers to sign up for both streaming platforms and help Apple compete with Disney+, which offers a bundle of its various streaming offerings for $12.99 per month",17

>TL;DR: Does the reason the S&P keeps growing and is pretty much 'safe' over long time periods is because it just keeps attracting more investors?",25
How high are you?,25
Hey everyone! This guy figured out the stock market! Can’t go tits up,25
"Nope.  

As the value of a company increases, people will invest more money, and it is possible to determine objectively the value of a company without looking to the opinion of investors.  It's not groupthink to serious investors.  Companies like Ford own manufacturing plants, trade secrets, staff knowledge, licenses, sourcing agreements.  All those things are worth something and none of those are valuable because of the stock markets.

And the S&P 500 goes up in vaue only so long as the value of the top 500 companies keeps growing.  It doesn't always.  There have been notable times when it hasn't",25
">You have correctly identified one of the key reasons why the stock market keeps growing. As more people invest in it, and as confidence in the stock market increases, it becomes a self-reinforcing cycle. The other key reason is that companies continue to grow and expand their operations, which results in increased profits and share prices. So as long as these two factors remain strong, the stock market will continue to grow over time.",25
"As corporate profits rise, they also raise their dividends and buy back more shares.

If stocks become less popular which leads to stagnating prices, then the dividend yields rise as companies raise their dividends and the buybacks become more efficient because corporate profits are growing faster than stock prices. These more efficient buybacks allow companies to reduce their share count faster and support an even higher dividend.

So even if everyone leaves, then you just get your returns from dividends and it becomes even better for the people who remain and continue investing because companies become more able to raise dividends faster due to super efficient buybacks.

On the other hand, if more investors get interested in the market, you might see prices initially rise faster as more people pile in, but the rate of increase slows down as most people get fully invested and there are fewer new investors left to come in. If everyone was fully invested our rate of return going forward would be very poor as people are only able to trickle money in slowly, dividend yields are low, and buybacks are inefficient.

Generally when the demand for stocks exceeds the earnings growth of public companies, that's a bubble and it either plateaus until earnings catch up or it pops somehow.",25
"The S&P 500 is considered a ""large blend"" meaning you get both value and growth stocks. Since it's impossible to outperform the stock market over a 15-90 year period, it's best to say that it's the ""safest bet"". Meaning the worst you can do is the S&P 500 returns.

The stock market will continue to go up forever because of growth and productivity. Apple and Microsoft could come and go but the index will still prevail over time. 

I'm still a believer of individual stocks, but index funds have made it so that most common people who are not research savvy or have time to babysit their stocks can do well in the stock market. 

And as long as the economy keeps growing then the stock market will be plain and simple.",25
"So uhhhhh...what happened from 2000-2014, or 1968-1982?

Now, **put down the pipe and step away from the keyboard OP!**",25
The market cap is not the total amount of money invested in an asset. It’s simply the shares x the last price paid. Your conclusion that the S&P constituents attract 10% more $s each year makes no sense.,25
You want the good or the bad news?,25
"SP500 is the 500 largest market cap companies in the US and it adds/subtracts companies in the index if they reach top 500 or fall below it. Hence, in the long run, the index will always go up because it has to",25
Yes,25
Hi how are you,25
"Thanks Vismod, appreciate that",25
Take dividends into account to see the whole picture,25

If I had boobs like that…,32
"**Worth $20-25 based on EBITDA.** ***First way to look at it***: Companies that exist within the Operations and Services segment of the Real Estate sector trade at an average EBITDA multiple of 9x. However, Geo Group only trades at 6.4x its 2023E EBITDA of $497.5 million. If Geo Group were to be valued at the multiple given to its peers, its shares would be worth at $20.94 per share. ***Second way to look at it***: it should also be noted that approximately half of Geo Group’s operating income is generated from their Electronic Monitoring Services Division. Electronic Monitoring generates higher margins and has higher growth potential than companies that exist within the Operations and Services segment of the Real Estate sector. Therefore, a much higher multiple should be placed on the earnings from that business. Overall, to be more accurate, one should actually apply a 9x multiple only to the traditional half of Geo Group’s business and a higher 15x multiple to the Electronic Monitoring half of the business. This results in a blended multiple of 12x. This multiple is not excessive (it is actually in line with the overall stock market) and results in a Geo Group valuation of $24.97 per share.

Also, I'll post about an alternative valuation methodology which indicates the stock could be worth as much as $40 per share on Monday.",32

">It's hard to say how Argentina will effect the US economy, if at all. However, I do think that if they switch to using the US dollar as their currency, it could help combat inflation in the short-term. Inflation is always a risk when interest rates are cut, but having more demand for the US dollar should help offset some of that risk.",39
">Edit: upon further research this is based around the most simplistic view of the situation, however I feel like it still applies.

There's so much you don't consider I don't even know where to start. And I'm an armchair economist at best.

Who's going to supply them the money ? They can't just declare that their pesos are $$$ now, they need to get this money somehow, and they are close to pariah status at the moment. They've been given numerous loans by various countries and organizations over the years and owed north of $250 bil last time I've checked. They'd need another $100+ bil to replace peso with usd. Someone willing to give them that much would certainly demand so much in return politically and economically that it could probably lead to a revolt.

Even if they had the money, there's a whole set of problems with distributing it to accounts and in the form of physical cash to their populace, determining the proper conversion rates, people hoarding pesos between conversion rate announcement and actual conversion happening etc. Can be done but isn't as easy as it seems, Germany did replace eastern mark  during the unification in 1990 but it wasn't without issues, and done by a country way more organized and way less corrupt than Argentina.

As things stand now, after winning the elections Milei changed tune from ""dollarization, period"" to ""dollarization is the end goal in the future"" and went to NYC and Washington to talk with US and IMF about current debt obligations, all this before he was even officially sworn as the president.

And sucking out $100 bil from US money supply won't do anything significant to combat the inflation.",39
"Same as Ecuador's dollarization. None. Pay attention to domestic indicators and what the Fed is doing. Argentina won't have an effect on the US, but the US is sure going to have an affect on Argentina. 

Maybe beef gets cheaper though? I want some steaks now.",39
Would the imports of Malbec wine become easier with the Argentinian dollar?,39
"New Economy minister already told no dollar, no bc closure.",39
Thank you for agreeing with me VM.,39
"It isn't  that hard,

\- stop printing new pesos

\- physically destroy existing pesos that are deposited in banks

\- only allow USD bank withdrawals at a fixed exchange rate

\- set a phase out date (eg January 1 2026)  where pesos will no longer be legal tender

Edit:

They can just buy physical dollars from the US mint.. ***One*** pallet of $100 notes is $10 billion",39
"Argentina is lovely, I quite love the area in the Andes around Bariloche.  They have been buying up the USD at the blue rate for 20+ years; the common person has been trying to dollarize all that time.


I might have a slight pull down on inflation, but that depends on the money printer going BRRRR.  Maybe I am a mad lad, but I am a two more hikes kinda guy.


There are some excellent hikes around Mt. Tronador.",39
"The Europeans could switch so easily bc they could print the new currency, euros. Where is Argentina going to get usd from. You hope they have enough reserves.",39
"I have heard some transactions such as buying cars bikes and kitchen appliances are preferable in dollar. Strange how it was kind of implemented by their people before the government took the idea. 

I would say a great idea to stabilise their currency, they can start working other things out once their money is in a sound manner!",39
"I think the entire point is that they can't print it. The idea is to force austerity by using a currency they can't control. It's kind of like going with gold or bitcoin in that sense.

Probably will cause a deep recession in Argentina if it really happens but may actually be good in the long run idk.",39
You're missing my point. Dollarization is difficult if you do not have usd reserves to implement it. Declaring it doesn't make it so.,39
Would you make the same argument if they wanted to switch to gold backed currency? They can figure out some way to obtain it. Maybe do some kind of transition to taxes/tariffs in the new currency and require companies to use it for trade.,39

TLDR: Yolo dell calls,40
Just bought a R16 Alienware To lose money with my homies,40
Isn’t this the same guy who almost blew up his account going in hard on SNOW puts?,40
"I wrote this in another dell post:

Dell's recent AI bookings were reported to be around $150M with Imbue.
Their quarterly revenue is supposed to be over $23B. I don't think this is the play. Major AI hype over the last few months - the stock has doubled since summer...but they're only getting these tiny $100MM AI deals??

I think this is gonna faceplant tomorrow a la NVDA's ER report last week. Guidance in hardware is gonna continue declining, while their AI tech is growing, it's a drop in the bucket. 

I'm an enterprise IT manager and this year has been the least amount of hardware I've ordered since 2020, by a wide margin. (2020+21 were insane).

Also, Cramer was pushing this shit yesterday on TV. The stock has had a massive 70% run-up since July's bottom. I think whatever gains are already priced in, and the market is going to correct here to around $65 over the next month.

Inverse Cramer, win the game. 12/15 $72P",40
Dell smells,40

"From what I understand (people, correct me if I'm wrong), but there is no such thing as ""long term gains"" in Canada. 

Capital gains is indeed only 50% taxable. If you bought, say, 2 BTC at a 30k average and you sell one for 40k, you'll be taxed on the 10k you made. 

50% = 5k, so you'll pay taxes on that 5k relative to your income bracket. If your marginal tax rate is 15%, that means you'll pay 750$ in taxes.

If you later sell your other BTC at 50k, you're going to be taxed on 50% of 20k capital gains, according to your tax bracket.

"It is complicated so I would recommend using a service like Koinly, or Zen Ledger. There are quite a few more but those are the two I found to be most user-friendly.",48
You can calculate it either as FIFO (first in first out) or LIFO (last in first out) or possibly other ways. So when you sell a part you can either pretend that particular one was the first one you ever bought or the last one you bought and then calculate the gains accordingly. But you have to stay consistent. You have to use the same method you pick once for all of the sales. You can’t pick and chose for each transaction.,48
"Use Koinly to figure it all out.  It’s pretty simple.  Depending upon the volume, it can be free.",48

I could be wrong but when sending to cold wallet its same as a taxable event no?? Like how is it distinguishable between a wallet YOU own and another wallet you SOLD to ?? I have included the end of year printout from every exchange showing the value when purchased and when transferred so doesn’t that mean the taxes have been accounted for ?? Then its just the difference between the value on the day transferred compared to value on day sold ( also in USA there’s long term holdings va short term gains ) please tell me if I’m wrong as this is how I’ve been moving forward,48
"gotcha, thanks!",48
[deleted],48
"I'll look into those for sure, thanks stranger!",48
Not in canada. We do acb,48
It's not a taxable event sending to a cold wallet. There was no trade between wallets so it's not taxable. If you sent BTC and then you end up with cash in the bank then that's taxable.,48
"Its half of the gains multiplied by the tax bracket. So if you bought at $50 and sold at $100, 50% of the gain would be $50. You then take that $25 and multiply by your tax bracket - which if you are making the minimum wage will be 15%, or up to 48% if you're a high income earner. The trick is you want to reduce your income if you plan on selling assets that year, so your tax bracket won't eat into those gains.",48

It's not always that simple, and not all contract interactions are fool proof. For the contract you posted I don't see any available write functions.

&#x200B;

edit:

In Metamask you can choose a manual gas limit, but it's a little bit hidden - are you sure it's not working? [This](https://i.imgur.com/KcTGlgU.jpg) is how you do it.",50
Just found out why the decentralized claim is mostly bullshit.,50
"Heya, I can help here. So seems like https://bscscan.com/address/0xd65e1f00606f8bdf73e82ff0424dd57bf4c51c43 is the contract address - however, there are no write functions available via BSCScan so you can't interact via the website.  
The thing you have to understand is that all contract interactions are essentially a normal transaction with some hex data attached to tell the contract what function to call. If you look at the first withdraw transaction made to the smart contract:  
https://bscscan.com/tx/0xb0e81272e77cb9db83d9430779c3d9d32da0bfdb252be70461264e31a6f220ca  
It is a redemption of 0.411997432983440201 acsTUSD. The input data reads ""0x2e1a7d4d00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005b7b57b8159cb49"" which can be split into two parts. The first 4 bytes ""0x2e1a7d4d"" represents the 'withdraw' function, while \`00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005b7b57b8159cb49\` is 411997432983440201 in decimal padded to 32 bytes (64 chars) - you can use an online tool like https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/hex-to-decimal.html to check. Note how this matches the redemption amount of acsTUSD.  
To confirm, we can look at a second withdraw attempt: https://bscscan.com/tx/0xa1e6e9ae0afbfcd0af2b1b22c33d48aff22d42919120d9f32df102386e1b18c9  
Input data reads: ""0x2e1a7d4d00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b507045d3b7909"". Again, the first 4 bytes ""0x2e1a7d4d"" represents the 'withdraw' function. The remaining ""00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000b507045d3b7909"" represents 50954686110071049 in decimal which matches the redemption amount of 0.050954686110071049 acsTUSD.  
So now that we can match input data to withdrawals, how do we actually construct a tx with custom input data? Go to Metamask -> Advanced Settings -> Show hex data and set it to on.  
Then simply construct a tx to the contract address (0xd65e1f00606f8bdf73e82ff0424dd57bf4c51c43) and create your own withdraw command. So start with 0x2e1a7d4d for the withdraw function, then figure out how much acsTUSD you have, convert it to hex and attempt to withdraw. i.e. if etherscan said you had 1.234 acsTUSD, this would convert to 1234000000000000000 (18 decimal places) which converts to a hex of 11200C7644D50000 using https://www.rapidtables.com/convert/number/decimal-to-hex.html. Then simply pad this with zeros to 64 chars using a tool like https://www.tools4noobs.com/online\_php\_functions/strlen/https://www.tools4noobs.com/online\_php\_functions/strlen/ giving you \`00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011200C7644D50000\`. And thus your custom hex data to withdraw 1.234 acsTUSD is 0x2e1a7d4d00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011200C7644D50000. Paste that in the hex data field, and metamask should autoupdate your gas estimate. Send that tx through and you should hopefully get your funds if no contract exploits or anything has happened with Valas TUSD and Acryptos Vault",50
"Thank you for your reply! 

I don't even get to the part where I can choose the gas limit, I get an error before the transaction prompt even gets activated.

"Happy to provide dev resources on these, but unless you are code savvy, it kind of is just a ""trust me bro"" thing as it looks sketchy as shit. I believe you should also be able to transfer your acsTUSD to a fresh wallet as well as a small amount of BNB and do this on a burner wallet if you're paranoid.",50
"Ok, so I see the error - you can't fix it with MM as far as I see.

You could probably use something like web3 from python to interact with the contract yourself, but that would require you to have some coding experience. I did something like this once before, but never to an (to me) unknown contract.

If you decide to do something with this, make sure to clear the address completely out (on all chains) except a little bit for gas.",50

It was about how to manually construct the hexdata for the withdraw transaction. Pretty much like the sushi link in the other comment but a bit more convoluted (since the contract isn't verified with any write functions on bscscan). Happy to reply with the text if you send me a DM.,50
I'm pretty sure it can still be retrieved by hand with a manual interaction - which requires some work and you need to talk to an endpoint directly. But your best bet for now is to wait for them to reply and add a custom option for you.,50

Ever.  


I've seen this all before:  
The early internet adopters envisioned a decentralized global communications network with extremely low barriers to entry for anyone who wished to create a site and share information.  


But this was only true for nerds in a period before things hit critical mass.  


Corporations came in and created their own content aggregating ecosystems.  
Now the vast majority of users spend almost all of their internet time on one of these platforms. To many people one or two apps on their phone ARE the internet.  


The majority of people will always flock to centralized systems; it's just human nature.   
Sure there is an extremely small minority using Tor or visiting Joe Schmo's custom bb forum, but that is not for the masses.  


And the same will be true for crypto. Self-custody will never, EVER, hit critical mass.  
DeFi in its current form will never, EVER, hit critical mass.

The technology will be used no doubt, but it will be used by the finance titans.

"Self-custody, no matter the user experience, runs counter to human psychology.

Institutional investment is anathema to crypto philosophy.

Public trust in the crypto space is guttered and will likely never recover. Crypto will not go away, but it is unlikely to moon the way it did a couple years ago ever again because small-time new users are no longer interested and we are a long ways away from another era of cheap money for startups.",52

"It's absolutely not meaningless. Open source means that the manufacturer/developer can not restrict who can audit the code.

Also even the existence of this fact creates automatically a dynamic where the company will probably not put out code that has backdoors and shady practices in it because they already know it may be discovered. They don't have that incentive if it's closed.

But, it is important that builds are reproducible, and a lot of the projects in Bitcoin for example that is the case. Then a user can know that the software they use actually originated from the open source code that is out there.",53

Following Canada and Europe, BCH and LTC are practically identical to BTC and ETH. So that's where I'd place my bet assuming more funds get approved in the US. 

Not that I think those are the most deserving today, but tradfi moves slower than crypto. BCH and LTC are forks of BTC, so the Boomers understand it.",54

"Gaming doesn't need crypto.  Crypto companies are trying to find a way to use gaming to make money.  I don't see any advantage for a gaming company to integrate crypto into their games.   The only use case for crypto in gaming is using the blockchain to facilitate ownership and resale of games themselves using NFTs, and even then I doubt it'll happen because why would gaming companies want a secondary market for their games when they can continue to sell fresh copies?",55
Or don't get any players to begin with.,55
"Ethereum is a relatively slow chain, with a big demand behind it. To solve this problem, they have a fee structure model that fluctuates the fees you pay, based on the demand of the time you are trying to use it.

So, if there are many people that are trying to make transactions on Ethereum, at a particular moment, the gas fees are high (in the event of a big mint they could go to the hundreds or even thousands of dollars in ETH). In some low-traffic hours (especially in the early morning US hours, and weekends) the fees are lower.

When you are trying to swap a coin on the Ethereum chain, you are using a Decentralized Exchange (DEX), which has a small percentage fee (\~0.3%) on your purchase, which varies among DEXes, and a ""flat gas fee"" which is based -as I said earlier- on how busy is the network at the moment.

The last weeks, Ethereum is busy and the fees are high. Especially for smart contract interactions, which are more complex (like a swap) they are really high. You were lucky with the $16 gas fee to be honest.

Also, to clarify what you said, when you sell your tokens that you purchased to cash-out, if they have been up in value, you won't pay thousands of dollars in gas fees. As I said, the gas fee, is based on the traffic of the network and the complexity of the transaction. So, the complexity will remain the same (you did and you will do a swap), so the only thing that it will change is the traffic on the Ethereum blockchain. If it is less loaded than now, you will pay a smaller fee than the 16$ you paid now, if it is more loaded, more.

So, what you should do? Ethereum blockchain is extremely expensive, especially if you are not doing big transfers or swaps. So, the best way, is to buy your ERC-20 tokens from a Centralized Exchange (CEX) if they offer them (so if you are not buying shitcoin territory tokens), because you will not pay the transaction fee, just the fee that the specific CEX imposes. Big exchanges are relatively cheap, if you trade the coins and tokens in their spot market interface.

You should always remind yourself though, that if you want your ERC-20 tokens on your personal wallet (which is good for decentralization) you will pay a relatively big withdrawal fee from a CEX, because... Ethereum.

One, other solution, is to leverage some layer-2 on Ethereum, such as Optimism or Arbitrum, and buy your Ethereum tokens using a DEX that supports those networks. But, before starting to experiment with layer-2s and side chains, you should first understand them, and the pros and cons that they have.

Good luck, whatever you decide to do.",56
"Just use Solana bro, free gas and no headaches",56
"I wouldn't make any swaps on Ethereum. Way too expensive. Wait for the bull market... 150$ fee for 1 transaction haha.

You can use L2 solutions. Arbitrum works like a charm. You can easily bridge your funds from Eth mainnet to Arb and then do your thing there.

If you are withdrawing your funds from CEX, you don't even need to pay bridge fee. For example, on binance I can withdraw my ETH for 0.4 usd to Arbitrum and do my thing there.",56
"Use a L2?

If you are crying about this in a bear market...

Just wait.",56
"gas fees are related to network congestion it's not a percentage of the dollar amount you are swapping, you are paying for your transaction to be included in a block so if there is increased traffic you'll have to pay more",56
"It’s madness to me that the number 2 crypto has such absurd fees and slow transactions.

FYI, other cryptos, like XRP and Algo, have fees less than 1 cent and transactions take seconds.",56
"You can check what gas rates currently are so you can do your trades during slow times

https://etherscan.io/gastracker",56
">they charged me a $16 gas fee

Who is ""they""?",56
Gotcha so the fee isn’t really based on the quantity or percentage of the transaction. Thanks for this info!,56
"I want to clarify, the gas fee is in eth. If eth hits one million tomorrow due to institutions and stuff, you still pay the same cost in eth, so yes, you pay way more if eth moons.

Layer 2 networks reduce cost by bundling many entries into a larger summary and submits that to the main chain. I might be off on layer 2.

Same with BTC, the cost to transact is in BTC, so assuming same traffic, a higher BTC means a higher cost to transact.

Not to op, you can write off the fees from earnings. So you buy and sell and make 100 dollars profit but spent 20 on fees, you only pay on the 80",56
the ye they,56
"Even if it was though, your post makes no sense. You’re talking about turning $200 into “hundreds of thousands of dollars” and then whining about fees? 

1. You’re not going 1000x, relax. 

2. If you do, you eat the fees and be grateful for the $184,000 you just made (assuming the fees were the same percentage).

“Undervalued” usually means “not undervalued.”,66
We all here for the tech. Trust me bro.,66
"Most price action comes from hype…I’m more of a value investor when it comes to traditional stocks so any crypto I invest in I try and apply some logic and thought. Often traditional metrics are hard to apply.

Basic mcap based on total supply is a good starting point for me. Essential to know and fundamental to establishing if it is overvalued.

Function of the token. Really depends on what the token is doing. Is it a currency or is it for utility or is it just some shitcoin. An easy one I tend to avoid are governance tokens as I can’t see the valuations that are often attributed to these.

Centralised or decentralised is also a big consideration, some tokens that are more ripe for value analysis often are the products of a company or are tied to the success of some real world application. These are essentially centralised, having a real world point of failure or external dependency which will trump any of the tokenomics and often makes it too risky.

Earnings. This is a tricky one. In the crypto world the earnings can be a fee share from say a CEX, an interest payment from staking your coins or a sales share/ utility fee share. As noted depends on utility of token. For example Chainlink is a pricing oracle that DeFi applications will pay a fee to use the price feed generated by their protocol. I see this as pretty good use case (this is on my hit list to do some numbers on)

Velocity of token. This is also worth considering. If there are billions of tokens and the interaction is seconds then the high velocity means in longer term the supply will always be high and therefore price will not increase (unless there is clear demand use case). Bitcoin is a good example of a low velocity coin, where most of these are essentially locked away, with low supply available at any time.

I’ll add some more if I have time.",66
"Well, to BTC specifically... “If you don't believe me or don't get it, I don't have time to try to convince you, sorry.”

― Satoshi Nakamoto

The rest, who knows.",66
"There are plenty of cash flow and similar metrics you can look at especially in DeFi if you like those sort of things. 

Dune analytics, DeFi llama… maybe a good place to start exploring.",66
"My take, thinking out loud: Undervalued means the token hasn't become widely known or popular yet BUT it has a lot of potential such as a new technical feature, new utility, exciting upcoming update (e.g. EIPs), a major improvement in an existing technical aspect that puts it over top of competitors (e.g. faster transactions), has attractive tokenomics that other tokens don't have, or maybe implements a potential upcoming big wave (e.g. liquid staking).

So basically that it has the potential to break out for a reason, not just being a meme coin, but hasn't broken out yet.

Maybe ""break out"" isn't the best phrase. Depends on your time frame. Some people might want to gauge the value of a token over the course of years, others might be ok with more risk and be looking at weeks or months.

Undervalued is a prediction or opinion. A new token with a hella cool new feature may never catch on despite the new feature.

By contrast the idea of being overvalued is less subjective because you can look at the current market cap and how much it's grown over recent time and compare that to what the token has to offer. Still, there's that same subjective aspect of measuring the value of what the token has to offer.

Edit: Other comments reminded me of TVL. A spike in TVL yet still low market cap could mean a token is undervalued and poised to jump. On the non-technical side of things, a token that's being talked about a lot on social media but with a low mc could be undervalued because all the talk could trigger trend algorithms like twitter to start showing that token in people's recommended posts or high up in search results. That creates a situation like a pile of gun powder just waiting for a spark.",66
Undervalued in the shitcoin space means someone watched a YouTube video about a coin promising 1000x returns. It hasn't turned this person's pocket change into billions yet so it's undervalued.,66
" 'undervalued' gems

&#x200B;

it's crypto, any price above 0 is overvalued.",66
"If crypto was just monopoly money with no utility, it would just be hype and speculation driven like collectible JPG NFTs or Beanie Babies.

But since it's also a technology, with not only utility as financial tools and utility tokens, but it also functions as an alternative currency and money with unique characteristics that we didn't have before.

So yea, part of it is beanie babies, but it's also part tech solution, part alternative currency, part international money, and part digital gold.

So there's actually many more fundamentals with underlying value. The easiest fundamental to estimate is the tokenomics. The harder one to evaluate is the problem solving and how its utility will be adopted. Some of the bigger adoption is behind the scenes in the business world. 

What's even tougher to evaluate is limitless technology like smart contracts. The sky is the limit on what you can do with smart contracts. So the right chain could explode into incredible tech utility that could be found in almost every industry. Or it could die out and be taken over by a better chain.",66
Undervalued in crypto is a made up concept used to try and give authority to made up opinions espoused by crypto influencers.  Conceptually ‘undervalued’ cannot exist in the crypto space.,66
"""Undervalued"" means ""please buy so I can sell for a higher price"". There is no such thing as undervalued, because hype is easy come, easy go.

And nobody knows any ""secret metrics"", because people don't really care about metrics. They're throwing their life savings at worthless projects",66
Undervalued - somebody is trying to pump his bags or even dump on you.,66

Everybody hating on the crypto with the 5th largest market cap must’ve really been burned bad buying at the top,67
"cool, so you can put $50 into crypto and gamble with the other $450",67
"As far as bitcoin goes you are not gambling - I know at lot of cave dwelling guys on here (that think buying a coffee is a luxury) will tell you that crypto is risky etc - but look, once the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock files for a BTC ETF, you are no longer gambling but rather investing, and with an asset that’s likely to outperform stocks and real estate for the foreseeable future.

That being said, for those small amounts I’d consider going for something with a lower market cap and higher upside potential.  I’m not a fan of XRP personally but I guess it’s survived all these years, however it is a $32bn market cap so it’s not exactly going to give you 50-100x returns like some coins can

Don’t just take my advice, but look into solid projects that have IRL utility and are sitting around the $200-500m market cap levels - ideally on big exchanges like Binance or Coinbase - here’s a few examples but like I said do your own research and don’t listen to coin recommendations from random internet strangers :

$OCEAN - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ocean-protocol

$ROSE - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/oasis-network

$MINA - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/mina-protocol

$TRAC - https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/origintrail

These are just examples that I personally like and have done research on, and aren’t into the crazy high valuations yet… I’m sure you can filter coingecko by $100m - $500m market cap and find other things too 

Ultimately BTC is the lowest risk by far, but with that comes the lowest potential upside - so maybe stick with $50 BTC plus $50 into a smaller cap project?  

Just my 2c and as always this is NFA

Good luck mate 👍",67

Here is the story about VGX. Voyager, a now defunct and bankrupt CEX also sold their coin called VGX. If you held VGX, especially in large amounts, you would earn more interest/return from their ""EARN"" program, which was an unsecured loan program.

Search for this post in reddit to view those Redditors that lost it all, ""How much did everyone have on voyager? I had 30k and my husband 150k ish . Trying to feel better""

"..everyone is going to love having to forge 24 word phrases into iron and wood just to access their money..i love crypto, the communities and what it represents and is capable of but lets get real...until the whole mess of seed phrases and hard wallets is streamlined and easy we wont have mass adoption .",69

There’s legit no way to store your seed phrase that satisfies this sub,69
I thought plain text was a pen and paper and was about to call BS when I read the title.  Pen on paper in a safe is the way to go,69
what other preventive options do you recommend to avoid getting malware on your phone altogether?,69
Amen. Convenience is what brought me in. People won't use a thing if it feels like there are extra steps or risks just to use their own money.,69
"this might be a stupid idea, but what about generating mnemonic and all of the entropy from something simmilar to touch id? you generally have all od your fingers all of the time with you.. and if your device didnt support fingerprint scanning, then you could use a standard mnemonic seed phrase generation process?

I mean this solution would have throwbacks such as inability to use this standard by people who doesnt have a device with fingerprint scanner, but they could just choose an option to generate a standard/random mnemonic??
And there could be an issue with inability to generate infinite number of prv keys from same fingerprint scan.

But hey, wallet import would be easier right..??",69
We can use the banks to store the seed phrases.,69
"If someone knew you had a bunch of crypto and who you were they could also do targeted actions, all the need to do is park a van outside your house, deauth a device and get it to connect to their stronger WiFi router in the van with the same name of your network, get the WiFi password and then pivot from there, or directly ARP/DNS poison redirect your device to a fake website which autodownloads malware. 
Basicly never tell anyone or family you got crypto",69
I think both are potential avenues for compromise. I don't have deep knowledge of the real malware out there but I've read about installing cracked software or other social engineering techniques. [This article from secureworks](https://www.secureworks.com/research/cryptocurrency-stealing-malware-landscape) has some examples I found interesting.,69
"Hide seed in a nickelback CD 💿, no one ever gonna check",69
"While I agree with both of you, it needs to also be said that the primary reason the general public thinks it needs the current (and very corrupted) financial system is because of how convenient it is for them to use. 

The vast majority of these people don't even know how finance works at the levels beyond their own personal finances, and they don't care for the most part. Especially in the West. Convenience is King, and people will follow that addiction at any cost, right into the grave if that's where it leads them. It always reminds me of my ""socialist"" friends who have a talking refrigerator.. they don't actually give a fuck that their brand new phones are made by layers and layers of slave labor, they want their pizza delivered on time and their ""news"" ingested in easily digested sound bytes and 30 second video clips. 

It's not about security versus convenience, it's about finding a balance between the two that doesn't compromise either. It's a sliding scale that can go too far in one direction, but right now I don't mind the hassle of the current setups. Just like I don't mind keeping precious metals in my own possession in an actual safe.",69
"Good idea.  Then what if we change the seed phrase to something more user friendly, like... I don't know, a physical card of some sort, which requires a pin to use it?",69
"Yeah I made a post awhile back. Someone was able to social engineer their way into my phone by doing a sim swap through the actual phone company. My phone literally just shut off and someone else was locking me out of all my crypto apps. Luckily I have a hardware wallet and a ton of security settings on my trading accounts. Had I not been on my game, someone could have wiped me completely clean. Luckily I was able to act fast and stop them from getting anything. Probably the scariest few hours of my life.",69

"""Tokenomics"" is Code, and Code is ""Law"".

Like ""Law"", it can be changed and/or forked. Just need the proper path for that to happen.

Laws are changed and even Constitutions are changed/amended all the time, you think it'll be any different if instead of a democratic elected body it's a bunch of greedy neckbearded programming nerds in their basement?

Lesson learned.",74
"Unless otherwise proven, it should be assumed that any entity will change tokenomics if it's in their best interest to do so.",74
All blockchains can make whatever changes they want as long as they have the consensus of the validators. Obviously that's easier to achieve for some blockchains than others.,74
"Changes can be good or bad, but usually it just means the project is centralized no matter how they play it off.",74
They could also just change contracts.. like gala.. whenever they do a version 2.. it's normally when they want to cut people our of the team or if they just need to start over..,74
"It is a thing, and can lead to some pretty 🔥tokenomics! For example, Defi Kingdoms updated their tokenomics when they left the Harmony chain! $Jewel used to have a supply of 500 mil with like 375 mil of it about to be unlocked in the middle of the bear market and kill the currency. Instead, they burnt the locked tokens, *making the supply 125 mil and fully issued* 

Plus, being the First and biggest AVAX subnet, they actually burn $Jewel as gas!

As of today, 39.81 million $Jewel staked in Jeweler
2.83 million $Jewel has been burnt. 

Best part? Only at .13cents per $Jewel or a mkt cap of only 15mil makes DefiKingdoms a hidden gem! 

Remember, $jewel can only be bought through the DefiKingdoms DEX on DFK Chain (AVAX Subnet) or on the Klaytyn Network DefiKingdoms DEX",74
"With Lukso there was a vote, which you highlighted, so yea it’s allowed.",74
"Lol, yeah, changing ""tokenomics"" is as simple as updating code.  What are you going to do? Sue?

I mean, *Bitcoin* is the gold standard for ""set in stone"", and devs are currently discussing whether to raise the 21 million token cap to make sure miners get paid enough to keep working after the next halving. 

Ethereum's change from proof of work to proof of stake completely rewrote how Eth works, and I think for the better, because proof of work is outdated and environmentally toxic - but it took years for Buterin to convince users to support the change.

Safemoon (lol) implemented an arbitrary 100% transaction tax that users had to manually opt out of, solely for scam/theft purposes.

It's harder for genuinely decentralized tokens to arbitrarily change how their code works - they have to get consensus support from miners and users or people will just keep using the old code and ignore the changes.  

But the shitcoins you mention?  The devs have centralized control of the blockchain and can do whatever they want, and you can take it or leave it.",74
"True, I thought they perhaps were locked with code,  smart contracts,  etc.   In this case, I'm not as concerned with a burn.   An ability to create new coins would certainly be a concern.  I think I saw one went from deflationary to inflationary but at least coins weren't just given to a random wallet :)",74
" > and devs are currently discussing whether to raise the 21 million token cap to make sure miners get paid enough to keep working after the next halving.

Do you have a citation for this, perhaps a link to a mailing list archive thread? Which developers?",74
"When you're talking about tokens hosted on Ethereum, then it depends on the smart contract behind the token. 

Some contracts are coded in stone, and some of them ('proxy contracts,' I think they're called) basically just say ""use contract <x>"" where <x> can be swapped out by the creator/owner of the proxy contract you're using to interact with the service.",74
"That... Also happens all the time. Biggest example is Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. The project forked with difference in Code, both chains have their supporters and are still around. Whoever had Bitcoin at the time of the fork also got the same number in Bitcoin Cash. 

See also: Doge is a fork of Bitcoin",74
"The idea is called ""tail emissions"" - incentivizing miners by introducing a ""small, ongoing, and predictable issuance of new Bitcoins"" to make up for the ongoing reduction in block rewards.  

It's not exactly a popular idea, but it's not outside the bounds of possibility either.

"Arbitrage happens between exchanges. If price is low on exchange A you buy there, send to exchange B where price is higher and sell there pocketing the difference. 

Doing this will drive prices up on exchange A and selling it on exchange B drives the prices down. Eventually there will not be enough difference in price to profit from arbitrage when you factor in withdrawal & trading fees. 

Eventually prices will decouple enough to enable profitable arbitrage again and the cycle will repeat, this keeps prices pretty close between different exchanges.

If an exchange halts withdrawals there is no means to arbitrage because you cannot transfer between exchanges, and the prices will decouple due to that.",77

Whether that is worth it is something only the future will tell us.  

PS:  The demand for BTC in defi has been replaced most typically with ETH or the networks native coin.  Five years ago, wBTC was what projects wanted to build around but no longer.",78
It's never completely safe. IMO lending out your BTC is not worth it,78
"Personally, I'm more afraid of DeFi lending than traditional financial service providers like Nexo. I've heard about a lot of hacks, and I'm also concerned that I might lose my money due to buggy contracts or so. I feel that the risks of traditional finance are clear to me, but I'm unable to assess the danger in DeFi, which is why I'm more afraid of it. I've been in Bitcoin for a long time, but I can't digest DeFi yet.",78
"Atomic swaps are more technically robust, but lacking

Shapeshift was amazing, but the dev's shut it down due to requiring them to act as a 'transmitter' in the face of US regulations, ie it was centralized. They've been working with THORswap lately, a sort of Shapeshift 2.0 if you will, who has already succeeded in decentralizing all their 'transmitters'..thanks to Cosmo's.

Today, after *this many* years, THORswap is still the only decentralized exchange to buy native BTC on.. And it's in beta. It's absolutely a disgrace, 99%+ BTC (a P2P digital currency) goes through centralized exchanges today. 

If you are fine taking on more risk there is a wBTC bridge on Ethereum, to use BTC-IOUs inside DeFi. Fair warning but there is little demand to borrow unyielding BTC so the APRs are extremely low, relative to eg native ETH lending. Most people supply liquidity in pools (like wBTC/USDC) using their wBTC but this opens you to impermanent losses and isn't strictly lending. Hopefully Thor replaces all this in time, because wBTC is a crappy(risky) Band-Aid and by now it's obvious no one else is even trying.",78
WBTC is safe. The risk comes from where you put that WBTC.,78
"""Can you convince me that it's safe to use for large amounts of money?""

No. If you are a Bitcoiner, you wouldn't think twice about accepting (significant) counterparty risk. If not, you may do so because you are in some way forced to hedge a position; or, in the worst case, you plan to gamble your most valuable collateral for a  leveraged position in shitcoins. Either way: Don't.",78
no its not safe. stay away from defi trash.,78
Not sure about specifically lending BTC but I have been a liquidity provider for pools on a dex called Trader Joe for BTC/AVAX and ETH/AVAX pairs. Been doing it for about a year. Pool APR average over the year has been about 60% and farm APR has been about 20%. Farm APR is paid in an exchange token (JOE) but you can claim and swap if you like. Only downside is impermanent loss which is nearly impossible to avoid unless the price of both pairs move in tandem.,78

I like to remind myself often blockchains are just decentralized open ledgers; full stop. I'm all for a Blackrock putting their business out in the open on a blockchain for all to see rather than the shady private-ledger back door stuff they're doing today. Hence Satoshi's original vision to make BTC.",79
"This is *almost* right IMO.

The one thing it's missing is that this sort of process won't happen on public blockchains, for a *lot* of reasons. To list a few of the most obvious:

* Most people don't want their investments to be public to everyone instantly.
* Making a chain public increases costs of validation, while having it privately administered lets you keep the advantages while also reducing the cost of running it to only slightly more than a normal database, and lets the entity in question respond to issues like hacks and theft.
* Having a private chain also reduces the risk of a 'desync' between the chain and reality, for example someone selling or stealing a physical certificate or other asset without the token moving, or vice-versa.

Basically Blockchains solve the double-spend problem, which makes them useful for asset tracking and traceability, so they may be used in finance and asset management, but it won't be in the way most people on this sub envision it, with everything on Ethereum or some other public blockchain.

In fact it's even likely that a ""CBDC"" won't work like crypto currency, and will just act like low or no cost electronic payments, with no exposure to the underlying technology for the average user.",79
why would financial institutions want to tokenize assets?  it would just make it more difficult for them to engage in fraud.,79
"""They will keep control of the prices and you will just trade a virtual version of what ever you want to invest in using virtual tokenized version of cash like the CBDC. They will own all the real assets and all the real wealth and you will hold a computer version of something that feels like that assets and bet on where the price of that asset goes next.""

Wait... Isn't that what they've been doing for 25 years? Subprimes, HELLOOO!!! Banks already don't own real assets... They sell certificates (but most of the time don't have 100% of the underlying)... They sell options (but most of the time don't hold the underlying) etc... You really think anyone holds enough OIL to cover 100% of the open contacts out there? NO FUCKING WAY ! :D Deutsche Bank, only, has 50T open derivatives... And that's how you end up paying electricity and gas VERY EXPENSIVE... Because some morons are toying with derivatives...

Blockchain only is an easier, faster, cheaper way of dealing with dematerialized assets ;) In a few years, all the bonds, stock market, mortgages etc... will be ""created"" on blockchains and CBDCs will replace fiat... But don't expect it to be public... Will be privately managed... Maybe something similar to SWIFT.

BTC and ETH might survive... But many other cryptoassets might disappear.",79
"blockchain systems are useful for decentralisation and trustlessness properties, not because of hash after hash. if JP Morgan creates its own permissioned blockchain it’s ok - it simply means that it doesn’t need those properties of open systems such as bitcoin or ethereum. other companies may need them",79
"JP Morgan already experimented on ETH. They had an interview on Empire podcast. And they found the tech is not fast enough to handle their volume even on a L2, like Polygon. 

All these ETH folks are coping that RWA trading will mainly happen on ETH. The only reason ppl are still building on ETH is because degen liquidity is there. Big financial institutions don’t give a fuck about crypto’s puny sized degen liquidity. We are all fucking poor to their standards. JP Morgan alone is worth than ETH, with a lot more liquidity. They aren’t going to kowtow to build on ETH just to catch degen interest.

The fact is, they will build on a blockchain giving them maximum profit and network connection. And that means low gas fees. ETH degen money is inconsequential to the outside financial world.",79
"Businesses will adapt and create their own coins, book keeping, tracking and other helpful systems on platforms like ETh, ADA, SOL and others since very few have the resources to create their own. Sooner rather then later an easy to use, dummy proof platform will be made available by Google or Microsoft or what ever giant will do it first and names like Cardano or Ethereum will just be a distant memory of the pioneers of the blockchain tech.",79
"To own a custody of the receipt is to suggest a right of claim and delivery. Tokenized what. The actual asset, in your dreams.. Maybe the paper claims more likely or what ever amount of claims they choose to created out of thin air,  that no one will ever verify as actually backed by anything physical. The difference is I can obtain and hold actual gold, cash or what ever else real asset I wish to own today and that option will not be available in the tokenized future. 

If we learned anything from the big institutions is that they understand that at no point in time the claims on any asset are called for redemption at 100%. So they ALWAYS created fractional shell game and created assets from thin air, to base more securities or financial instruments on for clients to buy. Tokenization will be exactly the same. We are giving institutions a power to just create. Why spend billons of dollars getting the asset out of the ground when you can just tokenize claim on resources as you located them in the earth. The amount used by industry can always be delivered but those that public or retail investors buy can simply just be claims on something no one has access to, just custody. 

The tokenization by definition, saves you from ever needing to hold or access the real thing.",79
Not if they control the pricing of that asset and not if they can tokenize commodities that aren't even out of the ground yet.,79
"Ethereum and others rely a lot on investors and private validators. As a business, companies would always prefer the business solution because they need stability and not gambling and volatility. They have no interest in making ETH or ADA holders rich.",79

About 6 months ago I tried futures trading but after a few months and losing about $100-200 I gave up on this stupid idea. Switched to trading bots on Binance. They were not bad,  I think I even made a few bucks in a few months. Something like $50. Then moved all my funds completely to hardware wallet.

I don’t stake or loan my coins in any way. They are all in my hardware wallet. I run a full Bitcoin archival node just to contribute to the network.

My plans for the future is just hold for 10-20 years and see where it gets me. I don’t invest into crypto big money, I invest only what I am not afraid to lose. $200 a month won’t leave me on the streets if something goes wrong with the crypto.",82

Mistake #1",85
I still use my Ledger and have several backup ledgers. I'm not sure if they ever even released the controversial update.,85
"I have used both Ledger and Trezor. Honestly the events you referenced have caused irreparable damage to the trust/brand for Ledger. For now I still use both. That being said, when the time comes to practice some proper key hygiene, I will be turning to the well audited, open source solution 😉",85
"I've been researching and compiling different wallet info. I will make a comprehensive post about this maybe later today after work.


There is no good decision. The overall best bang for your buck seems to be Trezor 3 (no other Trezor model has a secure element) but I am not a fan of it's usability.

The majority of wallets have one or more shortcoming. Usually not open source, don't show smart contract TX data, or lack of coin support. 

Tangem has security vulnerabilities if you don't generate the seed while Ellipal has wallet address issues. NGRAVE is not open source (but otherwise appears to be the most secure). Safepal is Chinese. Bitbox doesn't state their EAL level.",85
Still using my old Nano.,85
“we”,85
I checked out the options and decided to stay with ledger.,85
"**YES.**  I bailed on Ledger and I'll never go back.  Ledger can't be trusted.  Here's a summary of why, with links.

1: Ledger's word can't be trusted.  The following was a lie:

> Your keys are always stored on your device and never leave it

> SOURCE: [btchip, Ledger Co-Founder, on May 14th, 2023](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13gs0xn/using_ledger_with_3rd_party_wallets/jk34kcn/)

...that's a lie because they added key extraction firmware to users devices.

2: Ledger's code can't be trusted.  It can't be verified:

> There's no backdoor and I obviously can't prove it

> SOURCE: [btchip, Ledger owner & co-founder](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13itm7u/is_there_a_backdoor_yes_or_no/jkbvys7/)

...they can't prove it because their code is closed source.

3: Ledger can't be trusted with your privacy.  Their CEO said so:

> ""If, for you, your privacy is of the utmost importance, please do not use that product, for sure.""

> SOURCE: [Ledger CEO Pascal Gauthier, on video](https://youtu.be/M3VjQUcyZSY?t=2342)

...he said that about one of his own products.  For sure.

4: Ledger's security can't be trusted.  They've been hacked:

> Ledger wallet users face mounting home invasion and other scareware threats as hacker dumps private customer information online.

> SOURCE: [Cointelegraph, December 24th, 2020](https://cointelegraph.com/news/ledger-data-leak-a-simple-mistake-exposed-270k-crypto-wallet-buyers)

...they can't even keep *their* data secure.  Don't trust them with your coins.

5: Ledger's security has been hacked, and yet...

> ""The bombshell here is the explicit confirmation that Ledger themselves hold the master decryption key for all Ledger Recover users.""

> SOURCE: [@sethforprivacy](https://twitter.com/sethforprivacy/status/1671532787294191618)

...what could possibly go wrong, eh?

6: Ledger refuses to answer questions.

They're [deleting questions](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13itm7u/is_there_a_backdoor_yes_or_no/jkbvys7/) in comments on their sub.

They're [shadowbanning](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/144439c/ledger_please_answer_this_question/) the users who ask them.

They're [scrubbing their website](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13z1yew/ledger_updates_academy_articles/) to remove claims they've been making for years.

They're dirty.

Ledger Can't Be Trusted.",85
"The only real concern you should have is using a device without a secure element. 

Ledger might be closed source, but they know well that anything but pure reliability from their devices would end up with their asses in a very bad place. Besides, if you don’t update and sign up for the recovery thing (Which, by the way, you have to PAY for… it’s a subscription) then you are using everything as it was before the offering of this particular ‘service’.

Ledger is still a very useful and reliable hardware wallet.",85
"Somehow I knew a response to that comment would get the most votes lol.  

Kidding aside,  I've been pretty impressed with the discussion.  It seems trezor is a good choice for what I want out of it.   

But there are several others that sound just as secure and may be better for more advanced users. 

 Worth reading, many good points being made.",85
They did. Original nano is not compatible with Recovery and they seem to be pushing it hard with the latest Ledger update.,85
"> everything as it was before the offering of this particular ‘service’.

Not exactly. As it was before, Ledger had everyone believe that the secure element was completely isolated at a hardware level so that nothing could ever access the secret key / seed phrase that it contained. When they started offering this new seed recovery service, it became clear that that was a blatant lie. The service extracts the seed phrase from the secure element, which was supposed to have been physically impossible. It’s not really a secure element at all if a simple software update (or malware) can access your keys.

Even if you don’t sign up for the service from Ledger, your device is still vulnerable to any malicious software that can crack the code. And it *will* be cracked, it’s inevitable, all software has vulnerabilities. That’s why it was supposed to be physically separated and inaccessible by any software. Ledgers are 100% vulnerable to malware once it is eventually written, and it’s inevitable that it will happen someday.",85
"You just casually throw in ""if you don't update"" as if thats easy and obvious. You cant even use the fucking thing if you don't update. Ledger Live doesn't work. You are the proud owner of a brick.",85
"That's the debate I was having, it seems like it would be fine,  but that little unknown risk can drive you crazy!",85
"> Original nano is not compatible with Recovery

Just because the Nano S isn't compatible with Ledger Recover, it doesn't mean none of the key extraction code is part of the Nano S firmware.

That is really important to understand.

We don't know for a fact that none of the key extraction code is part of the firmware for the Nano S.  Ledger's firmware isn't open source, which means there's no way to be sure what's really in it.

People keep assuming the Nano S is safe, but that's all they're doing: Assuming.

Even Ledger admits they can't prove there isn't a backdoor in their code:

> There's no backdoor and I obviously can't prove it

> SOURCE: [btchip, Ledger owner & co-founder](https://np.reddit.com/r/ledgerwallet/comments/13itm7u/is_there_a_backdoor_yes_or_no/jkbvys7/)

...they can't prove it because their code isn't open.

The problem isn't Ledger Recover.  The problem is key extraction code which could give Ledger, their partner companies, or even hackers access to your keys.

Their code isn't open, so there's no way to prove what's in it.  Anyone who says otherwise is making a dangerous assumption.",85

It also serves web content entirely from the chain too so you could build a website on chain to display info.

I am doing the exact same as you, and have the same plan.

Something I did not think about until after setup, which I absolutely should have, was the staking queue. If everyone unstakes all at once, now, there's an over 12-month delay.. lol.

"Just to note that if you swap your ETH for rETH, while you are indeed self-custodying the rETH you are still introducing an additional risk for your actual ETH. 

This is because your actual ETH is not directly with you anymore, it is with the Rocket Pool protocol. And while Rocket Pool is well established and the code is public, technically there could be a bug or deliberate malicious code in the protocol causing it to lose (or steal) the ETH you have provided, and therefore rendering your rETH worthless (and not redeemable for ETH anymore).",88
Yea although they take a significant cut.,88
"You're right that rETH is exposed to smart contract risk. I would say it's very small considering how long the code has been out there and how much attention it has received, but it's there. In addition, rETH can only be exchanged back to ETH via the protocol if there are sufficient funds in the deposit pool. That hasn't been a problem yet, on the contrary the pool is overflowing, but in different circumstances it might become a problem. If that happens you need to wait until more ETH enters the pool over time or sell at a discount at an exchange.

To be clear, I'm not calling rETH bad, I'm a node operator myself, but it's important to know the risks.",88
"being that they’re one of the only exchanges where they can probably actually return your funds if some fuck shit ever does happen, they kinda earned that huge cut right now. once regulations are done, more US exchanges start opening & competing with coinbase, that cut will be made smaller most definitely. although staking awards will also probably be smaller as well.

Is there any platform / app out there (ideally free or very low cost) which will allow me to automate the Buy of a security once a condition is hit?

"All brokers support what is called a limit order. A limit order is an order to buy or sell an instrument when the price of an instrument reaches the desired price. It's not done using a percentage because percentages must be relative to some previous time. I.e 1% from today, yesterday, 1 hour ago, etc. etc. 

Some brokers can support more sophisticated ""conditional order"" types. To place an order based on percentage - some brokers offer a ""conditional contingency"" order type where a value such as percentage change can be used to trigger an order. Brokers like Fidelity, Schwab, Ibkr, etc. support various conditional order types.

There are also brokers like Schwab/TDA, Ibkr, Tasty, etc. that offer APIs so you can code your own conditional order depending on how sophisticated you want to be.",91

I sure as hell would.

"""However, rest of its portfolio is still going strong and it's sitting on plenty of cash""

The stock price is below where it was 20 years ago and the market clearly doesn't have confidence in PFE's capital allocation - nor has PFE given it any reason to. They overpaid for Seagen (https://www.wsj.com/articles/pfizer-overpays-for-seagen-but-whos-counting-695be747), they would have massively overpaid for Allergan years ago if the deal wasn't blocked - and Abbvie bought it a few years later for about half of what PFE was going to pay. 

 There were tons of people on r/stocks for months now pumping PFE ""they have an obesity drug too!"" - now after the obesity drug failed, ""they still have other things."" If PFE's portfolio was strong they wouldn't be overpaying for SGEN and the stock wouldn't have done what it's done over the last 1-5-10-20 years.

Their attempt to launch an offering in what will likely be a very big drug class in the years ahead was lousy and stock has been terrible for both the short and long term. The confidence in a name that has done nothing for ages to earn it is odd.

On this, Lilly’s dual target Zepbound is going to crush every single target in efficacy (already beats semaglutide) and they priced it a bit lower than Wegovy.  And they have a good triple target candidate well into clinical trials.

A while ago Pfizer bought an innovative cancer tech in Sugen and never did much with it other than fire everyone who discovered everything (they started a major science field) and take the single drug.

The efficacy numbers reported in the article even for their twice daily GLP-1 were already bad vs Novo or Lilly, and with significant GI problems?  Obesity is consumer driven and this will get a terrible reputation.",93

"Do you mean a Traditional 401(k)? It really depends on your tax bracket but this sounds like nonsense to me.

Make sure you are contributing enough to capture your employer match, if any.",98
"Depends on your tax bracket, but if you are over the cutoff it may be relatively worth it to at least put all that crossed over to save some taxes

But no there is no magic number.",98
"No, different buckets. You can max both.",99
"401k and IRA are sperate things (vehicles) that do not impact each other in anyway. Trad (pretax) vs Roth (posttax) are just the tax treatments you can select in your vehicle. There are different rules for Trad IRA and Roth IRA but since asking about Roth IRA we will just focus on those rules (there are no rule difference between trad and Roth 401k).

You can have both an IRA and a 401k, your contributions and limits for each type of vehicle do not impact either vehicle in anyway. So never conflate IRA or 401k rules or limits with a each other. They separate and no need to ever think of them in the same sentence.

So to answer your question you can invest in both to the max limit per their rules. 401k can invest up to $22500 in 2023 full stop nothing else to think about (for the normal employee).

For a Roth IRA, you can invest up to 6500 in 2023 unless you make more than 125k if single. If you don't make more than 125k then we are done with concerning about rules or limits. 

Suggest max 401k up to company match, IRA, HSA (investment account allowed if have high deductible health insurance, don't confuse with FSA or other similar accounts), then 401k for retirement priority. There are some nuances not mentioned but for 99 percent of people the above should work for you. Also, since new make sure you invest your amounts in your accounts. You have to buy stock in an IRA and your 401k you choose investments. For now, just pick Target Date funds till you understand more. Pick a target date fund matching your retirement year. If plan to retire in 2060 pick and Target Date fund with 2060 in the name.

Once you understand more you can choose better investments but for newbies I think it is the best approach.",99

[Roth IRA limits for 2024 will be $7,000 under 50 years old, and $8,000 over 50.](https://www.fidelity.com/learning-center/smart-money/roth-ira-contribution-limits)

If you have the money to spare, max them both out every year.",99
They are completely separate limits.,99
This breaks it down perfectly. Thank you very much!,99
"No problem. Just focus on learning the basic rules and don't worry about your investments too much until you understand more as you go. Just read a couple articles over the next year to understand.the differences between IRA, 401k, HSA, 529, and normal brokerage account. 

Once you understand the accounts types then can focus on the rules and then eventually investment strategy. I basically just follow Boglehead approach but once you understand your risk tolerance and strategy can adjust your portfolio accordingly.

"That's not actually how it works. If you sell a CC and it gets exercised, the premium is added to the proceeds of the stock, so it ends up being the same. It can still be a long term gain if the date of exercise (the day the stock actually gets called away) is over a year from original purchase.

If you buy back the option (for a loss) and then sell the stock, I guess maybe you could have a short-term loss which would offset another short-term gain, and replace it with a long term gain from sale of the shares? I'm not sure if that helps you but it might.",100

"If you don't want to be assigned because you think the stock will go higher, your other option (no pun intended) is to roll the call. 

Basically BTO the short call position, and write a new call further in time.

Indeed my thinking around the generating short term loss on the CC is to offset other gains but it can also work for income if you are in a high tax bracket.",100

It doesn't really seem like you addressed the question,100
Sorry for not being more clear. Indeed the question is when the intention to lose the shares.,100
"Actually - it depends on the circumstances of when you wrote the call, I realize.

When did you write it, and was it ITM at that time? When would it normally expire?",100
How did it not? The op asked if it’s always better to buy back. And the answer depends if he wants the shares or not,100

Doing so would contribute the opposite of their goal of maximizing employment when inflation is not an issue. I.e. we can easily start seeing cuts by March.,102

PCE is a better measure because it captures consumer behavior changes as a result of innovation or changes in the market. E.g CPI might weigh price of horses if you are calculating it for year 1900 vs today and not include price of cars. PCE would look at price of cars but might not weigh price of horses.

That doesnt count towards IRR, so you can get situations where a fund distributes money and has very little in terms of contributions. That blows up returns to make them much higher on the surface than they really are. There’s a lot of tactics like that.",111

"There needs to be a really good reason other than ""because it's simpler"" to file separately when married.  The benefits of filing jointly are just too great.  You can still keep your earned and spent money separated, but don't hurt yourself on the tax end.

If you file separately and live together, there is a $10,000 income limit for contributing to a Roth IRA, effectively making it a non-option.  That right there is a reason to file jointly.

IRAs and 401(k)s are always individual accounts, by the way.  So those are separate no matter what.

You can contribute the full amount to Roth IRA directly if you earn less than $230,000 as a couple in 2024.  If you make more, you can contribute via a technique called a ""back door"" contribution, which uses a traditional IRA as the loophole to get the money in.  I'm not going to explain how to do this here; it's a very common topic so you should Google it.

529's are a good option for saving for college expenses. 

If you have access to a mega backdoor Roth then I don't think there's a reason to open a regular Roth. You might be eligible if your income is low enough but whatever money you could put into a Roth, you can already do through the Mega backdoor route.

FSA for daycare can be a slight savings on taxes. It comes out of pretax. We had $4500 for daycare that i saved paying taxes on. Both patents must work or one be full-time in school. The bad part is it was reimbursed throughout the year (so I could only get back $175 per paycheck)",114

Also in what alternative dimension do they have a strong pipeline? They literally JUST got hammered for yet another big drug trial failure.

I remember looking at Einhorn's presentation on Bayer some years ago.

I’m pulling the rest of this post out of my ass, but Monsanto and the Danforth center are my backyard. 

They lost in a Missouri court, Monsanto is a St. Louis company, they couldn’t have asked for a more favorable environment for that trial. They’re going to continue to get rolled over in court. 

However, and this is completely speculative, I wonder what the value of just Monsanto will be in the coming years given the shifts agriculture that are going to be needed to feed 10 billion people on  dwindling traditional productivity. We’re about to find ourselves in a Malthusian trap unless something gives, and the plant science division at Monsanto would be a likely place for the solution to originate. Additionally an activist investor may soon be able to come in and buy Bayer outright and fire management. 

It’s definitely a giant gamble, but there’s for sure a potential upside at the right price. It’s on my watch list but the price needs to crater some more for me to feel like there’s an acceptable margin of safety.",115

Bayer made a number of considerable errors and recent discussions of ideas how to improve shareholder value don't seem that promising, noting that spin offs wouldn't solve the core issues.  It could make for a decent turnaround story over years, but they have to get someone of the magnitude of Larry Culp, who should be in the CEO hall of fame for his post-Immelt revamp of GE. Until then, this is exactly the kind of thing that people talk about being a great value down 30% and then it goes down another 30% in a hurry and people go, ""now it's a value!"" as the stock then slides further. Too many people focused on trying to pick bottoms in mediocre companies with issues rather than focusing on high quality ones that are well-managed and working well.",115

">what happens if there is a change in portfolio allocation? Do I get updated and have to make the changes manually?

It depends on the product. In a single sleeve SMA which is model based, the models are updated by the external manager. But the rebalancing is usually managed by RIA. But firms may outsource to a TAMP (turnkey asset management platform) who handle rebalancing. It kinda depends.  

In a multi-sleeve product - there may be multiple asset managers and it would depend on the platform that the RIA or sponsor system that is being used. 

 It really depends on the job and whether you are in a front-office or middle-office role.

As a professional at any large firm these are mostly automated and rebalanced.  Every client can be addressed individually or in a cookie cutter method.,119
">My first question is, do firms (like Blackrock) that provide model portfolios provide asset allocation and the basket of securities that go into the portfolio, and I as the FP would have to buy those securities for my client? or would I give them the funds and they would manage it on my behalf.

It can be either. The former is usually referred to as UMA (at least internally by the asset manager) The asset manager provides the allocations and ongoing trade instructions, You (the RIA) executes the trades themselves in their client portfolios. The latter is usually known as a single or dual contract SMA and you give the money to the asset manager which manages the portfolio for you, you just provide statements to your client.",119
"On the asset manager side, we would refer to the different funds/products as mandates. Not 100% sure of the context but could just mean you get access to different managers (say, Fidelity) and different mandates (say, their US Total Growth Fund of their Global Yield Fund).",119

What if it is in a normal account? Not tax advantaged.,124
"These types of Trusts wouldn't be available.

&#x200B;

But in the US, it is the act of the distribution that you get taxed on, no matter what you have it do (reinvest or take as cash) and funds are required to pay out dividends at least annually (see note below). For some countries outside the US (Europe especially), may have a choice on an accumulating fund (dividends reinvest internally) vs distributing (you get the dividends as cash), and different countries may tax these differently.

&#x200B;

Trusts as mentioned above are allowed in 401K and similar plans to not distribute annually because they're restricted to tax advantaged accounts.",124

"An investment calculator is not optimistic or pessimistic, it just does basic math. The S&P500 has returned over 10% annually on average and accounting for inflation, not nowadays inflation but normal average inflation, that's about 8% a year. So yes whatever you put in is what has historically happened, with no guarantees that will continue but that's investing 🤷🏻‍♂️",125
"First.  No one can predict the future.

Second.  FXAIX has been around for 12 years and over that history it went from $47.50 to $158.45 which is an annualized return of about 10.6%.  See the graph of FXAIX [here](https://www.google.com/finance/quote/FXAIX:MUTF?window=MAX).

Third.  I ran your numbers and, assuming FXAIX performs as well going forward, it appears the investment calculator you used is underestimating where you will be.  My estimate shows you should have $2.8 million in your 401K in about 17 years.

You can check my calculations [here](https://smartasset.com/investing/investment-calculator#GwFEnaLf8M).

I would say the estimate you got is sort of middle of the road and might be a pretty good number to use for planning purposes.  You could always be a little safer and use a nice round $2 million amount for your planning purposes if you want to be more conservative which is probably a good idea.  Better to have more than expected at retirement than less.",125
"That does not count inflation. With 5.5% real return, you'd have $1.6M in today's dollars.",125
"I think 7% is the real (after inflation) average annual return, so I would use that number. But, yeah, statistically investing for ˜20 years will pay off if you let time do the heavy lifting.",125
"the problem with investment calculators is they assume the market goes up, without fail, at a predicable or guaranteed annual rate. 

in reality, that does not happen. the website Real Investment Advice did an article recentlyabout how market returns are very uneven, with long periods of nothing and small clusters of fantastic returns: https://realinvestmentadvice.com/compound-market-returns-are-a-myth/

for example, the S&P 500 (FXAIX) was nearly flat from 2000-2011, with cumulative returns slightly over 10%, and thus average annual returns under 1%/year. not 8%. chart here, using VIIIX: https://imgur.com/a/yZjkS1r

adjust for inflation and you would have lost money in the S&P 500 from about 1968-1994. https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-data

so when you run those investment calculators, interpret the numbers with caution because they don't adjust for major crashes or 'lost decades'. IMO cut the results by about 50% and assume your returns will likely, but not definitely, be somewhere between $1.1 and $2.3 million.",125
infinite growth is unsustainable,125
Retire earlier than 65.  Why wait - enjoy your life while you’re still able to.,125
"investment calculators do math *as if you were going to get guaranteed returns in the market year after year*. 

which never happens. in reality, the returns are unevenly distributed. sometimes extremely so. the US market was nearly flat from 1968-1982 and 2000-2012.",125
"Increasing pay over time would lead to increasing contribution amounts. If your pay increases in line with inflation, would these cancel each other out?",125
Yes this was what I would go with. You should double your portfolio about every 10 years.,125
"OPs portfolio is likely to be between $1.1M and say $3.4M, Monte Carlo trials result in a grouping of end values around a median value - his portfolio is just as likely to be above $2.3M as it is below $2.3M. Arbitrarily cutting the result by 50% might feel nice but I'm arguing it's unrealistically conservative.",125
"Those “the market was flat for X years” callouts are biased in their own way, too.

Yes, if you dumped all of your money into the S&P 500 in one lump sum in 2000, you’d have earned basically nothing as of 2011. But how often does someone dump their entire savings into the market at once and then buy nothing for over a decade? If - in a more realistic scenario - you had been DCA’ing into it the entire time, you’d have considerable returns over the same time period.",125
"I mean, it's exactly what has happened given time. Sure, that's not gonna be accurate for the next 2 years from now, or 5. But in the long run it's what everyone here is sure counting on lol.",125
"The 50th percentile ending portfolio value using a Monte Carlo simulator often ends up larger than using straight-line returns, so the lack of guaranteed returns doesn't necessarily reduce the optimistic assumption. 

To the OP, the calculator assumes whatever annual contributions you tell it until your retirement year, with investment growth, in future dollars. The future value can look optimistically large but you have to remember inflation will have eaten into the portfolio's purchasing power at that time.

"The market is priced with a discount rate of about 10% on DCFs. So unless there is a big impact on future earnings (and remember we went through 2 world wars, cold wars and more with not too much long term impact on stocks), the 10% returns should continue",125
"Man people are jerk.

Quick answer for you. 

Buy $100 of stock. 

Stock goes up 7% that year you now own $107 worth of stock.

Next year it goes up 7% again. That’s 7% of $107 so the value is now $114.49. The second year the value increased 7.49% of your original buy.",126
"The compounding is built in. Here’s one way to visualize it hypothetically.

2010 - You buy 1 share of VTI for 50.

2011 - VTI gains 10% from 2010 to 2011 and now is $55/share.

2012 - VTI gains 10% from 2011 to 2012 and is now $60.5/share.

2013 - VTI gains 10% from 2012 to 2013 and is now $66.55/share.

Do you see it?  Your original $50 grew in the first year by $5 but in the second year it grew by $5.50.  That’s the compounding.  In the third year your $50 grew by $6.55.

Regardless of how high the price of VTI gets you still only have a basis of $50 in VTI and that original $50 grows progressively faster as the price of VTI increases.",126
Your VTI interest comes in the form of extra shares. It accumulates while you hold VTI.,126
"So based on how I'm interpreting your question, the answer is yes. Ignoring dividends, for stocks, it's not really compound interest because you're not getting paid interest. The value of the company (or etf) is going up. The way you'd still take advantage of this however is stocks move at a percentage. So the 30 year average of ~7% gain just keeps getting bigger and you'll have gains on your gains, compounding. Hopefully i explained that well enough.",126
"Absolutely! If you never sold the VTI and kept the dividends in the account, your money would benefit from compounding Depending on the time frame, you could see an increase in your funds! Keeping dividends in your account and reinvesting them is key to taking advantage of compounding intrest The longer you leave it in the account, the faster itll compound! It could make quite the difference in the amont of money you have in the long run! Spell check no w",126
[removed],126
"Yeah I think the concept is often misunderstood by most people. 

Dividend stocks it makes clear sense because you recieve dividends and can reinvest then to increase the number of shares.

Index funds typically give some dividends so guaranteed compounding.

Blue chip Growth stocks don't pay dividends but reinvest in the company so the price should move at a more parabolic rate over time. The compounding is in the price action.

Unprofitable or underperforming stocks that don't pay dividends... I dont believe actually give compound interest. 

7% per year with no dividends is just a fancy way of saying it takes 10 years for a 100% gain. 

If you only buy once and hold a stock that isn't paying dividends or making massive profits and reinvesting it in the company, I don't think you actually are getting compounded growth. 

I'm happy to hear others opinion on this but I don't think every investment that doesn't lose money can be considered compounding",126
Thanks bro! I was thinking too deep about it lol. I obviously understood that your money will grow but couldn't visualize the compounding without realizing the gains. Thanks for the help,126
Definitely makes sense. I wasn't thinking of the growth as compounding and was having trouble visualizing how it would work in comparison with something like dividend compounding where you are directly investing the gains rather than leaving them untouched. Thanks for the help!,126
Thank you. I wasn't thinking that you got extra shares but rather an increase on the shares that you do own. So I was thinking of that as growth and had it separated from compounding in my head. Appreciate the help,126
Yah this is a common question and the difficulty is from people applying the idea of compound interest to a situation with compounding value. Similar but not quite.,126
"No worries. Glad you’re asking the right questions. 

For nicer answers maybe try r/nostupidqiestions",126
Do you reinvest your dividends or take them as cash in your account? Set them to reinvest. There is usually a check box,126

"The stock market isn’t the economy. 

But it’s a good measure of the market.

I have never heard of a DJIA fund. That would only be 30 stocks and probably doesn’t meet the diversification criteria a mutual fund requires.

"I think you mean the DJIA is not a good measure of the equity markets (not the economy)

The DJIA is a dumb index that should die, its a price weighted index that doesn't make sense.

Its around because

1. Its old, its really easy just to add up the stock price of 30 companies so 120 years ago you could do this quickly with out a calculator or spread sheet
2. The numbers are big, it makes better headlines to say ""The dow dropped 1700 points!!"" VS the the S&P500 dropped 3%

I also hate when the news reports in points . Saying the dow dropped 1000 points means nothing alone because I do not memories what the dow was at (or the S&P500)

If the DOW is at 10,000 and dropped 1000 points well that's a HUGE drop 10% in a single day that is a blood bath

If the dow is at 50,000 well that a 2% drop, a larger drop then normal but nothing major",127

Sure. The Dow isn't a good measure of the economy.  Neither is the NASDAQ.,127

"It might be worth it to plug some numbers into a retirement calculator. 

&#x200B;

For taxes; if you're going to be living off of the income supplied by your IRA and nothing else, you're likely to be in a low tax bracket unless you have a massive retirement built up. In that case I'd stick with a traditional IRA. Keep in mind that you have the ability to convert to a Roth (unless congress takes it away at some point) in the future, so if things change you can adapt.

&#x200B;

As for the investments, you have a long time horizon. Target date funds are fine but are generally more conservative, you might consider a broad market fund instead. Max out the contribution that your company will match to take advantage of the ""free"" money.",128
"You almost always want a mix of both styles for the most tax flexibility in retirement. You can do a Roth IRA and a traditional 401k or the opposite.

Yes, target date, and sure set it to when you will turn 60.

Also the idea of being “way behind the curve” at 25+ is hilarious. Folks don’t graduate from college until 22ish, and most jobs right out of college aren’t paying enough to make significant retirement contributions. You’re fine. Just breathe. It’s exciting now but there’s a *lot* of really boring years.",128
"I haven’t actually done the calculations yet, but I’m pretty sure if you invest the money you save on your taxes from a traditional, it’s better to do a traditional now and a Roth closer to retirement.   (As a general rule) 

But that’s assuming you’re investing the saved taxes, otherwise nah",128
Roth IRA then switch to traditional in a couple decades,128
"I would do a Roth 401k at your tax bracket 

A shout out to the money guy show podcast/youtube channel they recommend Roth for people paying less than 25-30% rate(federal +state) 

Basically your taxes are the lowest the should be in your career so tax free growth will likely be better. You can take the tax break if you ever start really getting taxed.

For what it’s worth your company match will be 100% in a traditional account regardless (you will pay taxes on the withdrawals from that portion of money) of how you do your contributions . Invest up to the full match then contribute to a Roth IRA outside of work if you can save more than that.",128

Thank you, that’s a bit reassuring, not being behind the curve.",128
I just graduated and started working full-time a few months ago. I feel like I'm already trapped in the boring years. I miss college... *sigh*,128
What’s the benefit of doing that? No tax now but pay tax for a shorter time before retiring?,128
This was super helpful. Thank you.,128
"Simultaneously. Especially as your income grows, you will want a mix of both in the same year. Traditional contributions lower your tax burden *in that year* let’s say in 2023 you’re making $190k a year (aspirational, but follow me), then if you could save 8k in a traditional account, you’d save paying 32% in taxes on that 8k, and bump you down a tax bracket. Then any amount of Roth you contributed would only be taxed at 24%. Then in retirement, you could use your traditional savings to fill up your low tax brackets, and potentially pay 0 taxes on that 8k — eg if it’s your “first” 8k and the standard deduction is 13.5k.

Imagine drawing from buckets today from the top and filling up later buckets from the bottom.",128
"There’s advantages and disadvantes to both and they both are trying to accomplish the same thing so its a bit of preference, but also if you play it right you could benefit from both. A traditional IRA is where money goes untaxed from your pay into an account. The benefits would be you get the tax deduction so your taxable income is lower, which is good. When you withdraw it years down the road, though, itll be taxed at whatever tax bracket youre in at the time. This is the disadvantage because in theory, in 20 years we’ll be in higher tax brackets meaning you get a smaller tax deduction now, but the tax on the withdrawal will be greater down the road. A roth is the exact opposite. It gets taxed right away and then put into the account, so less money goes in on the front end because some is taken out for taxes, which is the disadvantage. However, when you withdraw, it is 100% tax free which is a huge advantage because like i said, the tax bracket you are currently in now is lower than it will be in 30 years, so you get taxed at a low rate now, then when you take it out, you avoid what would be a hefty amount of taxes.. i personally have my 401k set up as a roth for this exact reason. Not to get too technical, but if you play it perfectly, you can set up the roth now so that your money is being taxed at the current rate (which for all of us is hopefully the lowest we’ll ever be taxed, that assumes we keep making more money) and then whenever i switch into a new tax bracket, ill transfer it all into a traditional IRA so that ill then be getting the bigger deduction. That last part may be confusing, but youre able to switch plans so if you do it right and switch over to traditional at a good time, you can get the advantages of both",128

Go for Mastercard with these valuations. FICO and SPGI are awesome companies but I feel like they are on the higher end of valuation. Mastercard is selling at historically low metrics. I expect to make a consistent 15% a year from MasterCard but you never know,129

Visa/Mastercard are great, I hold both

"My favorite advice from Charlie Munger wasn't about investing per se:

> ""Generally speaking, there are two things I've found in my long life which you never do. One is, never feel sorry for yourself. If your child is dying of cancer, don't feel sorry for yourself. NEVER, ever, feel sorry for yourself. And the other thing you never want to have, is envy. That's the only one of the deadly sins you're never going to have any fun at at all. Pick one of the others.""

~Charlie Munger

My favorite investing advice of his was really simple: ""Just hold the damn stock.""",130
"No investor could convey more wisdom in fewer words than Charlie Munger. 

Charlie was never afraid to speak his mind and provided a wonderful role model for any investor. 

“Life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows. It doesn’t matter. And some people recover and others don’t. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every missed chance in life was an opportunity to behave well. Every missed chance in life was an opportunity to learn something and that your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity. But instead to utilize the terrible blow in constructive fashion. That is a very good idea.” — Charlie Munger

“Three rules for a career: 1) Don’t sell anything you wouldn’t buy yourself; 2) Don’t work for anyone you don’t respect and admire; and 3) Work only with people you enjoy.”

“You don’t have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long time.” — Charlie Munger

“Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward. What happens if all our plans go wrong? Where don’t we want to go, and how do you get there? Instead of looking for success, make a list of how to fail instead. Tell me where I’m going to die, that is, so I don’t go there.” — Charlie Munger

In 1949, Charlie Munger was 25 years old. He was hired at the law firm of Wright & Garrett for $3,300 per year, or $29,851 in inflation-adjusted dollars as of 2010 ($42,000 in 2023). He had $1,500 in savings, equal to $13,570 now.

A few years later, in 1953, Charlie was 29 years old when he and his wife divorced.  He had been married since he was 21.  Charlie lost everything in the divorce, his wife keeping the family home in South Pasadena.  Munger moved into “dreadful” conditions at the University Club and drove a terrible yellow Pontiac, which his children said had a horrible paint job.  According to the biography written by Janet Lowe, Molly Munger asked her father, “Daddy, this car is just awful, a mess.  Why do you drive it?”  The broke Munger replied: “To discourage gold diggers.”

Shortly after the divorce, Charlie learned that his son, Teddy, had leukemia.  In those days, there was no health insurance, you just paid everything out of pocket and the death rate was near 100% since there was nothing doctors could do.  Rick Guerin, Charlie’s friend, said Munger would go into the hospital, hold his young son, and then walk the streets of Pasadena crying.

One year after the diagnosis, in 1955, Teddy Munger died.  Charlie was 31 years old, divorced, broke, and burying his 9 year old son.  Later in life, he faced a horrific operation that left him blind in one eye with pain so terrible that he eventually had his eye removed.",130

Does that mean although my principle contribution was $7500, my available balance to withdraw is only $6756.75? This account is supposed to be a way to open a Savings Account, so that a disabled person can save money without affecting their means-tested benefits. You can make withdraws and order a debit card, etc., like a normal bank account. But is this investment plan style Savings Program costing me $650 dollars per year?",132

Some brokerages like ibkr and perhaps M1 are much more generous with a low margin rate where you don’t have to use short boxes.

It's possible to pool funds into an entity to trade. Many small funds who do not want to be '40 Act fund are simply structured as LLPs or LLCs.

One simple mechanism without creating an LLC or LLP is to use a non-professional advisor account. There are brokers that cater to non-professional advisor accounts. But from your description - it doesn't sound like that will work because of the strategy being used.

While you can trade from a single master account - I do not know if the sub-accounts pool all the funds if you are not using a model that needs to be replicated.

From what you described - the simplest structure could be an investment club.

As long as no one is getting paid and assets are below the registration threshold with limited participants - you can create an investment club account with pooled funds.

There  are brokers that will help with tools to track taxes, etc. An investment club is usually structured as an LLC if you want to pool funds. From a tax perspective - I believe that a K-1 is issued - but you have to check with a tax accountant on the best treatment for investment club members.",135

Yes this often goes unsaid but the tax rate varies from person to person so the bottom line benefit is different. The $3000 is consistent though so that what people use when discussing.,136
"The **first** reason people recommend bonds is simple, Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT).  I won get into the nitty gritty of it but you can read more about it at [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_portfolio_theory) if you like.

The idea is bonds offer you a pool of investable money when the markets have down cycles.  MPT teaches that you should rebalance your portfolio at certain intervals, once a year or twice a year or once every quarter.  Two things happen when you rebalance depending on the state of the markets.

* Up cycle - you sell off some of your winning stocks and buy more bonds
* Down cycle - you sell off some of your bonds and buy cheap stocks

The nice thing about MPT is that it takes the emotion out of buying and selling and causes you to take profits when stocks are up and then buy stocks when stocks are down.  In other words it essentially forces you to “buy low, sell high”.

The theory is great, the reality is utter crap partly because it didn’t take into account ZIRP and the interest rate risks bonds have.  So you had a bunch of brainwashed indoctrinated script monkeys with CFP designations telling everyone to MPT their investments.  Well everyone who had bonds during this last cycle got beat up as they invariable bought bond funds and as interest rates rose those bond funds lost tons of money.

Those who didn’t buy bond funds felt good until they realized they own a bond that pays almost no interest but hey look at the bright side, I can always hold my 10 year bond for another 9 years while earning no interest and I won’t even lose money when it matures.  Yeah that’s just terrific.  Nobody should’ve been buying bonds while interest rates were 0% unless they were I-Bonds.

Suffice it to say today, bonds can be a reasonable part of your portfolio because it doesn’t appear interest rates will go so much higher that your bonds will lose too much value.  In addition of course, bonds are earning a reasonable amount of interest once again.  If you buy bonds, never forget how dangerous interest rate risk is to the asset, if you don’t understand interest rate risk then find someone who does that can manage your bonds for you.

The **second** reason people recommend bonds is to help stabilize a portfolio as the investor nears retirement.  If you are 64 and plan to retire at 65 and you have a portfolio of 100% stocks and the year is 2000 then you are feeling great about retirement right up until December when the market has crashed and your portfolio is worth 50% of what it was in January.

You were COUNTING on that money to retire.  Well guess what, the Nasdaq doesn’t return to it’s all time high again until 15 years later when you are now dead.  Well that sucked.  You thought you were going to enjoy fabulous golf vacations but you ended up eating PBJ and working as a greeter at Walmart to make ends meet.

With bonds and MPT that didn’t happen because 50% to 80% of your portfolio had been shifted to bonds as the market was rising as you were nearing retirement.  The MPT portfolio you have has a nice steady stream of safe income and you ride off into the golf vacation sunset and even live 5 years longer because you weren’t constantly stressed out over money problems.

Moral of the story.  Don’t use MPT.  Do use MPT once you are 10 years from retirement.  Yes I did contradict myself there.  Don’t ever invest in bonds not named I-Bonds (probably STRIPS also) when interest rates are near 0%.  Don’t invest in bonds when inflation is a threat because inflation portends interest rate hikes and interest rate hikes are bond killers.

Anyway, sorry for the length and that is my take.",137
"Have you experienced a 50% drawdown in your portfolio? Bonds make it easier to survive a deep market decline. Something that is harder to do in real-time than it might seem in hindsight. 

It's easy to look at historical charts of the 2000 and 2008 bear markets now that the right end of the chart is well above those lows. It's very different in real life when you're 35% down and still declining, businesses going bankrupt and people you know being laid off. 

In 2008, people who just couldn't tolerate the painful drawdown, or worse, lost their job and had to sell assets to pay their bills, lost far more money than they would have given up by accepting a lower expected rate of return from holding some bonds.

Also, historically the realized returns on stocks is a strong function of their valuation (P/E, P/S etc) and bond returns are a strong function of their starting yield. Based on current valuation and yields, bond expected returns are higher than stock expected returns.",137

"There is no such things as a free lunch in investment.  If you want safety, you have to sacrifice higher reward.  If you want higher reward, you have to sacrifice safety.

If everyone thinks bonds are useless, then bonds would not ""have a lower rate of return"".  If everyone thinks like redditors, all bond yield will be higher than 10%.

The answer to the question comes down to risk tolerance.  I have gone through the 2008 financial crisis and the 2009 crash where my portfofio was reduced by half.  But a lot of posters here are either too young or weren't investing at that time.",137
They don't return less all the time. It's a diversification tool,137
"1. For smoother ride and better sleep at night.
2. It allows you to take advantage of the volatile nature of the stock market by letting you use the bond portion to ""buy the dip"" when big corrections/crashes are coming. If the money is diversified well, meaning it is providing decent returns while waiting for volatile opportunities that one can expect dozen of times in their lifetime, it can be as efficient as 100% stock portfolio or more, with better sleep at night.

I personally do so with limited-pay dividend-paying life insurance from top mutual insurers, not treasuries that people typically do. It practically functions as a tax-free corporate bond with the liquidity of online bank accounts through practical wash loans.",137
bonds add diversification and increase your risk adjusted returns over time.,137

"Thanks for the reply. I appreciate your taking the time to answer in such detail (with a reference!) The only bonds I have are Ibonds and that's a very tiny part of the whole. Other than rebalancing once a year, I don't really plan on doing anything other than putting money at a regular interval across the various accounts available between my wife and I. I figure as long as I keep the stock distribution diversified across industries, I'll be fine, but I also worry that I'm missing some key pieces that I might not understand that'll come and bite me in the butt.",137

Great advice,138
What about 457k?  Or just do index funds?,138
Do a bit of both? Do 457 if there is a match and try to max out Roth.,138
"It looks like a 457k is a ""tax-differed"" plan, that would be similar to a traditional IRA. Basically the money put in is reduced from your marginal earners. So if you make top income brackets (maybe due to other income sources as well), then traditional is the way. If you are lower or mid income bracket, then don't use it and focus on Roth. 

Of course, if there is any matching, fully fund to the match because that is free money. 

in each account (457k or Roth, etc) you can pick an index fund, target date fund, etc. I personally like target date funds for such accounts. 

(single filing)

Looking into 2024 tax brackets. I would say if you make less than 47k a year, Roth for sure. If you make between 47 and 191k, it doesn't really matter too much. If you make over 191k, then traditional Roth.

Roth up until 201k, Traditional for over 383k.",138

"Personally, I would start building a 10 year bond ladder using Treasuries, TIPS or defined maturity bond ETFs.  Hold each rung to maturity.",139

"If you would like to get a little higher return then just a treasury ladder, I would recommend looking at iShares High yield corporate bond etf $HYG.  For a bit safer fund with less interest rate risk, Blackrock's $VCSH (short term corporate bonds) is a good choice too.

If you don't mind shouldering a little extra risk, JP morgan's covered call ETF for the SP500 $JEPI, and their covered call ETF for the NASDAQ $JEPQ are both good choices.  Both used covered call strategies to provide income to their shareholders and reduce volatility in their returns, but at the cost of a reduced return when compared to an index fund.  I have invested in $JEPI for a bit and have been happy with the monthly income.",139
"government bond, municipal bond, corporate investiment grade bond, corporate mid grade bond/HY bond, corporate junk bond, foreign government bond, foreign corporate bond.  

You should just look into performance of each fund among its peers.  There is no other more objective indicator of what you should buy.

If you are 10 years out, I recommend considering buying individual bonds rather than mutual funds or ETFS.  You should have bought 10 year US treasury and locked in at 4.5%.  The 10 year yield is dropping like a rock because there is a huge panic buy when the yield is at historic high.  But now it is at 4.2% and dropping.

The advantage of individual bond is that you are completely not affected by market fluctuations.  If you can buy bonds that mature in 10 years, what you get back is exactly the issue price.  Junk bond is the only exception.  Nobody buys individual junk bonds.",139

"Yes. Why? Better expected returns for marginally higher risk.

Factor premia may shrink but should not disappear entirely. If investors were taking on more risk buying smaller or lower-valued companies for the same returns as larger, higher-valued companies, that would not be inefficient, it would be irrational. It is a matter of when, not if, the premium delivers.",142
"Yes, I use avuv. Small cap value has evidence for growing well",142
"*Do the small cap and value premiums still exist*

I have no idea how prominent the small cap/value premiums exist - but I feel they have to exist to some extent. I don't remember who exactly I read that said this, but if an investor was guaranteed identical returns between, say, Google and Matson, Inc (a small cap shipping company in Hawaii), they will likely invest in Google just because it's more interesting. Hence, there has to be some premium for small cap/value companies just because they're more boring than large cap/growth companies.

I think the premium is likely smaller than it used to be. Much of the outperformance of small cap value was in the 70s or earlier - when stock market information was hard to find, and market transactions were relatively infrequent. Small cap value stocks would have been hard to discover and hard to invest in - and hence, demand a legitimate premium. Those conditions are no longer the case.

*Do you allocate to small cap value?*

Yes. As before, I figure there's some premium. It's also the cheapest/easiest way to decorrelate a portfolio from the broader stock market - even if the decorrelation isn't particularly strong. Further, my job/income is strongly influenced by the success of the large cap growth companies at the extreme upper right corner of the Morningstar style box, so I figure investing in the extreme lower left corner is a good way of hedging risk to my income.",142

"So personally I do not, but I would consider a small cap value + profitability tilt.

In general, I don't think there is a stand along small cap factor premium, but interactions between factors (small + value, small + profitability) are strong.

So yeah, go for it, but just know it's going to involve more vol than large caps.",142
"There is a guiding rule of thumb on how to consider small cap value stocks for now. If you think the markets aren't TOTALLY efficient and you believe in the premium then now is one of the worst times to bail out on small cap value. They're currently underperforming very painfully against growth stocks. If they're due for underperformance and we see reversion to the mean then to bail out now means bailing out on that upwards ride.

You need to evaluate your worst case and best case outcomes here and expose yourself accordingly. There's a reason why index funds are favored, and it's because it ensures you do not severely underperform the market. Smallcap value could make a comeback and beat market returns, or they can continue underperformance for 10 years...15 years...19 years...or forever.

I am deeply invested in smallcap value and working towards making 50% of my portfolio smallcap value. However, know this. I invested enough into the normal boring old 2-fund broad index portfolio to have a roughly estimated balance of $1.5 mil when all is said and done over the next 2.5 to 3 decades. Earlier than that if I continue to be fortunate and healthy. I don't say this to boast, I'm saying it to showcase my perceived ""worst/average"" scenario.

The $3K capital loss will lower your taxable income by $3K ie your taxable income is now $57K.,143
Remember that losses can be netted against gains.,143
"If you want to sell to harvest the loss for tax purposes, sometimes, with mutual funds or ETF's you can sell and buy something with the money, very similar immediately,  to maintain your position.

Obviously for individual equities or bonds, this does not work as easily.

If you have more than $3000 in capital losses, you can carry the leftover forward to future years until it is used up.",143
Yes,143

[removed],143
"Taking OPs question a step further, I use H&R Block tax software, and it allows me import my merrill brokerage transactions for the tax year. Is it automatically reducing my taxable income by my capital losses when it does this?",143
"It’s not advisable to realize $3k in losses purposefully per year as OP infers in his posts. It’s beneficial if it’s a loss you’re going to have to take at some point anyway (tax loss harvest).

Tax liability delta between $60k and $57k federally is $660. So you get $660 credit for a $3k loss. Not an ideal trade.

OP also mentions realizing it $3k per year. You can realize all your losses but only $3k per year will apply but the rest will carry over. The carry over amount can be applied to the next year and if you ever make money the carry over in its entirety will be applied to the profit. For instance if OP realizes $6500 in losses. $3000 would be deducted from income in 2023 and if OP nets $10k profit in 2024, the $3500 that was leftover would be deducted from the $10k. Leaving OP with *only* $6500 in taxable profits.",143
That's is the key and there is no annual limit to this use of realized capital losses.,143
"idk how the software does it (likely deducting it), but whatever final paper it gives you, look for Form 1040 and check line 7 to see if it's deducting 3k there.

For more detailed capital gains/loss, you'd need to look at schedule D paper.

Btw, another note, if you have/had a wash sale (sell and then rebuy a stock within 30 days timeframe) towards December, make sure you modify the Schedule D to declare it a wash sale. I don't think Turbo Tax does it for you, and likely same for H&R. 

Also, from my limited experience of importing data from Merill Edge with Turbo Tax, sometimes there're errors so you might want to double check those data as well.",143

"Hi everyone,

I’m 27 years old with a growing family and a mortgage, and I’ve recently started considering the world of investing. Up until now, I’ve never really delved into it.

">You’re right about there traditionally being a correction around this time. The thing that leads me to believe that there may not be this time is the Bitcoin Spot ETF which is seemingly imminent.

Yeah I think this is interesting. Bitcoin has generally been subject to negative news in the media almost constantly since inception (I've lost count of the amount of times it's been ""banned""). It's a constant, mild negative pressure on the price. 

Bitcoin has been accused of almost every evil I can think of, it's never broken the 4-year halving cycle pattern. If you scroll out, the price seems to be following a logarithmic growth curve (rising steeply at first, and slowly settling to a stable long term value). 

&#x200B;

But endorsement from the world's largest financial firms and the potential inflows of huge amounts of institutional, retail and pension money would be a truly major, sustained, positive story. 

This is the first thing I think *could* break the 4-year cycle - in an upwards direction. 

At present we're due for the next halving rally in late 2024. I wonder if ETF approval would either 1) bring the rally forward to Q1 2024 or even 2) break the logarithmic curve entirely and move us onto the steep part of an S-shaped technology adoption curve.

Clients at my firm do this occasionally by accident, with no repercussions.",159
"I think he's talking short-term vs long-term trading/holding. OP misused  ""shorting"" in the title.",159
"My understanding is you can short the box, you just cant use it to avoid taxes. For example, a trader may short the box if they are planning to short a low float stock which may be difficult to locate shares to short for. They would initiate a short position once shares become available and initiate a long position at the same time. Once their desired entry point is reached for their short trade, then they dump the long portion of the box and trade the short normally. This would be a legitimate reason to short the box without the purpose of evading tax.",159

My question about ""exit strategy"" is an example. It's not about ""a good ROI"" before you would consider selling. In venture funding - which is really what Reg CF/A+ offerings are - there is extremely low liquidity. Ie - there is no price discovery mechanism and there is little to no secondary market for these types of investments. So - investors need to understand if there will be some sort of liquidity event or exit strategy for the investment. Typically - this can take years or decades depending on the business.

"You should absolutely open one. If you're interested in retiring early, I'll point you to r/fire but the advantages of having the money you want to withdraw after you're 59.5 would be well worth it.",165
Yes. That's the only correct answer.,165
"Yes, you should contribute as much to a Roth IRA as you can if you are within the income limits for contributing. After that, or if you make too much money to contribute to a Roth IRA, you should contribute to a pretax 401k up to that limit. Once that is maximized you should contribute to a post-tax 401k and post-tax traditional IRA up to those limits, and convert the post-tax contributions to a Roth IRA every year (the ""backdoor Roth""). Finally if you find yourself in a low income year, like between jobs, you should convert your old pre-tax 401k to a Roth IRA to minimize the tax.

There are two reasons the Roth IRA is so good. You can withdraw the gains tax-free at 59.5 years old. Second, and more relevant to your situation, after a certain number of years you can withdraw from a Roth IRA without a penalty (but you pay normal taxes). 401ks don't allow this without a 10% penalty. Say you have more than enough in retirement accounts by age 50, and want to retire early. You can take some money out (paying ordinary income tax) to bridge you for the next 9 years.

The rules for withdrawal from a Roth IRA are:

1) If you contributed normally, you can withdraw anytime with no penalty. You already paid tax on this before contributing it. But you have to be below a certain income to be allowed to contribute normally.

2) If you converted a post-tax traditional IRA, or a post-tax 401k, you have to wait 5 tax years to withdraw. If you convert every year, after five years you have a ladder of contributions that are available to withdraw each year. You've also already paid tax on these before contributing.

3) Gains that happened in your Roth IRA from your investments. If you're over 59.5, you can withdraw tax-free. However! Once you've had any Roth IRA open for five years, you can withdraw any gains from any Roth at any age, any time the gains are made. So you should open a Roth now and in five years any gains are available. But until 59.5, you must pay ordinary taxes (but no penaltly).

In summary, it's better to have as much as you can in a Roth IRA, if you were going to invest that money in a post-tax broker anyway, as long as you have a minimum five year investment horizon. If so, you get your money available for anything after five years exactly as if you had put it with a broker, while keeping the option to have the money tax-free after 59.5. Roth IRA accounts are also self-directed so you can buy individual stocks, even options, if that's your thing, and defer the taxes on the gains.",165
"Hell yes, immediately.
If you really need to, You can withdraw any of the contributions (basis) at any time, penalty and tax free.
Then later in retirement age, you do the same for the contributions and/or gains.",165
"All depends on your goals. If you want to retire before 59.5 then don’t. If you don’t mind waiting till then, 100% yes. If you make good money do a taxable and a Roth. Max out the roth it’s only 6500 a year and then throw a shit Ton into a taxable. Remember long term capital gains depending on the amount can be withdrawn TAX FREE. And even the tax rates are extremely low for higher withdraws",165
"Even if you plan on pursuing FIRE with the intent of retiring early you should be investing into tax advantaged accounts. There are ways to withdraw early, but you should also pursue them in case FIRE ends up being a totally bullshit lazily thrown together approach to a stable retirement (outdated withdrawal rates, bad advice to only buy US indices, far too optimistic expectations on stock returns, far too pessimistic ideas on the effects of bonds).",165
"Yes, you should Roth. Especially if most of your income falls into a lower tax bracket. Later in life when you're pulling in a bigger salary and paying higher taxes, switch to maxing out your 401k.",165
/thread,165
Even depending on their goals they should still have a Roth IRA at the minimum since it’s contribution limit is relatively low in comparison to the 401k contribution limit- You should still think for your elderly self and have a back up plan B if by any chance that your income in retirement ceases to exist. Their future self will only thank them for that extra tax growth money:),165
It’s almost as though that’s what I said…. And also having money in other brokerages accounts it’s still growing. You’re acting as though I told him to NOT invest in anything. Putting money in a taxable is also thinking about your future self.,165

"List of available money market funds at TDA and Schwab can be found here - [https://www.schwab.com/money-market-funds](https://www.schwab.com/money-market-funds) 

The choice of fund depends on your personal situation and preferences. 

Schwab no longer offers a mmf sweep. An investor can handle cash management in their portfolio in whatever way suits their needs - whether it's a mmf, laddered treasuries, laddered CDs, box spreads, etc. etc.",166
What is mmf sweep?,166
"In the context of brokers in the US - a sweep is a type of product where the broker automatically transfers uninvested cash in a customer's account to some other account. The other account may be a money market mutual fund or a high yield savings bank account. This allows a customer to earn interest on the uninvested cash.

MMF or sometimes MMMF is casual acronym for a money market mutual fund.

Fidelity which OP referenced offers a money market sweep service. Many brokers  such as Schwab stopped offering a mmf sweep service because of some liquidity issues with money market funds. But since 2008 and more recently in the past year - there have been changes to money market fund liquidity requirements.

This will probably bug me for the rest of the week.

I have a recollection that I saw some sort of insurance trust or wrap structured product as holdings in an ETF which I recall simulated a put-write or collar.

Although - I may be remembering it wrong altogether. And I may also just be confusing it with an insurance wrap used in a GIFs and stable funds because I was also looking at those products.",168
"yeah these are also available from banks as structured notes (as are autocallables) and you sometimes see asset managers buy them up.  not sure why you would want to own an etf that is essentially a wrapper for structured note, since it just layers on fees, versus having the etf itself trade the collar.

&#x200B;

(and as you or maybe others pointed out) these arnt rocket science, esp with us equity indices you just roll the collar 4 times a year inline with the futures, thats how insurance companies implement them.",168
Totally agree. That why I was so curious about those products. I was trying to figure out how those notes work.,168
"generally (i work in asset management for institutional investors) we will only wrap products up in structured notes if the investor specifically needs a fixed income like product for whatever reason.  its a backdoor kind of way to get non-fixed income exposure in a fixed income package.  a common type product would be some strategy returns as the floating leg returns of the structured note, coupled with a banks CP to give it a credit rating.  looks like a 0 coupon variable rate bond, but your exposure can be whatever you want.

we almost always try to talk them out of that, because even down that road, the note itself carries a layer of fees from the bank issuing it, versus just buying the strategy returns directly through a managed account or some LP structure of their choosing.   but to each there own.  (its almost always non-us clients that do it for some reason)",168

"I’m 31 and my retirement time horizon is at least 20+ years away.  I’m confident that the market will continue higher based off of simple economic principles.  If that direction changes for the worse, the money I’ve invested probably won’t be of any help to me otherwise.",171
"Another is that even if you invested all your money on the absolute worst time, November 2007, you've still made an average 9.4% annual return.  What about at the absolute worst time for the dotcom bubble, July 2000, still made 6.9% annually since then.  If you invest only at the worst times in history you're still going to do pretty well as long as you stay the course.

And if you invested all your money into Nikkei in January 1990, well that's just a case study to use diversification.  Don't put all your money in the SP500 if you feel that way.",171
And it’s more than that. Those 10 days are often coupled right around the worsts days. I always remind people about that when they see a 4% drop “crash” and fear further declines. Sure it might. But you don’t know and you’re likely to miss out on the 4% rebound days if you try to time it.,171

> Luckily, while Bob couldn’t time his buys, he never sold out of the market even once.  He didn’t sell after the bear market of 1973-74 or the Black Monday in 1987 or the technology bust in 2000 or the financial crisis of 2007-09.
He never sold a single share.

> Even though he only bought at the very top of the market, Bob still ended up a millionaire with $1.1 million. (On $184,000 invested)",171
And that’s just using worst luck lump sum investing. Periodic investments in the Nikkei would have done much better for example. Not as good as the S&P but you can run backtests on the Fidelity Japan fun going back to like 1990 and monthly contributions do quite well.,171
"Everything is securitized these days.  Bundles of mortgages are sold as MBS (mortgage backed securities).  Note the letter you got didn't say the noteholder changes it said the servicer changed.

Note the YTM is 6.74% however it can be called at any point after 05/31/2024.  The yield to worst (called as early as allowed) is only 5.1%.  If rates remain the same or rise the bond is unlikely to be called but if rates fall then there is a good chance it will be called.  Will it be called on exactly 05/31?  Maybe not but it is unlikely the bond will be the full 10 years to maturity.",172

"Lots of people skip the bank part and lend money privately. They lend money in exchange for notes secured by title insured mortgages on real property. This is called hard money lending and is usually short term (6 months to a year) and high interest rates (12%+).  The idea is to have a very low LTV so if there is a default, there's less risk of losing money. In many cases, the actual goal is to gain possession of the land itself through foreclosure since people only turn to hard money lenders in situations where they cannot obtain normal bank financing.",172
"In 2019 I brokered the sale of a property where the seller held the mortgage after buyer put up a large down payment. Note rate was 6% with a 3 year term.

I teamed up with 2 others and bought the note for $250,000. I had to refinance my house...at 3% for my portion. I make a great spread (3%) on $85,000!

"Well I think you mean

you buy 100 shares of X for $10 a share.

You then write a covered call with a strike of $11 and for this stock you collected a premium of $1 a contract. If the stock goes to $100 the call expires and you sell your shares for $11

Your profit would be $100 from the sale of the stock (bought 100 shares @ 10 then Sold 100 shares @ $11) and $100 from the options premium

so your profit would be $200

Now I think you are talking about opportunity cost, if you just held you would have made much more money. However opportunity cost is opportunity cost not losses. If you sort of expanded opportunity cost to every possible investment well you probably have millions of ""losses"" every day, every day there is probably some stock or derivative that gains 1000% that you in theory could have bought and made 1000% so if you count opportunity cost as losses well you probably have millions of dollars of losses every day because you did not buy the best performing investment of that day",173

"History says that you should invest it all in an index fund now and add to it regularly over time with any spare cash you have from your paycheck.

If you want to hedge your bets then put some of it in treasury bills - the rates are comparable, if not better than, most CDs and you won't have to pay state tax (if applicable).  You could also dump that in a bond etf.  But definitely don't stretch this out over 5 years unless you have zero appetite for risk (in which case you wouldn't be investing it in an index fund anyway).",174
The general knowledge spread around is that historically speaking investing all of the money as soon as you have it rather than slowly investing it over time (Dollar Cost Averaging) results in a greater return 70% of the time.

However, it's vital to understand that the outcome is not a reliable indicator of whether your decision was correct. The future is inherently uncertain, and outcomes can only be assessed in hindsight.

As many have pointed out, the prudent approach, given the inevitable uncertainty we all face, is to invest everything at once. This remains the most logical course of action, regardless of the results.

In any event, don't overthink it. You may opt for dollar-cost averaging if it suits you, provided you don't excessively stretch out your investments. Just remember, this is more about managing your psychology than your finances.",174
Find a high paying Money Market Fund like SPAXX at Fidelity (paying around 4.99% interest right now) and you will save yourself the trouble of CD laddering. I like Treasuries better than CDs right now with the uncertainty in regional banks (like the ones offering the high interest brokered CDs),174

The most-appropriate asset (e.g., cash, bonds, stocks) is determined by your savings / investing time horizon and risk tolerance. If you don't need the money for 20-25 years, you should probably invest / save it in stocks.

Annual stock market volatility is \~20%. You could buy an index fund for $100 and it drops to $80. You might miss out on $20 by investing.

At an annual growth rate of 6% over 20 years, a $100 investment would grow to $320. Over 15 years, a $100 investment with the same growth rate would grow to $240. You might miss out on $80 of growth ($320 - $240) by delaying your investment for 5 years.

That indeed creates a bit of psychological pressure: I really don't want to screw up a major financial decision.

"Longer term, the cable TV model is dead and we will see a steady drop in subscribers until they give up.  The model basically has survived because the content costs are spread amongst all subscribers, independent of if they watch that content.

This will end up with a streaming cable replacement, which will replicate a lot of the worst features of cable TV with a much more fragemented viewing experience.

"Hello!

A few answers

\- relationship between yield and credit rating not that straightforward (though you are directionally right of course). In theory, extra spread over lifetime = loss in default \* probability of default.  But it never exactly works like that due to market levels changing with general risk appetite, sector preferences etc. 

\- very often the market yield will change before the rating actually changes. Agencies usually warn of a downgrade with a negative outlook/watch before it happens. And often the market is quicker to anticipate trouble than the agencies are. 

Ratings matter a lot to the market because a lot of funds can only invest in certain types of ratings (especially when you come to the Investment Grade / Speculative Grade border).  For US government bonds, they are still seen as the world's safest and most liquid bond investment, so even if there is a small rating change, they will keep that appeal....for now!",179
"The spread does not directly equal the probability of default. Most defaults result in some recovery for senior bonds, not total loss. Also there is a credit premium component beyond just a spread to offset defaults - investors demand higher expected return for more risky assets, and that premium can change over time.",179
"technically it's 50% and 100% greater than the baseline (govt. bonds), not 2 and 4%.",179
The spread is the market implied value for the credit and duration risk. Assuming the duration risk is the same for both bonds then the 2% represents the yield demanded by investors to take on higher credit risk. This spread can vary significantly over time depending on the market's appetite for risk and desire for yield - it's not directly proportional to the probability of default.,179
"That doesn't make sense. If the chance of AAA govt bonds defaulting is 0.1%, we would all very gladly multiply that risk for multiple times that 4% gain. (i.e. get 8% for a 0.2% risk of default)

It should be additional. So if AAA govt bonds have 0.1% risk and 4% yield, than a bond with 6% yield should fairly have 2.1% chance of default.

Of course one could say it should be a bit less because taking risk must have a +EV reward. And thats what i'm asking. Insights on how they really relate. How much less ?There must be some knowledge / study on this topic ?",179
"Google helpt me out quite a bit. Interesting and remarkable findings though.  
This table shows the actual risks related to the credid ratings.  


Now i was looking at some bonds. The safest AAA govt bonds yield around 3.5%.  


The best yielding bonds are douglas GMBH @ 7%.   
Douglas however has a B- rating and according to the table that means about 7% chance of default in the first year !  


Getting only 3.5% extra yield for 7% chance of default sounds stupid obviously. I suppose there must be investors who know the company well enough to trust it not going down before its 2026 maturity.  
Another one is whiz air finance @ 6% yield. and BBB-   
With a 0.25% chance of default in the first year, that seems a much better deal.

"If you’re only looking to use the income, it’s gonna take a while before 5% yield pays for a trip of any consequence.

This being said; the best bet is in US Treasury bills, in part because they are exempt from state tax if that applies to you..

"Do the math on how much you need to have invested to generate the income you are hoping for.

After 10 years a balance of $18,000 would generate \~$900 - enough for a short, cheap vacation ten years from now.

"Covered puts/calls for 1%?

This may be a silly question, but I’m curious what others think or if I have a skewed understanding. I have quite a bit invested into a singular stock with the expectation of selling covered calls each week to reduce “buy in” price and generate further capital. However, I’m not always sure if I’m doing it in the most efficient way. I also typically will sell covered puts, as overall I’m bullish, but appreciate being able to hold off on buying and watching how the market moves.

My question is, in this situation, 1% per week would be a great number to aspire to, correct? For example, if I sell a covered put at $1 for .01, I’ve allocated $100 for the week to make one dollar. (Most important piece is that each of these sales happen within a weeks time, I never sell beyond that time frame). Assuming the stock price is literally stagnant for the entire year, this would be a +52% gain for the year per $100. 

Hopefully this makes sense, I’m just wondering A) is there a more efficient way to do this? B) is there benefit to setting the date for the covered call/put further out than EoW?

Also, I very much am aware that stocks go up and down and that the idea of covered calls/puts is to have stock be purchased/sold. This is mainly hypothetical to make sure that I’m thinking about things in a logical way, and if not how to best utilize my funds. Thanks so much!!",183

">Wouldn't I lose all my gains if I were to keep buying at a market value if the price keeps going up?

If the price keeps going up, you would want to invest as early as possible.  However, this is not a true statement.  The price doesn't always go up in the short term.  Which is why many find it more agreeable to dollar cost average to average out the buy in.

However, I have to say your question strikes me as a bit weird, asking about buying at only one time and letting it sit.  What portion of the population are you assuming has all the wealth they will ever want to invest available to them all at once, for them to then invest it?  From my perspective this is a ridiculous assumption.

"Qualified participants can submit the stock shares and receive ETF shares and then sell them.  They will do that for an instant zero risk arbitrage if the price trades above the NAV.  Likewise they can submit ETF shares and receive the underly stock shares and sell those.  They will do that for aninstant zero risk abritrage if the price trades below the NAV.

The submission and redemption process keeps the price very close to the NAV at all times.

The short answer is no the price will not diverge from the NAV by 20% in fact it is extremely rare for it to diverge by even 0.2% and diverging by 1% even for a brief period of time happens only under the most exception circumstances (i.e. briefly in sharpest part of the 2008 crash).",188

"How does that work for a bond etf like BND, where the individual bonds that make up the fund are not known?",188
Thanks for the info,188
Thanks for the info,188
Thanks,188
"Note this is a very interesting question and there was a lot written about in during the covid crash of 2020

Bond ETFs like LQD seemingly did trade at a wide discount from the underlying bonds

So the question was sort of like a chicken or an egg questions.

Some people saw this as somewhat a failure of ETFs saying the price of an ETF can in fact diverge from the underlying assets

Others pointed out the underlying assets were just so non liquid that in fact the ETF was pricing the assets right and the price of the underlying assets were wrong

However the chaos really only happened for a few days then the price of the ETF and underlying assets did converge and the price difference really only happened for a short couple of days",188
"Bond valuation is much more precise and formulaic than stock valuation. For investment grade bonds, its mostly about duration, then credit quality at the margin. So the individual bonds in BND may not be exactly replicable by an arbitrageur, but they can get close enough with substitutes. If BND was yielding any lower than even a small sampling of bonds with a similar duration and credit quality mix, then investors would promptly sell BND until its yield rose to match those other bonds.",188
The individual bonds are known even when not publicly they are known to qualified participants.,188
"Firstly, they are known. The holdings of most ETFs are published daily. (Some active ETFs have approval to delay for a quarter I think)   

Secondly, creation and redemption use the fund's creation and redemption baskets which list stuff the fund wants or wants to get rid of and may be different from everything the fund currently has. Some funds also accept cash.",188
"It’s fairly simple actually. If the price gets to low, authorized participants deliver shares to the etf sponsor in exchange for shares of the underlying stock. If the price gets to high, the AP delivers shares of stock in exchange for shares of the etf which lowers the price.  

What the AP does to hedge their exposure can be complicated.",188

"Best way to learn is to just do it! You're going to get a lot of advice talking purely about financials and stuff but honestly, my best stock picks (Nvidia/Apple) have been because I really like using their products and knew that others did too! I didn't even look at their finances. 

GTA6 is likely going to be the biggest revenue-producing game EVER so if I wasn't higher conviction on other stocks and crypto these days I'd be strongly thinking about it too. Some will say it's 'priced in' already but that's bullshit. The risk is if the game doesn't match or beat expectations but Rockstar haven't really messed up a game yet.

There's a lot to be said about just sitting back and putting money into ETF's like a boring fuck but honestly, if you're already thinking about specific companies Take Two is an excellent one that's super unlikely to bankrupt so the risk is likely upside.

Do your research and make sure you're comfortable but if it's not a bucketload of money I would say any sort of regular investing into individual stocks or ETF's is going to be a great start to your wealth building journey",190

"Everyone is looking at the winners but why no one is making similar posts for losers.

PYPL fell 83% from all time highs and there is no sign it can recover.
We talk about a company which is highly profitable, keep growing and have all ingredients for huge spike in the share price. 
Which has not happened and no one knows when and if will happen. 

It's easy to see META as successful example, since it recovered so fast, but what if sentiment remained bearish and stock was still tradings below 100s?

If you remember, META stock start falling when they reported fall in the daily active users (from 2.95billion to 2.94).
And all articles were how this is a ""My space"" moment, when a social media company start losing users. 

What if this trend had continued? 
What if the daily active users were keep falling every quarter going to Reddit, Snapchat or TikTok and avoiding completely FB and IG? 

Could you predict that DAU will start increasing after a minor dip in one quarter? 

Even Zuckerberg could not predict that (if he could he would make suck remark on the quarterly reports) so who a normal investor could predict it? 

As Munger said: Investment is not easy, otherwise everyone would do it. 

For every META which fell 70% and recover there is a PYPL which fell 80% and never recover. 

Normal investors have no way to pick the winners from the losers and if they do its simple luck.

Facebook was slaughtered, dropped 75% yet everyone was like ""Facebooks time is gone, Metaverse is never taking off, TikTok is eating it's lunch, Facebooks brand is toxic, history has shown every big company has a downfall eventually, Apples changes to advertising is gonna hurt FB""

Now the stock is up 260% in the last year and I don't see too many millionaires who went all in on the ""massive discount"". Because it's easy to say you'll go all in if it drops 50%, but when it does drop 50%, there's a reason for it doing so.",195

It was a core holding of mine and one of my most successful investments of all time. I had nearly doubled my money but when they lost 75% of their value I sold.

They understood that there core technology could support hundreds of layers of technology, point of sale purchases, advertising, sales of virtual real estate, using all the data gleaned from Facebook over a decade.

But the public saw it as second life minus one. And of course the “analysts” shorted the fuck out of it driving it into the ground.",195
"Exactly.  Metaverse was literally killing facebook, and they threw tens of billions of dollars at a covid fever dream.  

It's not even remotely surprising why investors were worried. 

Zuckerberg getting distracted by Twitter's demise and the AI revolution is the only thing that helped turned the tide for Meta.",195
"Yup.  The trick is to find an overwhelmingly bad narrative that doesn’t effect the underlying business.  In the case of meta the narratinve was Zuckerberg is an idiot, Facebook is dying and the meta verse will never work.  But meta was still raking in cash as fast as ever and the core businesses were solid.

In these situations if and when the narrative changes you can do very well.  But it can be tough to hold a losing position when the whole world is constantly saying “you’re wrong”",195
"Most companies drop for a reason, some companies drop for a stupid reason. Meta is an easy one to point to because they weren’t taking on debt to fund their metaverse projects, they were using FCF they were raking in from their other platforms.

It was obvious that the company could easily pivot from wasting their money on metaverse projects to more cash positive ventures, so that massive drawdown was the market being completely irrational to a short term cash burn.",195
"So funny bc META was trading at a 75% discount from its ATH earlier this year and everyone on this sub and elsewhere was acting like buying it at <$100 was like buying Blockbuster stock in 2006.

I mean you can use 10% but that seems a little steep rn. However if you have an investment that you know will return 10% that should be your discount rate.,210
"Came from an investment banking background, yep 10% is commonly used as a rule of thumb.

To calculate a discount rate specific to a company, we usually use WACC (weighted average cost of capital). You can google it and there are sites that explain it way better than I can. Happy to answer any questions you have after reviewing those.

In essence, it calculates the weighted rate of return a company’s debt and equity investors expect. This takes into account the weighted average interest of a company’s debt, as well as the expected rate of return equity holders demand given the risk profile of a company",210
I've never heard of using a flat 10% discount rate. I feel you should calculate your own discount rate.,210
Nein! It was always 9.,210
For sure but how many investments exist where we know we get 10% 😅?,210
"WACC always seemed peculiar to me.  Opportunity cost and expected returns of investments of similar risk seems to make much more sense.

For example I've seen WACC rates ranging from 9.5% to 12% for AAPL.  That seems absurd?

Munger has often said he thinks WACC is BS and using it leads to circular reasoning to a degree.",210
"wacc formula

WACC= \frac {{\sum ^N _{i=1}}{r_i \cdot MV_i}} {{\sum ^N _{i=1}MV_i}}

WACC	=	weighted average cost of capital

N	=	number of sources of capital (securities, types of liabilities)

r_i	=	required rate of return for security

i	=	security

MV_i	=	market value of all outstanding securities

or

WACC=( 
V
E
​	 ×Re)+( 
V
D
​	 ×Rd×(1−Tc))

where:

E=Market value of the firm’s equity

D=Market value of the firm’s debt

V=E+D

Re=Cost of equity

Rd=Cost of debt

Tc=Corporate tax rate
​	

10% is used gross or net of wacc?",210
What are some sample WACC rates you've used for large companies lately? Just curious.,210
"I see it in DCFs often on Reddit.  Value Investing YTers like Sven Carlin use 10%.

What discount rate have you used for example a company like GOOGL?",210
"Individually?   Rare.  But my net this year across everything is above that, so I'm satisfied (so far... who knows what December will bring)",210
"I think that’s what WACC is (expected return of investment based on risk profile and opportunity cost of entering an investment of similar risk).

Agreed with the Munger idea, WACC is by definition a market defined cost of capital (as is the valuation of all public companies). Finance is definitely more of an art than science",210
"Sven Carlin isn't a very good person to follow for investing advices by the way. The guy is a forever big crash coming. Aswath damodaran teaches valuations at NYU and post his lectures on YouTube. Start with him. He uses 10 year rate + risk premiums, which he thinks averages around 5-5.5% sp500 long term.",210
"Totally, wasn't saying you should follow him.  He uses 10% and I'm saying it's too high.  Just giving examples that it's considered a very common minimum return for people.

5% sounds super reasonable and using that would make companies like GOOGL or AAPL extremely undervalued.",210
"No it's (10 year rate + 5% risk premium) = around 9.4% right now, but 5 years ago around 7.5%.",210
"5% risk premium?  How does he justify that?  That seems way too high.  If you're talking about his ERP paper, it seems like that was various approaches used during ZIRP.

9.5%-10% from this point forward seems completely unrealistic and ridiculously conservative?

He said market is very fairly valued currently so I don't think he is using 5.5% anymore in this environment which implies 10% discount rate.",210
"RSUs are income. Not selling is equivalent to taking that portion of your income and using it to buy stock. If that's what you'd do with the money anyway because you like the investment, then keep the RSUs. If you think there is a better place for your income, then sell them immediately. They are taxed like ordinary income in that case.

The timing of your company's rally is unfortunate, but irrelevant to this decision.

To answer your question, I sell my RSU and ESPP shares immediately, because I think I can yield a better return on that money elsewhere.",211
"Sell it and diversify into mutual funds. If they gave me that much in cash, I wouldn’t buy it all in stock.",211
I sell it,211
"I sell ***immediately*** and then reinvest elsewhere.

I only max out ESPP bc of the look back and discount it provides… essentially free money if you sell immediately.",211
"I used to receive RSU in last company. I maxed out my ESPP too. Never sold a penny. 

I had conviction on it doing good. It's risen 3x in 4 years. No regrets.",211
Sell it then buy VOO/ QQQ.,211
"ESPP is great when the business is good, and the share price is going up. It is horrible when the business isn’t doing well, the SP is tanking and you are at risk of losing your job. 

I bought my competitor’s stocks, of course there wasn’t any ESPP discount, but boy did I have that silver lining when things looked bad.",211
Depends on the company performance vs other options. Don't automatically sell because the textbook answer says so.,211
"My currenr employer is very stable, highly profitable, and fairly recession proof. I keep these RSU and ESPP shares. My prior employer was run by clowns so I sold as soon as they were released.",211
"I immediately sell the ESPP for the insta gains. I have been just using that money to pay bills. Gives me more flexibility to crank up my monthly investing into retirement and my brokerage account. RSU I make that decision each quarter. Sometimes I liquidate and use that to buy something, sometimes I hold, sometimes I liquidate and immediately buy an ETF.",211
I hold onto it and good thing I did since it has gone up by $9 from 47 to almost 56 this year plus the dividend isnt that bad with 0.24 per share.,211
"Don’t feel bad. Everyone knows that’s how the markets work. If you sell it, it goes higher. If you buy it, it goes lower. 

Rationally though, the bottom and top of the market only lasts for a fleeting moment, 97% of the time you aren’t gonna sell near the top or buy near the bottom. So just accept it, sell when you’re happy with the profits. Buy when you think the prices are reasonable. 

No one lost money from taking profits.",211
"I sell the majority of mine to de-risk. My income, and a large part of my near term future net worth is all in one company. It’s a good company, but that’s a highly non-diversified position.",211
I'm so glad this is the top comment. Far too many people don't understand that the decision not to sell a stock should be made on the exact same basis as the decision to buy a stock (apart from any tax considerations or trading fees).,211
"ESPP is still great when things are down, depending on how it's structured. During the early part of this year, I got a guaranteed 15% return even though the company stock price was down and the overall market was down.",211
Wash sale is 30 days before and after. Has nothing to do with the year,212
"Wash sale only applied if you sold at a ""loss"" and buy them back within 30 days before or 30 days after the day of the sale.

If you sold for a gain, you can re-enter the position anytime.

Example: If you sell your original position on Dec 29th, 2023 at a loss, and buy them back, let's just say, either Dec 15th, 2023 or on Jan 1st, 2024, wash sale would apply for both dates.",212
"Are you telling me that higher beta stocks went up proportionally more than the general market?

I, for one, am shocked.",213
"I don't think all of these are large cap, though I admit I haven't heard of most of them.

It's not hard to cherry pick stocks that did well last month and add them to a list.",213
Why would PARA sell near multiyear lows? During which they couldn't produce any new shows/movies because multiple strikes took place at same time. And the ad market collapsed.,214
"The short answer is going to be that they don't have anything to gain by buying them out. An outright purchase would be at (most likely) slightly above FV as no one is realistically going to sell for below (without hidden knowledge). Apple would be banking on their internal knowledge to increase the valuation, which while they have some they don't have much, and so they gain very little by outright purchasing.

The problem for these mid-tier studios is they aren't big enough to start their own platform but are too big and have lots of existing cost structures. Enter in Apple which has a huge platform. So with rates what they are, cash on hand (in safe investment vehicles) is more valuable than the acquisition (unless the asset is highly distressed through mismanagement that is correctable) so a partnership is a less risky play for both entities.",214
"Did OP see the Apple TV/Paramount partnership thread. And instead of responding inside that thread made their own thread that obviously isn't going to be true. Since in order for Amazon/Apple to buy Paramount has to sell and they haven't even hinted at it yet.

It is way cheaper to just license their content instead of buying the entire company.",214
Why u askin’ me ?,214
"Apple and Amazon both produce their own content, but that's not the core part of their business. They aren't production companies and don't want to be. Straight-up buying a media company is rarely a good idea. Just ask AT&T and Comcast. 

Streaming is in a weird place right now. Cord-cutting is continuing, but price increases have customers bouncing around and nobody has quite figured out the new ad market yet. It's cheaper (and safer) to just license most of your content and put out a few of your own passion/prestige projects as exclusives. Production companies are money pits.",214
That’s like saying I like the gum my local grocery sells so I am going to buy the whole store,214
"AAPL doesnt make large acquisitions.  Its largest acquisition, to date, was Beats Electronics in 2014.  That was more for tax purposes than Beats IP or business.

AMZN just acquired MGM, so they already have know how in the industry.

Between Paramount and Lionsgate, I would say Lionsgate is the more interesting acquisition.",214
Same reason why you don’t buy things: ain’t worth it.,214
Woudnt it be the oposite? The stock is going down due to competition and therefore shareholders would prefer to sell or merge.,214
"> Since in order for Amazon/Apple to buy Paramount has to sell and they haven't even hinted at it yet.

Not quite true. Apple or Amazon could just engage in a hostile takeover (snap up shares on the open market). Of course, it’s cheaper if Paramount willfully sells itself. Apple and Amazon just don’t want the studio that much.",214
You looked like a cool dude,214

Rate cuts means cheaper money for companies, fewer options for idle cash, and price appreciation for existing bonds.",229
"Bonds have had a brutal year until this month.  Bond yields go up as demand goes down.  They reached 5% as interest rate uncertainty continued to make traders use other investments.  Now that Wall Street has decided rate hikes are done, people are jumping back into bonds like crazy, causing yields to plummet.  Stock prices have gone up this last month for many of the same reasons.  They’ve been tepid the last week or so as people are starting to realize all is not well in the economy as consumer debt rises, unemployment rises and general sentiment is down.  

If rate hikes are done bonds will continue to sell and stocks will go up or down based on consumer data.  

If the fed lowers rates bond purchases will skyrocket and stocks will likely rise.  

If the fed raises rates bond purchases will plummet and yields will rise.  The stock market will likely go down.",229
"There's about a 6mth-1year delay. This is because of the way debt works. Rates have risen, but this is for new debt. Companies won't have to pay those new rates until they need to restructure their short term debt. Which can be 1-3 years.

Also, I think the market is pricing in 4 rate cuts while the Fed is only predicting two, but why would rate cuts that aren't coming for at least 3 months (I think that's the soonest estimate) cause such diversion?",229
"This makes sense. Basically money is flowing out of stocks and into bonds as the market decided rates have peaked and now's the time to buy.

"My understanding is that after the last rate hike in a cycle stocks should fall, but they still largely rallied as rates declined. My assumption for why that happened was that investors were still bought into the soft-landing premise + a decline in rates should make stocks more appealing, and that this dynamic was giving the stock market some insulation.

I'm not seeing the same relationship now even though rates continued to decline below 4.5% and Fed data was in-line with expectations, so the change in the dynamic is what threw me the most.

I think you’re trying to apply quantitative data and reasoning to a qualitative market.",229
"are you familiar with bonds? if not, you should do some research into why fixed income is relevant when considering equities.

TL;DR if you could invest in something that is risk free and get 5%, why would you invest in something that is risky and might not yield 5%? The emphasis is on risk-free.

What if that number drops to 2%? or 1%? or increases to 10%?

Equities increase when the risk-free rate drops because they become more attractive, relatively. Inversely, equities decrease when the risk-free rate increases. However, sometimes the risk-free rate drops/increases or is expected to increase/decrease because of outside forces (such as a financial crisis or inflation or future fed meetings) so it's much more complicated than that.",229
"Rates will be the primary driving force.     Everyone is banking on the rate hikes being done and a decent percentage think rates will start to drop next year as inflation lowers and economic data cools off.  If this changes it will affect bonds and stocks.  

Other things to look at will be the dollar.  The dollar has dropped in the last month and if it continues to do so, as people move cash into bonds or the market, this may reignite inflation as people pay more money for the same goods.  

Consumer debt, corporate debt and the economy are oddly the final and last driving force.  If cracks appear in these the market may plummet even as the fed is cutting rates.  Always tough to see when something is going to break.  This bond flurry should also be helping corporate debt, since corporate yields were rising for the same reason as treasuries until recently.",229
"Go chart either government bond prices vs stocks or government bond interest rates vs stocks and you'll see it happen. At almost every major draw down, rates go down and bond prices spike as investors sell off their stocks and move into safer assets. 

The competition between stocks and bonds always heats up when interest rates get near to the long term average returns on stocks. 5% risk free government debt looks good compared to 8% average returns that are subject to volatility. So on a risk adjusted basis, the risk free return is a much better deal. 

The larger explanation would center around valuations being overbought and risk premiums have been essentially traded away.",229
"I understand the relationship at a basic level and I do maintain a small-but-growing bond portfolio in addition to stock and options trading, but yeah - i'm a novice investor with only \~ 1yr of active portfolio management under my belt so when market dynamics change it takes me awhile to figure out what's going on. I've been profitable for about 4 months of that time so I think i'm still doing better than most newer traders.

Agree with your premise. Perhaps the divergence is related to increasing confidence that rates have peaked and folks want to secure those rates before they move lower... Thanks for your feedback!",229
"TQQQ is not meant for long term holding, there’s other ways of getting leverage that would be better. For example QQQ is down 5% since its peak in 2021 and TQQQ is down 50%",230

So if you have 3 consecutive crash, even if price return to normal you will be at 12.5%.

That actually happened recently between 2000~2012.  There are so many big crash and small crash but never reach all time high, you nearly loss everything.  So if you invest 100k in tqqq at the dotcom bubble, a decade later all your money is gone.   

So basically you are gambling if market reach all time high or have crash in between.

You can also take a step back and buy double leverage or swing trade or simply buy low sell high to reduce risk.",230

"Why CROX has been A) beaten down lately and B) it frequently trades at a discount for growth potential.

A) Is easy, they made a bad acquisition and overpaid.  If $2B were around to buyback right now we would be swimming in money.  It's not the end of the world though.  

B) The company is often confused as a style or fashion company.  In my opinion it is not.  I see it more as a utility, staple clothing company like Fruit of the Loom.  It fulfills a genuine need for high quality, durable, breathable footwear that is not open toe.  

It does so very efficiently and with expanding operating margins over the years, producing everything in Vietnam and China.  10 years ago they were struggling with an 8.5% operating margin.  Today they are at 26.5%.   Then they leverage the brand and infrastructure to sell lots of different stuff, do limited edition releases, weird collabs, etc.  They seem to adapt and market well to changing tastes and demands but at the end of the day their core business is something people need in their daily life.

The team has executed well and they kept that momentum going even past Covid.   Just my 2c's and why I plan to keep holding.",232

"Interesting math from the last Crossing Wall Street newsletter:

""I’ll give you an example of how much the market loves low interest rates. I ran a test. I took all the data for the S&P 500 and the three-month Treasury yield over the last 18 months.

I then separated the data into three buckets: days when the three-month Treasury yield fell, days when it increased and days when it stayed flat. Then I looked at how the S&P 500 performed on those days.

On days when the three-month yield increased, the S&P 500 fell at an annualized rate of 7.63%. When the yield was unchanged, so were stocks. The S&P 500 rose at an annualized rate of 0.06%. But when the three-month yield fell, the S&P 500 rose at an annualized rate of 41.4%. Falling rates are the fuel of a stock rally.""

NVDA's forward PE dropped below 25 today.,232
"Agreed, idk why I even post stuff here. Bored of the bull vs. bear mudslinging, tired of the political soapboxing that has little to do with stocks, missing interesting DD and valuations.",232
"Yea. I pretty much go to other subs for any news if I want an in depth discussion. News about Apple credit card go to r/creditcards. News on streaming sector like WBD, DIS, PARA go to r/movies or r/television. News on a tech company go to r/technology. News on drafkings or other sportsbetting stocks go to r/sportsbook. This sub unfortunately isn't the place for that it more for jokes and mega cap tech discussion most of the time.

"Use the track record of ""I suck at timing the market"" and stop fucking trying to time the market.",232
"You seem to like low quality companies too much imo. Every time you talk about the stock market you're namedropping companies like Walgreens, 3M, TGT, Citi, PYPL, BABA. I'm even long one of those, and I'm in fact long a peer of Walgreens (CVS) and was once long TGT. But sometimes your posts would talk about those companies like they're being irrationally priced and stockholders are getting destroyed for no reasons. But these are just occasionally bad businesses or tough industries (semiconductor manufacturing, retail, banking, ...) and mean reversion isn't guaranteed. Having a high dividend is not a guarantee of anything (as many REIT investors found out). C has been a loser for decades. Walgreens is straight up unprofitable. 

I remember you used to post a long while back under a different username. It was you who was heavily into INTC and complaining bitterly about it the entire way down, right? INTC is yet another example of a company struggling and possibly another dividend trap. (and eventually they had to cut their dividend)

Imo if you're going to buy companies like that you need to be prepared for things getting worse or staying bad for longer than a few months or a year or two. Otherwise just stick to the index. I'm not saying these businesses can't do well from here, but if your investing appetite doesn't match these kind of companies, it's a poor idea to try investing in them.

Personally I like investing in lower quality businesses that have been killed (BTU, CVS, PYPL, CROX(?), microcap), but I also don't invest more than I care to take catastrophic losses on, and also invest in higher quality ones too (JPM, assorted big tech, SBUX, V, MA, XOM, LOW).",232
"Every time I see comments like this, it’s because the person is “trading” without any real experience, as opposed to “investing”. Invest in solid companies that you believe in and stop worrying about down periods, they’re going to happen. If you can’t handle that just invest in an index fund and be done with it. Even with ETF investing you’re still going to have to stomach bear markets. I rarely sell out of positions unless outlook of the company has completely changed. I typically look past a bad quarter or two.",232
"Fun fact is that Intel now has a higher forward P/E than NVDA, at 26. AMD is at 37. Curious to see how big the Mi300 (AMD's 'AI' play) will be in the next year or two.

"Hearing Munger speak in the Acquired podcast interview, he specifically said he (and therefore I assume Buffett) don’t like “style companies” in general, and Nike was specifically brought up as an example. In the rare cases where they own apparel businesses, they seem more utilitarian in nature, less tied to brand appeal.

Nike has been an enduring brand for many years…but preferences can and do evolve in unpredictable ways. If you’re someone with no personal knowledge of the winds of fashion and consumer preference that affect a given brand (raising my hand here), it probably makes sense to avoid those brands in general.",234
">Even when tiny incumbents like Hoka

"He bought out Brooks, he owns the company lol.",234
"Great comment. The Charlie Acquired Podcast came to mind as well for me. Yeah, I agree with the takes that Warren's perception of the fashion/apparel business being fickle plays into it, but I also think part of it is that he probably has never been a consumer of these brands.

Reason being is that [he famously once said](https://www.rolexforums.com/showthread.php?t=40873) he'd love to own a Swiss watch manufacturer when asked about Rolex then mentioned that he gave them his number, but still hasn't received a call. He's also mentioned that one of the only luxury things he owns is the Day-Date that he bought decades ago. Rolex is similar to these other brands  in so much as that they started as utilitarian (albeit some more premium than others) and grew into almost pure play luxury/premium brands with strong moats, strong pricing power, etc. - yet, he still likes Rolex as an investment/acquisition ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ the only real difference I can see is that he personally has experience with one product over the other.",234

Price is also a factor.,234
"Deckers, not Dockers. They own Hoka and Ugg, among other things. Hoka in particular has been exploding lately.",234
he bought it basically out of bankruptcy for super cheap.,234

Sounds counterintuitive to me. You are lending out shares to be shorted. So you want your share value to go down?,235
"Most big, highly liquid stocks like that wont yield anything really, the pro's are it can occasionally be a few extra pennies at no cost to you. Can be more if you deal in more... shall we say volatile stocks (memes/pennies/deep value etc.)

Cons I guess are you're are lending them to people who are shorting so it means that there is a consensus among certain market participants that your shares are overvalued or that the price will drop. But if you are confident in your holdings and they are well researched and you have a long time horizon  it shouldn't matter if people want to short the stocks you own. The whole game is being right when others are wrong. When you opt in I feel the terms and conditions that are laid out to you do a pretty good job of explaining the main risks so I would recommend reading them in full.",235
">Is stock lending a good option?

No!",235
"Someone, usually your broker, borrows your shares and pays you a small amount to do so. You maintain economic ownership of your shares and may sell them at any time. The value of your shares is not fixed to the loaned price. If you sell them you will realize any gain/loss on them. Your broker will tell you if you can pick what shares to be eligible or if its your whole portfolio.

Your shares are only at risk if the borrower defaults on its obligations.",235
"no, the person borrowing your shares wants it to go down.",235
"Tell me this. 

If a stock is trading at a bid of 100, and an ask of 101, and someone wants to short the stock and they place a limit order and they under cut the the ask of 101 by 10 cents (100.90), and someone comes along and buys it at 100.90, did the stock go up or down? 

New player to the game got to open their short, but the price went up still. 

Also, now the new short will need to close this position eventually, what happens then? 

It all depends on which side has more urgency to get the trade done, that’s what will dictate direction.",235
I’ve been doing it on one of my stock picks. I’m happy with the company and it’s a fairly small and easily manipulated stock which is trading under what I consider fair value. The money I’m getting I’m using to buy more stock lol.,235

"FTSE is facing very low valuations in general. Whether that trend continues or it’s due a rebound is anyone’s guess. 

For unilever specifically their core brands have not done so well recently, hence the lack of growth. Just my opinion, but I’d think your decision shouldn’t be about dividends but how much you believe those brands and their future strategy will be winners or not. Dividends are nice but growth in earnings underpin both dividends and valuation. With consumer goods, it’s all down to the product. FTSE all world at least would mean you’re more diversified.",237
"I like it. It's seen as a stodgy, low-growth business despite significant exposure to fast growing emerging markets. Starting valuation is great since it's a UK stock and no one want to own UK stocks right now.

Investors have been paying crazy prices to get into the Pet category since COVID,238
"It’s growing at a 30% clip.  Just eyeballing, their incremental margin is ~50%, and they don’t really have any competitors.  The small chance that continues and it becomes a monopoly platform business for pet services is pretty valuable.  

Tbh I think they must see something incredible, because it looks like a good business for public markets — high potential and low cash flows.  Usually I think of PE buying low-mid potential but high cash flow or good assets that can be used to lever the cap structure. Rover has none of that.",238

"In theory if you retain the right to sell the stock at any time, there's not any downside to lending out stocks to be sold short.

In practice the brokerage has a shell company set up to facilitate the lending process and this shell company could become very insolvent very easily in the case that the short sellers either don't pay or become insolvent themselves. In this case you would lose all the shares that are on loan.",242
"It doesn't take away your liquidity at all, and it favors junk because that's usually in high demand to be shorted.",242

"A buyback is just a tax advantaged dividend 

But you don’t actually control that dividend since it technically remains with the company.",245
"In theory it shouldn't really change the valuation of the company if true buying back at fair value, because buybacks improve EPS and book value, but remove cash from the company which should be part of the valuation. Now the real world is a little bit messier, but a 10% jump bar purely on a buyback sounds irrational to me.",245
If insiders are selling while doing buybacks it's a strong signal that management is putting themselves before shareholders.,245
"Company is dying ... They tried to make EVs and lost... Last ditch attempt to keep the stock price alive ... Some will fall for it, while big buys will unload",245
"One of the goals of a company is to maximize their return on invested capital. 

If they have excess capital and they can’t get a good return on that capital, they should return it to shareholders.

There are two main ways to return capital to shareholders. Pay dividends, which is a taxable transaction to investors, and repurchase shares, which increases your percentage ownership of the company. 

If a company has enough cash to repurchase half the company, do you want them to hold on to it and make little return on it, or do you want them to use the money to buy half the company, effectively doubling your ownership?

In situations where the shares are overpriced, a company should issue shares. In a case where shares are undervalued, buying shares makes sense.

Let’s say you own half of a company and it makes $200k per year and is sitting on $1 million of excess cash. It can buy the stock of the other owner, and you would own 100% of the company. So basically, you are now making $200k instead of half of $200k. But you have $1 million less in cash.",245
"Buybacks are probably the best way to deploy capital if your stock is trading lower than it should be. Ford’s trading at a P/E of 6, Toyota at 10. Given GM is at 4, and historically trades at ~6, there’s a pretty good argument this was a fantastic move. 

Most legacy companies give out dividends when it would be significantly more valuable to implement/ supplement with buyback programs.",245
"You’re thinking in extremes lol. Returning capital to shareholders is not a sign the company has run out of investments. I have a lot of thoughts but this is too deep of a topic to type about. You might want to look up some nuanced discussions from experienced investors to learn more. 

The more I think about it, the bigger the can of worms this can open on the topic of return to shareholders. 

Also remember it’s not all black and white. Companies are allowed to allocate a little bit into return to shareholders and also aggressively invest in growth at the same time.

Sometimes companies can only allocate a certain amount of capital before the rest of the capital gets wasted/lower returns on invested capital. The company may elect to return that capital to shareholders and maintain a higher return on capital instead of burning that cash.",245
Returning value to shareholders is the raison d'etre for companies. Buybacks is one of the best ways to do it. There are times a company is flush with cash. Law of diminishing returns would limit the gains from RnD.,245
"Id add that both are signals that the company does not see a better use for the capital (acquisitions, investing in growth/innovation, etc). With that in mind, pay attention to how expensive a stock is when the company does a buyback. If the stock is undervalued (I think GM is at like 5x next year's earnings) then a buyback could be the best use of capital.

Super sad that they could use that money to double down on EVs but instead they decide to pay shareholders instead. Definitely makes it look like management doesnt know how to grow the company,245
"I would agree in certain scenarios, such as if the company is severely undervalued buy backs can make sense, but with GM we’re talking about a company with over $110 billion in debt, and has struggled financially for a long time, with a history of bad decisions. Is this seriously the best use of that money, for the good of the business?",245
"Don't forget, the amount of Capex the company is going to need to spend to continue to ramp up on production of EV's. 

I don't really follow the company, but I'd argue paying down debt or using FCF to invest back into the company to get EV's at a point where they can make money off them would be a way better use of capital than juicing the EPS.",245

Just a couple of months ago GM was claiming they didn't have the money to settle the UAW contract. Now all of the sudden they can find money for a higher dividend and stock buybacks. I hope they get reminded of this when contract talks roll around in another three years.,246

It makes sense the leader in EVs does not need to invest that money in EVs.  There is no way this could backfire.,246
"Tough to see any reason to invest in GM or Ford.

Low or declining shareholder return, no innovation, EV iniatives constantly derailed, massive EV losses, can't ramp up EV's without cannibalization of their ICE sales.

There's a reason no one is buying these legacy automakers and why more money flows into new EV companies.",246
"I commented about the disadvantages of the Big 3 with the union. I should clarify that I am not against or anti union, but it’s not a fair playing field with the nonunion auto companies. I wouldn’t bet my $$ on the big 3.  The strike cost GM $1billion.  Yes the other nonunion gave raises at their own will.  
In the next contract in 4.5 years, the union for example can ask for a huge raise and demand ridiculous incentives or they go on strike which will cost them $$. Eventually the Big 3 will cave out of $$ from the strike and take on more cost. Legacy cost in terms of pensions and insurance. Either cave to the demand or go a long strike that will cripple the bottom line.

Stock buy backs is to prop up the price and get more investments.  Does it work?? Well depends if you have a sound plan that will reward in terms of stock prices and increase dividends for shareholders in the future. Look at Apple. Would you put your $$ in GM or Apple?  The last 30 years of investment in GM wasn’t rosey and it won’t going forward.  Apple, Tesla, and the non union auto have done well from stock price rewards to shareholders. Just remember what Elon once said when asked about the Big 3 getting into EV. He not scared and wish them luck.",246
"And the market rewarded them for this. Huge buyback. 

Absolutely pathetic and of the market to be happy with the stock. No fucking way anyone should buy with the way that management team runs. Such a FOMO short term move.

Shame on them, shame on the market.",246
4 1/2 years but who's counting,246
"The cost of increasing the dividend is like $165 million per year (1,372,000,000 shares outstanding x .03/share x 4 quarters). The buyback is 'accelerated' $10 billion, meaning it was already in the plans over the next couple of years.

The new deal with UAW scales to increase costs by more than $3 billion **per year** by 2028. ($9.3 billion until 2028, continually increasing until being fully implemented at end of Q1 2028).

The UAW deal is still much larger in scale over the long run than either of these moves, and the buyback was going to happen either way eventually.",246
Been that way for a long while now,246
"Both those stocks are good for ""trading"" and not investing. You can almost see the cyclical nature of these stocks with both floors and ceilings.",246
"Agreed, IMHO GM is quite simply screwed at this point, especially if they keep pouring tens of billions into dividends and share buybacks. The EV transition is going to be very expensive and painful, so GM (and other automakers) shouldn't be throwing their precious cash away on short term attempts to pump up the stock price.

Part of the problem with GM is that Mary Barra's pay structure is basically encouraging her to drag her feet on EV's and waste money on short term measures to pump the stock price up. The metrics that she's awarded stock options on are heavily skewed to bringing in profits today from ICE vehicles, metrics which would all be hurt if her and GM took currently unprofitable EV's more seriously. But the fact is that you need to invest that kind of money into money losing EV's in order to build up scale so that you can make and sell them profitably, and ICE vehicles won't be around to subsidize that transition forever.",246

Historically as interest rates rise it leads to a recession due to less credit in the system.  Companies don't borrow to grow their business due to cost of capital.  It usually takes some time to work through the system.  For instance realtors are not selling as many homes so they might lose their job.  Tech had lots of layoffs.  As more people are laid off it affects other businesses down the line since the laid off people are not spending.,248
"Calling a recession is extremely difficult not because it's hard to predict a slowdown, but it's hard to predict when government intervention will fail

Everyone was calling for recession in 2023, were they wrong though? Just want to remind you that we had bank failures early this year and the only reason we didn't enter a recession was due to the interventions and bailouts by the government and the fed

It seems like these guys are always dumb and wrong, but reality is that this shit is impossible to predict because the government always steps in to stop it, you only have recessions when the government fails

This is also why the recessions we do end up getting are so bad, it's because they are the recessions that were so bad that government intervention wasn't even able to stop them",248

If the stock market turns bad I think it’s possible something will come up that makes sense to invest in.

I think the recession may be here and the market is only showing it in specific areas and each will deal with it at different times without a major change in overall sentiment.

In a lonely and stressed world, I think more are flocking to cruising since they are very social and relaxing vacations.

"If you write (sell) a put, someone else is paying you the premium and that money is yours, done and done.

Some people do this to lower their cost basis when entering a position they're waiting for a good deal on, but it's risky in that you could be stuck having to pay way over market price for something that's become a falling knife.

A covered call is collecting premium from someone who will have the option to buy your shares for lower than the market price if it expires in the money. If you write the call without having shares that is indeed naked, and your risk is theoretically unbound as you could be stuck having to buy the shares at an extremely high price in order to sell it for much lower. 

Short selling is when you borrow shares from your broker to sell at current market price with the idea of buying them back for cheaper later to return to your broker. Here your risk is also theoretically unbound as well.",255

If you sell a call or a put, the person you sell to has those rights while you have the obligation to fulfill the contract.  This is where it can get dicey which is what you are asking about.  There is a way to sell options without being naked, ie holding 100 shares of the stock and selling a call is considered a covered call.  If the stock soars you already own the shares to deliver and you just capped your gains - no big deal.  But if a stock goes parabolic and you don't own those shares your loss could theoretically be unlimited.  Not really true since a stock can't go to infinity but its definitely how some people wiped out their entire accounts and even owed their brokerage.  Naked puts are slightly less scary because it can only go to 0 but that's still a shit scenario.",255
"Unlimited loss potentials is one way to say it. Other ways is - losing a shit ton of money.

This happens when you don't have anything to cover the contract you sold. 

Sell a naked call. Game company is at $4. So you think alright it will never hit $10, so you sell a call for a game company at $10, but you don't buy/have 100 shares to cover if it goes in the money (ITM) at $10 or more, well too bad it goes to $300. Broker is reaching out to you wanting 100 shares, now you better go buy 100 shares at $300 each, instead of $4 each. 

Another way is by naked short selling. So you are bearish on a stock, you call your broker, and borrow shares, then turn around and sell those shares to get the cash immediately. Then you wait until the stock goes down, buy back the stock and return it to your broker. You pocket the difference (broker charges a fee though). Well again, bad luck, you sold game company stock at $4, waiting for it to go to $2 but it shot up to $300 each, good luck buying those back to return to your broker. Hedge funds usually employ this method to bring a company to its knees and into bankruptcy. They borrow and sell the stock in the millions, crushing the stock price over a long duration of time.

This response was also very well said and helped me understand. Thank you!,255
"Wow! You have no idea how much this has helped me understand more. Thank you truly. 

So let me ask this... I can avoid the unlimited loss potential by strictly avoiding selling naked all together? So this way my options trading strategy would limited my loss potential since I would have the shares to cover [hypothetically]",255
What a great example! Thank you!,255
"No problem, you are correct in that you should be fine not holding any naked options.  You will be safe selling covered calls, selling cash secured puts on stocks you want to own, and going long calls and puts if you so desire.  There is risk in all of these strategies but you should be able to quantify it when you enter the trade.

&#x200B;

You are not 100% correct in the statement that the risk is the premium paid/owed.  You are automatically half correct if talking about buy-to-open or long options.  If you buy a contract and it is OTM at expiry your max loss is your premium paid.  If you are short an option the max loss can be greater than premium paid to you.  Ie you sell a cash secured put on a stock you want to hold which is trading at 100 and your strike is 90.  The stock goes to 80.  You collected 2 dollars in premium.  Your loss  is 800 per contract because the put is ITM by 10 dollars and you collected 2.

&#x200B;

For short calls which are covered its not succinctly defined in one sentence and I am not a professional which the following will clearly exhibit.  If you buy a stock at 100 and sell a call at 110 which goes ITM and the shares are called away you should be calculating your profit and not a loss.  But if you wanted to consider opportunity or the actual cost to your account if you are a long stock holder simply trying to get extra return with covered calls you would have to consider the loss between the spread of the higher price less your strike+premium.  It could also land somewhere ITM where shares are called away but your premium is higher than the difference.  The thing is, this really matters a lot less unless you sold an ITM strike with a metric shitton of time.  The beauty of covered calls in my opinion is the option to almost never lose.  Rolling up and out for credits is usually an option, no pun intended.",255

"People gain from options primarially due to implied volatility. Take GME today for example. GME moved at peak $3-4 upside


People who bought the Call option at the $30 Strike expiring this week (and bought before the pop) only paid $4 per contract

During the rise up, that $30 strike per contract was now worth $28 

The main risk is new option traders will hold through expiration instead of selling. or are too inexperienced to choose the right stock, timing, or strike price. (Trial and error) 
the top dogs in the stock market dont need spreads or strategies ( like iron condor, vertical, butterfly, etc) Most make a living naked calls and puts, or cash secured puts(advanced)",255
"So options are valued based on a ton of stuff (look up greeks, delta, gamma, theta), but one of which is how volatile the stock is. How slow or how fast it changes. The more volatile a stock, the more valuable the option.

Volatility example:

You and I buy an apple (AAPL) call option today. We paid $1. The underlying stock is currently at $190.

You sold your option for $3 when apple went to $195. Congrats you made $2 profit!
 
I hold, lucky for me apple went to $1000. But I am greedy and don't sell. I go to sleep and wake up. AAPL is back at $195, wtf? I get upset but its ok I'll just sell my option (the same one we bought yesterday) for $500 (500% profit). 

This is because the option is now considered more valuable due to its volatility. Buyers of this option understand that there is a chance it could go back to $1000, so they are willing to pay more for this potential.

Volatility can be seen in the form of earning calls, world disasters (covid, war, banks failing), pharmaceutical trials (check out BIVI, options were priced through the roof because they were about to announce test results of their alzheimer's drug), ceos getting fired (open ai fires CEO and tanked microsoft stock price), a lot of random other crap",255

"> The narrative two months ago was that treasuries were spiking because we couldn't find enough buyers for our debt. Now rates are falling, but we haven't stopped issuing debt, **so something changed there.**


I'm not so sure that much has actually changed there.  Since the big mind shift on never-ending rising 10 year rates, we've had one big bond auction, and that one actually snapped people back to reality, albeit briefly.  

Right now, everyone is partying.  But the next big bond auction one may be a re-sobering event.  There's still a huge amount of deficit spending to get funded.  All that changed is J Frost's proposed schedule/pace.

Of course it's quite possible that the whales who dominate that sector will capitulate and collectively decide they don't want to miss out locking in peak rates and they stop sitting on their hands and become buyers in the upcoming auctions.  


> Hopefully we actually get long term benefits from our spending 

The benefit we've already had - albeit mostly unrecognized - is in the form of the greatest jobs economy in 75 years, and getting better.  It also comes in how we have somehow navigated the previous administration printing 40% of the US dollars in existence with what has been basically a miraculously low 4-5% inflation and no extra-large depression.  And through the next years, we'll have the benefits that come from bolstering our tech sector andand our manufacturing and production and green jobs economy, and restoring some of our crumbling infrastructure and moving back a bit on our dependence on foreign aspects.",257

"Of course you don’t base all your trading decisions on P/E. It’s a figure to look at and take into consideration, but it’s just one of many factors.

I personally hate it when people categorize companies in growth and non-growth companies. That’s wrong thinking as well. There are phases of growth for many good companies, and the market does like to exaggerate in the short-term. This lets a lot of people fall into a trap: they see a company has higher-than-usual growth, and they expect, perhaps rightly so, that growth to continue. Problem is they expect it to continue indefinitely, which is just absurd. 

No company can grow 40-50% forever. For a few years, sure, but if we are talking 10-20 years, or longer, such a growth is impossible, especially for companies that are already big. Since the market likes to exaggerate it prices in quite a bit of that strong short-term growth, leading to subpar results for those investors expecting to benefit from that excessive growth. Such short-term strategies are therefore of limited success.

A good example for this is TSLA. In 2021 and 2022, you saw a lot of people being convinced it will keep growing 40-50% for the next 10+ years, which is absurd for a company of that size. A month or two ago they conceded they cannot keep up that level of growth… which surprised nobody with the least bit of common sense. Does this make TSLA a bad investment? Not necessarily, but buying into the hype isn’t a good long-term strategy. If you bought the dip in mid 2022 at around 225, you’d be up around 10% today, significantly less than the overall market, at a much higher stress level.

The same goes for NVDA today. AI is hyped a lot, NVDA is growing massively, and they might continue growing like that for a few years. But a lot of that growth is priced in already, and eventually things will cool down, and their growth will slow down. Does that mean they won’t go up long-term? Of course not, but it doesn’t make it too likely they will outperform the market in the long run, either. Buying NVDA as a long-term investment is taking a lot of risk, compared to the potential upside. 

If you’re looking at a shorter time frame, a few years or so, valuation of companies becomes much less important, and investments are much more speculative. If you find an edge there, good for you, but you're not valuating the company, you're speculating.

In conclusion ""high growth"" isn't a property of a company, it's a short-term effect that only has limited effect on the long-term valuation of a company.",259
"For forward PE, you have the same problem as PE. If you only look at forward PE you could assume the company is cheap and then it does not deliver on the projected earnings and you are a fool.

You should base your investments on many different metrics and use different metrics for different companies. Look at their moat, their management and the secular trends in their industry",259
Pe is just a single metric and doesn’t work well to value a number or different types of businesses. I had a long argument with someone a little while back about why it makes no sense to use pe to value a reit. He was unyielding.,259
PE is a metric of importance in all companies and due diligence. Buts it’s a piece of the puzzle and that puzzle piece size varies.,259
"I'll add to this and say that this only applies to companies with optimised earnings.

A problem with growth companies is that they often don't have optimised GAAP earnings (or earnings at all) – CRM and AMZN are a good example of a companies like this.

If a company is not currently optimising its profit margins then evaluating the business based on its current profitability is pointless even if you adjust for growth. Instead you must make assumptions about what optimised profit margins might look like and apply whatever future growth rate you believe is achievable on top of this.

In general a high trailing PE should just prompt you to do more research. To assume the market is wrong and that you're outsmarting the market because high PE = bad is obviously a very arrogant and likely flawed way to approach investing.

Finally even low PEs can be misleading. For example, SHOP a year or so back had a very reasonable PE given its growth rate (around 30 IIRC). However, this was almost entirely because they posted a large jump in GAAP profits in 2022 from an unrealized gain in their Affirm investment. It was something that really should have been ignored entirely, but a lot of investors saw the reasonable PE and great growth and thought they were buying a bargain. The truth was far more complicated.",259
You shouldn’t be using one metric to value a company period. P/E is still important but its not the end all be all.,259
Forward PE and PEG are useless for growth stocks who aren’t producing profits yet. Better to look at free cash flow and free cash flow growth.,259
"Yes Nvidia is one of the most glaring examples on this forum. A forward PE of 25 and a growth of 8% quarterly growth (that's 36% if compounded and sustained for a year) is actually not bad on fundamentals at all although i'll acknowledge risks in whether this can be sustained or not. 

Yet every thread with such companies has upvoted posts complaining about a high total valuation or a high PE in isolation as if that's a reason to short a stock. Then there's subsequent posts about surprise when the stock doesn't move the way they thought it would given that poor effort at valuation.

Obviously, based on what you have provided, you're likely 18 or close to it. Buying and trading stocks is not investing. Investing starts with your self and then your financial independence.

I can give you a stock like $AMD and you may even double your money in six months, sell the stock, and go buy yourself a video game. That's not investing. You want to be in it for the long game. I'm talking 10-30 years.

Once you're regularly generating income and have more than $100 to 'invest,' I would start out with an S&P 500 etf with a low expense ratio: $SPLG is a great example. 40% of my portfolio is SPLG and FXAIX. I started buying in 2010. Then you hold it for a long time.

In addition, do NOT open a margin account. This allows you to lose more than you have. Open a cash account. If you like to leverage, you can try the riskier 2x or 3x leveraged ETF's, assigning a portion of your total contributions using the 80/20 rule.

The basic principal that you've stated is correct. The lower expense ratio for an S&P 500 tracking etf will benefit you more in the long run. The truth as to why I picked SPLG over SPY so many years ago was that I could afford more whole shares of SPLG when fractional shares weren't really a thing. 

The big head answer has more to do with the AUM or assets under management available to SPY, which is in the billions. Thus giving SPY a greater options market. But I don't invest in options with S&P 500 trackers because it goes against why I hold the S&P 500 in the first place.

Going through a quick skim of their filings, it looks like they because trading on TSX on 6/7/2023, which tells me that considering they had their initial offering less than 6 months ago, another public offering would either (a) completely tank their share price (b) possibly rules on the Canadian exchange the make it hard / impossible to offer more shares within such a short time period from IPO or (c) a combination of both.

>ut from what Ive looked up, it also seems that it will add to the total shared outstanding, bringing the price down.

You're correct, total shares outstanding will increase, but I think you need to dig deeper into the details beyond share dilution - mainly, what is Foran using this new capital **to do**? Again, looking at the IR section of their website, it looks like these guys have just [one property that they're planning to produce from](https://imgur.com/a/i1FUg6J) in Saskatchewan, McIlvenna Bay Project.

TL;DR - this isn't a major red flag or indicate something that you shouldn't already know (e.g. that this is a risky mining project that hasn't started production who's cash flows are tied to a volatile commodity market that may not be there when they **actually** start selling their product into the market). 


At the end of the day, I feel like this investment thesis really comes down to two factors: (1) how you feel about the Canadian metals commodity market for the next 3 - 5 years and (2) your take on the geology and how that affects go-forward capex, opex profile once production starts, and whether or not the market is being overly punitive on the transportation costs involved moving tons from remote areas of Canada to a liquid physical metals settlement point / market.",261

>  Cramer said to go all in on that stock and the Chinese government pulled it soon after. No, I do inverse Cramer

Sigh. Just to correct this piece of daily Cramer hate and disinformation...

While he *did* give it a strong recommendation when it had a sharp pullback to a cheaper price, he made a monumental and very public reversal 24 hours later at the first whiff of government tampering.

He loudly notified people across every channel, and scrapped his mad money episode for the day to create a new one focused on why people should sell DIDI immediately.  And he went further: warning people to sell EVERY China stock in existence.

He apologized for his brief endorsement of DIDI, and gave detailed explanations for the original call and the subsequent change. 

He then spent a portion of every broadcast for the next several months reminding people of his strongest possible warning ""sell EVERY China stock"".

He had to reinforce this hundreds of times, as Chinese stocks fell and the prices started to look more compelling.  He reiterated, saying however much they had fallen, they definitely be falling further.  And he was right.

If you would have listened to him, you would have sold DIDI at $14, about 500% up from current levels.  

Then, like now, witting and unwitting cranks bashed Cramer for his ""sell all China stocks"" call.  After all, they were smugly enjoying their $330 BABA shares and all the rest China memes. 

But their antagonistic hubris was quickly exposed as literally every big China stock collapsed not long after.  BABA today is down 78% from Cramer's first warning.  DIDI got delisted as did LUCKIN.  The whole China stock sector has been demolished.

It's not surprising you left out 99.99999% of the story in your false claim that you ""inverse Cramer"".

"People been cutting cords since forever.

Two things can be true,

1. Less people are paying for cable
2. Less people are paying for cable, but it doesn’t really matter. Why?

1. Streaming prices are stupid now. HBO + Hulu + Netflix will cost you as much as cable without all you get on cable

2. Sports. Regional sports. College sports. You need cable for that, for now.

3. Some people in rural areas have low access to internet but have access to cable, weird but true.

If that will occur, it's not going to be a good time for WBD (who just paid Guy Fieri $100M) either. Pure play legacy media is not a good business: there's better places to be when times are good, you don't want to be near it when times even start to go South and the only appeal is to try and play a recovery but even that requires calling a bottom which people have tried to do on here with these names for a while now - the interest in WBD post spin was bizarre imo, down 56% in about a year and a half since - and it hasn't gone well.",265

"Bad financials. A cursory glance shows that while revenue grow is strong, profitability is nonexistent and not trending upward. 20% of their assets are goodwill, which from a company that sells charging services, seems too high. Also, negative cash flow from operations, and CFO > EBIT can be a warning sign of potential overstatement or non-sustainability and of operating income or net income. Even if not, income statement (excluding revenues), balance sheet, and cash flows all look bad.",268
"Two issues with chargepoint.

 First is that we’re in a high rate environment and they’re massively unprofitable. This makes it incredibly hard for them to acquire funding, so any cash they get from here on out is through massive dilution to shareholders.

Second issue is that Tesla is in the early stages of dominating the entire EV charging industry. They’ve convinced basically every auto brand in North America to switch to their tesla chargers. This means that to use chargepoint you either need to hassle around with an adaptor or chargepoint needs to spend billions to upgrade all their chargers to NACS. 

Bonus reason chargepoint sucks is their business model. They have a tiny margin on their cloud business, and the majority of revenue comes from selling or repairing the charging stations to customers. Compare this to tesla, who gets paid every single time someone uses their supercharger. 

Not every company down 95% is like amazon in 2000. Most are like Pets.co in 2000",268

"Thank you so much for this information.  

I feel a bit relieved after learning that I will never lose this loss. 

To confirm my understanding. 
The new RSUs vested on 11/15 got the cost basis adjusted. But that was also sold by me. So the loss is realized but again this is ruled by wash sale again correct?

Which means the lossses will propagate to some other share. But my question is. I do not own any shares at this point. (Since everything was sold)

In this case, Do the losses propagate to the future RSU that ll vest in the next vesting cycle? (Next year).

Really appreciate the help here my friend.",269
">To confirm my understanding. The new RSUs vested on 11/15 got the cost basis adjusted. But that was also sold by me. So the loss is realized but again this is ruled by wash sale again correct?

No, this isn't a wash sale because you did not buy any shares after. You just realized the disallowed loss, it's all done.",269
"Oh I see. I understand now.

So the losses that I was initially intending to realize (from RSUs vested long time ago) is propagated to the RSUs vested on 11/15. Because of wash rule

But when RSUs vested on 11/15 was sold also. All the losses that propagated is essentially realized. 

Then in the end, I can use all of these losses to credit against capital gains ? And $3000 off income? 

Am I on the same page here? This is how I understood it. 

Thanks again!!",269
"Yes that's correct.

And yes, all capital gains and losses cancel each other. If you end up with net capital losses, $3k gets applied to ordinary income and whatever is left is carried over to next year and so on.",269

I was kicking myself in the head yesterday for not holding on to the RSUs that sold with big losses. (Since I thought those losses would be evaporated and not used to credit against capital gains for this year.) but it looks like my plan would still work where these losses will credit against my capital gains for this year.

I think they initially said 2.3% bigger than any other black friday, later revised it down but when inflation is running 9% youd expect ifthe same people went out and bought the same things sales should be a minimum 9% bigger so them being 2.3% bigger actually means its a 6.7% loss over the previous year.",270

"[Some Mag 7 math: the weighted average forward P/E ratio of Mag 7 companies is about 32.](https://i.imgur.com/XASJ1kf.png)

I took forward P/E ratios from Koyfin. Weight is given by relative weight in Mag 7, i.e., META is 2% of S&P 500, the Mag 7 is 28.8% of S&P 500, hence META's weight is 2/28.8 = 6.8%. 

You can judge for yourself if that's appropriate or not for some of the highest quality companies in the world. There were some graphs going around Twitter literally taking the raw average of the P/Es, as in, putting equal weight on the out-dated >100 P/E ratios it used for NVDA or TSLA and the 20-30 P/E ratios from e.g. META.

Sounds like a compelling reason to avoid legacy automakers. Being heavily capital intensive is bad in that it means lots of money is forced to go into reinvestment rather than shareholder returns. But it also means high barriers to entry. Anyone have some good examples of extremely capital intensive businesses with great long term returns?

""[The market portfolio](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2978509)"" is a theoretical bundle of investments that includes every type of asset available in the investment universe, with each asset weighted in proportion to its total presence in the market. The expected return of a market portfolio is identical to the expected return of the market as a whole.

The average weight in the market portfolio is 50.8% for equities broad, 3.3% for real estate, 15.1% for nongovernment bonds, 28.6% for government bonds broad, and 2.2% for commodities. These weights are averaged throughout the sample period from 1959 - 2017.

During the sample period the market portfolio realized a compounded real return in U.S. dollars of 4.45%, with a standard deviation of annual returns of 11.2%. The compounded excess return was 3.39%.

Edit: According to [Harry Markowitz](https://sites.math.washington.edu/~burke/crs/408/fin-proj/mark1.pdf) 'the market portfolio' is theoretically 'the mean variance portfolio'.

The point of buying an index like the S&P500 is that we can't pick in advance the handful of stocks that will make most of the gains. So we cast a wide net and catch the big fish. But the S&P500 is only large cap US stocks, there's no chance of catching the international big fish. Owning US companies does nothing for you if or when a non-US stock goes up. 

US companies getting revenue from, let's say China, won't go up in value if the Chinese stock market goes up. You have to own that market to get the benefits of a Chinese stock market rally.

Owning US companies getting revenues from overseas is not the same as owning non-US companies.

And for those who are going to reply with past performance. Looking at past performance of US and international equities doesn't predict the future and doesn't consider the positive effect of rebalancing. Just looking at the past two or three decades is recency bias anyway.",275

"About 40% of S&P revenues are earned internationally so the S&P is arguably already globally diversified.

Edit: many good comments below are pointing out that global revenues are not sufficient global diversification and I agree. My comment should be rephrased to the S&P “is at least globally diverse in its revenues.” It is not sufficiently globally diverse for the investor who wants complete diversification. For my money, GCOW or VXUS are good options.",275

Vanguard has a few papers that collectively point to that argument being bad. I don't know if Vanguard is right or not but their work doesn't align with the commonly held notion that the US index is unto itself globally diversified in ways that term is often used by investors.,275
"Well the main question OP asked is what is 'the market'. That is the academically backed response to that specific question. 

To answer your question, yes the 60/40 briefly outperforms 100% equities during crashes due to interest rates falling thus bond prices rising. But on average over a long period of time 100% equities will beat 'the market'. 

The important bit was at the bottom of my response. You are getting the best return **for the risk taken** when utilizing the market portfolio. It maximizes expected return for a given level of risk. It's not about maximizing total return in general. 

100% equities means higher risk thus higher return, but this doesn't mean your risk/return ratio itself is 'optimal'.",275

These drugs might work wonders for the right people but I still think there's no such thing as a free lunch. Losing a bunch of weight just by getting a shot is going to cost you something, sooner or later.",277
These drugs greatly lower the appetite and potentially have disastrous consequences for fast food and snack companies if they are not able to pivot. Assuming these drugs become more widely available.,277
"I agree - behavioral change is the most healthy, sustainable way of losing weight. 

BUT, when almost 80% of the country are overweight/obese and projected over 90% within our generation, we just need to admit white-knuckling the obesity epidemic has failed on a societal level. Anyone holding out hope the vast majority of fat people here can or will change their behavior is deluding themselves into a public health crisis.  

My optimist take is that these drugs will be used similarly the way antidepressant largely are - a *temporary* chemical intervention to a dysfunction in the brain which medical practitioners can use as a baseline to break out of a rut and then followup with healthier, sustainable practices while weaning them off.",277
"You must be measuring from the bottom of the covid dip. I'm not sure this is the best way to measure returns as that was a moment of extreme panic and, looking back, a huge over reaction. 

Pre-covid the S&P was around 3400, and almost 4 years later is now at around 4550. So about a 30% increase in just under 4 years. That's about average long term returns.

"Okay if things were still priced in gold, none of that would have happened. What you watched after COVID was a lot of money being pushed into the system. Assets are going to adjust higher. As the Fed backs off of being so restrictive, the economy is still growing, people are still moving forward, assets move higher so 5,000 by next year, 100% realistic. Is there likely to be some kind of 10 to 15% correction along the way where people start getting worried about growth? Absolutely. Can you time that? Probably not",278

- Rates exist now (aka I can get 5.5% in cash to park my money, in other words, there are options other than the stock market for investors, which can lead to outflows that wouldn’t have happened in the past).

Some other lesser reasons to be bearish:
- China may shit the bed. Story dropped of their shadow bank sector being “unable to pay debts”, as they still deal with housing crisis/evergrande. 2nd largest economy. 
- Reddit, as evidenced by this thread, is very bullish… apparently they have figured out the market direction for 5 years, it’s not priced in, and it’s the same as the 2010s /s

"Economists think of the world linearly. The fed wants to get cpi down to 2% and then re-evaluate. Last time they wanted to get cpi up to 2% and we hit 9%. So why am I bearish? Because nonlinearity. 

In honesty, I’m neutral. This entire thing has been gamified. It is a casino. The risk to reward is not worth it. I’d rather wait it out, be sidelined, find the specific companies I like, and then trade this market range. 

Having 25% of the portfolio in 5%+ yield treasuries puts me at ease. If we’re getting rate cuts, they’ll appreciate anyways and I can sell and reinvest in equities. 

If we have a confirmed bull market, I’ll just simply go all in and miss a bit of the initial rally.

What do people like about DCU?

"So the cheaper plans are term insurance, which you also may need in far greater amounts, especially if you have dependents.  This doesn't replace that, even if you keep it.

And yes, it was probably a crappy deal at the time.  Now though?  Most of the crappiness has already been absorbed.  $125/yr 36 years ago is far more than $125 now.  Then again, so was the death benefit.

$10/mo?  I think i'd just let that ride.  Unlike term insurance policies (literally 99% expire before death), whole life WILL pay out.  Think of it this way.  Another 50 years of payments is only $6K in exchange for a $25K death benefit.  Not a ton of money, but at least someone will have enough to put you in the ground and throw a nice party.",294
"Since you didn't pay for the first ~30 years, you should keep it. At some point it will most likely pay for itself. Investing may give you better returns over time, but if you die early, the life insurance will be worth more. If you lose your investments or suffer serious health issues that deplete your funds, this policy will help with final expenses.",294
"Honestly just keep it. 10/month for 25k later on is worth it. Besides, getting out of it or cashing it in will be more complicated and far less incentivizing.",294
Most of the comments here are ignoring that the policy death benefit is likely to grow from $25k as well. Have the insurance company run an in force illustration with rate of return ledger and you can evaluate how the death benefit and cash value are projected to perform.,294
"
Info:
1) how old are you?
2) how is your health? If you are uninsurable or have a health condition? A new policy would be more expensive in general if you have poor health. 
3) what is the purpose of the insurance? If you died today, who would be impacted? 

A policy like this is good for burial costs or the bequeath to someone. Burial costs are something you will have regardless of your age of death. Term insurance is GREAT for insuring debts because at some point you will be debt-free and not need the insurance any longer. 

My suggestion is to keep it and layer additional term insurance on top of it to cover things like liabilities and loss of income to anyone counting on you. 

This policy in and of itself probably isn’t enough coverage, but even if it is, it’s inexpensive. If you don’t want to pay for it, You could ask the insurance company to change how the dividends are being allocated to have them go towards premium, instead of increasing the death benefit. Also the death benefit is tax-free to your beneficiaries.",294
"The fact is whole life plans are a bad deal, but if you have a whole life plan that was made a long time ago, it's not necessarily a bad deal to keep it, all the money put into it thus far is gone, nothing changes that.  Newer life insurance plans have much higher premiums than 30 year old ones.  Not only because you are older but the actuarial tables are different, And it's guaranteed.  if you could get a guaranteed 6% return on the same money for 40 years that's the break even point.

and you might be able to tap into it for a loan if times get really tough.

Again, don't buy a whole life plan, but if you have one, don't necessarily think you should cancel because you shouldn't have gotten it in the first place, just depends on the policy.",294
"What other amounts do you have? I have 2x my salary for no cost through my employer, so we cashed out a small whole life my mom had started when I was a kid as the payout was pretty insignificant and despite the premium and the cash value being fairly low, I saw a better use for the money now since anyone who needs to be covered would be covered by my work policy.",294
"Sell it.

Intuition says it’s much money, but every year it’s cheap, and hey, $25k to leave to your family when you die. Why not? But intuition is not good at exponents over long periods of time.

If your life expectancy now is about 40 years, putting $125 a year into the stock market instead at a lower than historical average 9% gives you $42,000 over the next four decades. If you make it 50 years, you’d have over $100,000. Yes, with long term capital gains taxes owed… unless you treat it like insurance and it’s an estate, in which case taxes are unlikely.

Given the speed of growth so far, I very much doubt the life insurance will keep pace. So I would sell it and invest instead.",294
"It’s okay.  
The math on this is just kinda ‘meh’.

"Except that death benefit is, by actuarial tables, worth less than investing even that small premium over the next four to five decades",294
"""Most of the crappiness"" may have already been absorbed, but there's still more than enough crappiness to go around. For $10/month, a 36-year-old should be getting $150k in insurance (or should be paying $1.50 a month for 25k in insurance, if you want to look at it that way).

This is the same shell game that ALWAYS gets played with whole life. When it's pointed out that whole life is way-too-expensive insurance, they say ""but it's actually an investment"". When you point out that your investment would grow to a far larger amount if you invested it yourself, they say ""but it's actually insurance"". 

If you buy term and invest the savings, you get the best of both worlds. The fact that the OP is insured for a relatively small amount just means that you're flushing less money down the toilet each year, but the principle still applies. Get term insurance FIRST, then cash out and invest the cash value. Your new investment will grow faster than the cash value would have, and you'll have insurance if you need it.

And I'd *definitely* take the 6k spread out over 50 years over 25k in 50 years. The 6k is worth far more.",294
"No guarantee that op is around another 4-5 decades. If he passes earlier, the death benefit could be much greater than whatever was invested otherwise from now to then",294
"If OP needs guaranteed money, they should get term insurance.

If they want to leave an inheritance, or have more money later, they’re more likely to come out ahead by canceling this policy and investing.

It’s possible to come out ahead with this policy, but it’s less likely. It’s also possible to come out ahead by buying lotto tickets, but you shouldn’t do that because the odds are against you.",294
"You’re seriously advocating that OP abandon a 25k death benefit that requires a $125 *annual* contribution to take a $1000 payout and invest that and the contribution instead. You need more than 33 years at 7% return to meet that, and the return isn’t guaranteed. 

It’s not lotto odds. 33 years is a long time.",294
"Except that 25k of term life insurance would cost around $1.50/month (not that you'd bother getting such a small amount). For $10 a month, a 36-year-old should be getting closer to $150k in insurance, not $25k. So you need to add the savings on insurance premiums into the equation.",294
"Right now hysas are paying about 5%, which is pretty tough to beat for a safe investment. One thing to consider might be bonds or CDs to lock in that rate for longer, since an hysa rate can change.

Personally, in that situation I'd likely increase retirement contributions. Definitely may sure you're getting any match, and consider an IRA. If you're also saving up for a first home, you might want to look into rules on borrowing from your 401k for the down payment. You have to pay it back with interest, but you pay the interest back into your own retirement account.",295
"That's a good chunk of savings on a 50k salary, keep it up! 
For me, I like having access to cash when I need it, so I would keep building the savings. You are right about it being your independence. Next time you need a car, for example, you can pay cash for it like a boss and not pay any interest on it. 
I guess one suggestion would be to open a Roth IRA and max that out every year in addition to your 401k contributions. The cash savings might suffer a little because of that but long term it's worth it.",295

I recommend a 6-month EF based on market prices in your area, but anything beyond that can be moved to your house fund. But if your house goal is within 2-3 years *that* money ~~should~~ ***shouldn't*** be invested anyway — stick to HYSA, MMF, CDs.

I go on weekend vacations every other month because I live in a beautiful place.

My job is pretty stable, I don’t think I would lose it. I just live in an area where I don’t speak the dominant language so I rely on remote work. I also have about a decade of experience serving so I could work tourism or a restaurant. That’s an option now but I would like to move somewhere a bit more remote where those jobs don’t exist.",295

Gotcha. You definitely don't need 18 months EF, I would say 6 months (maybe go 9 just in case you end up needing to rent solo), but everything above that can definitely go elsewhere. 

And your house DP fund doesn't literally need to be DP only, it can be your generic ""house fund"" that is both DP and EF padding as your regular EF will need to be increased once you buy. Yeah, it's just shifting around the buckets but it gives you a little more freedom to lock up that money short/medium term with either CDs, rate chasing, or bank bonuses.

3. Yes but don’t go hog wild. A good place to start is the bank you’re already with; they will see that you’re a student and probably extend you a card with a very low limit. Get used to charging small amounts and paying them off on time.

And try not to take out more student loans than that average new salary is! Graduate on time, take summer classes if and when necessary, GET INTERNSHIPS if at all possible.",297
"Regarding the loans - take out as little as you can. It’s easy now to take out an extra $5k or $10k per year. But if you end up spending that on eating out or non-essentials, then you’re just racking up a lot of extra loans. You won’t think it’s all that much now, but when you have to pay it back, it hurts. Use loans for your education, but use your working income for living and fun stuff as much as you can. Live with roommates to keep costs down on rent/utilities.

It’s a good idea to make a budget. Track your spending for a few months, and see exactly where your money is going. You might think you’re spending $100/month on restaurants, but it could really be $300. Until you track it, you won’t really know. Once you’re tracking it, you can make a budget and it’s easier to force yourself to keep to the budget. Figure out how much you make per month and how much you feel comfortable spending. Remember, if you can take out fewer loans, your future self will thank you. It can be hard when your friends all go out to lunch or dinner and you want to join - but if you have a budget, you can decide whether you really have the money to do so that month. Alternatively, you will learn to be cheap eating at home all month so that when those dinners happen, you have room in the budget for it. You don’t want to miss out on everything - college can be a wonderful experience, it’s a special time of life and you won’t get to live like that again. But just try to keep the spending in moderation and learn good saving/spending habits. 

If you want a credit card, it’s good to build credit, but be very careful. Ideally in your situation you want to maybe put your Netflix subscription on it, pay it monthly, and otherwise leave it alone. Do not keep a balance on it. Credit cards are easy to get as a college student but remember - it’s NOT free money. Just because you have a $3k credit limit doesn’t mean you have $3k to spend. Just use it to build credit and as an absolute last resort in the event of emergency.",297
Do not start saving for retirement until you have a full-time job after college.

Unless you are making a ton of money I wouldn't worry about this until you got a steady job with a 401k. That is how most people will get into retirement. 

What you need to focus on is living. Family then friends. 

Life will present to you certain things that can only be bought in the opportunity that presents itself do not lose things over fear of money but at the same time don't go burning all your money on stupid shit ether.",297
"If you're responsible with your purchases, which I assume you are just by nature of the fact that you made this post, I highly recommend getting a credit card. Treat it like a debit card, meaning only buy something if you could immediately pay it off in full and still afford it, then make sure you pay it off every month. Some people set up a monthly auto-pay, I prefer to pay mine off manually a few times a month, just to make sure I'm keeping tabs on my spending. NEVER use a credit card as a loan to buy something you can't afford in the moment. Their high interest rates will financially ruin you.

The biggest factors for your credit score are credit utilization and age of credit. The former is easy to keep low if you pay it off multiple times a month. The latter takes time (like 5 years to be considered ""good""). So if you start now, by the time you graduate, you'll be way ahead of most people your age and you'll thank yourself when you need to buy your next car in your 20s.

For beginners, I highly recommend the Citi Double Cash card, with no annual fee and a flat 2% cash back on every purchase. So you don't need to worry about miles or spending categories. You just spend like you normally would and get to surprise yourself with an extra $1-200 in free money every year.

Just try to avoid any branded cards like an Amazon card or an Apple Card, since their rewards are more niche, and would serve better as a secondary card, which you aren't ready for.",297

"Getting an internship (early) is so lucrative to secure better opportunities post-undergrad. Even starting early in your college career doing a part time or unpaid internship will be worth it in securing a better role. Do whatever you can to get experience on your resume that you can talk about. Could even lead to a part time job while you finish school which would likely pay far more then any other job your qualified for. Also definitely limit the loans you take out, do whatever you can to make enough to get by, and pay your tuition/room and board. This will be the biggest thing to ensure you don’t have insane amounts of debt and a huge payment when you start your “adult” life.",297

"2 years ago I quit using H that took me to pretty much rock bottom after 9 using. Lost car, house, pretty much every possession I had except a small bag of clothes. Credit was done. How I proceeded. #1 got a bicycle. Is it cool no is it fun no is it super cheap and gets you from home to work yes. #2 save money. Go out to eat fuck that 50 cent noodles. Get a cheap hobby drawing bird watching who cares just stack savings. #3 buy a beater. You save up 1500-3 grand now u search Facebook marketplace and other apps for cars. No not a Jeep Compass. Or any Jeep for that matter my friend. I’m talking the basics here accords, civics, uhhh I don’t think I’d go with anything else old and high mileage but do your research. My 01 accord with over 300K that I got for 1400 is a tank. Then just keep up with steps #2 and once you get over 5K in your account don’t worry banks will be lining up to give you credit again and you can build up once again and make irresponsible financial decisions. Now this isn’t what you should do this is just advice if you end up in that situation. Maybe someone on here can prevent the repo and all that. And don’t congratulate my sobriety I relapsed last spring. But hey we can rebuild lol good luck",298
"Don't give it over. You don't save anything by doing that. They will auction it off for pennies, then put that money towards your loan. You will still owe the balance of it and have no car. 

The dealership is lying to you. They wont' roll over a defaulted loan into a new car. 

You need to figure out how to get that $1,100 to stop the repo. Otherwise your ship is just sunk, be that if you wait for them to come pick her up or if you hand her over voluntarily. You will be without a car. 

What other bills do you have? What is taking priority away form your car payment? Rent is the only thing that should take priority over your car payment at this time, since you need your home first and foremost. But everything else, it should be able to wait until you get back into your job at the end of the month and you can catch up easier. On things that cannot be repoed.",298
"Talk to the bank. Since you're starting work again, they would rather keep you in the loan than pop the car. They loaned you the money with the desire to get 60 payments from you. Having to repo the car hurts them too. Yes, they will sue you for the balance, but that's just the payoff balance so to speak. They still lose out on the total of the payments they would have received had you taken the loan to term. So long story short, they don't want to repo it if there is a light at the end of your tunnel, which it sounds like there is. Call them",298
"Every time I hear one of these common stories about needing under $2000, I wonder, why not put it on a credit card?  Are they that hard to get now?  It isn't a great solution but it beats losing the car and a way to make the money needed to keep the car.   Once you lose a car, you are in a very deep hole that makes it hard to make enough to get out.  But dump that on the credit card and it is still a hole but not that deep.",298
I'd just drive it for now. There's a shortage of repo drivers and some banks aren't being aggressive on doing it and focusing on big ticket cars.,298
"Is the lien holder Chrysler? If so, I would call back and ask to speak to a manager and see if they'll defer a month or two of payments which would essentially get you up to speed.  As others have already stated, the bank wants you to continue to pay this loan, and it is in their best interest to resolve this with you without the repo.",298
"Hey, give yourself some credit. Yes you relapsed, but holy shit you got yourself out, AGAIN! That’s a huge accomplishment! I’m extremely proud of you!",298
"The dealership might roll him over into a shipbox at a 22% interest rate. 

This is more of an emergency how does OP get $1500 together like right now.

"Just a word of advice:  Repo people cannot open / enter your garage / gated property.  They also cannot move other cars to get yours.

Put a camera on your property and any type of locked gate or garage will keep it from being repossessed at your home or you’ll have a lawsuit that’ll pay it off for you.

When going to work, just don’t risk it.  Take the bus for now.  Hold that car hostage until you have the money.  Your credit is already hit and you’ll likely still owe the bank a shitload of money, as another poster said, they will sell it for pennies, you will still owe the bank the remainder of the balance.",298
"Thank you, I discovered that at the meeting with the dealership today. He essentially tried to get me to grab a co-signer and buy a brand new ford that I could roll the negative equity into and then “what happens to the Jeep happens”, which wasn’t a solution for me. I’m currently doing every side job I can scrape up, so I’m hoping I can be fast enough. My other bills are rent and splitting basic utilities, groceries, and in a normal month helping my fiancé pay his bills but I haven’t been doing that so far. It’s mostly been major life events that have taken their toll on my bank account in a short time span. On top of funeral stuff our dog also had to have emergency surgery so I feel like life really crashed down on me, which wouldn’t be a problem if I didnt have such poor life planning. I paid around 55 days late along with all of my other bills and didn’t notice that the car was reversed until day 60. I had to transfer literally $10 to pay it again but they said at 60 days they had a repo pending put on my account just hours before I called. I paid rent again but I’m about 70% of the way to my past due to get the repo off my back. It seems like just putting my nose to the grindstone will be the only reasonable solution. Thanks for taking the time to reply!",298

"Ditto. Don’t diminish your accomplishments, u/MortalKombatSFX",298

I have experience in a lot of side hustles thankfully so I’ve just been putting sleep to the side and working for hours to get this behind me. It is a lousy situation but it’s taught me the importance of saving regularly at the very least so there’s that. Also if I can hold down the compass until I start back to my full time job I’m going to aggressively pay it down to get out from under it and buy a car in cash",298
"This is a good idea actually, I didn’t consider it. I do have a garage and I can drive my fiancés car when needed or we can carpool. I’ll make some space in there tonight. I didn’t know they couldn’t have me open my garage!",298
"Make sure you get camera coverage.  Repo people are ruthless.  It’s illegal for them to break into your garage but some will still do it.  I’d put a cheap camera that you can buy off Amazon that syncs to a cloud storage inside your garage hidden with a clear view of whoever enters the vehicle.

If you don’t have camera footage they can say you left your garage door open and then it’s your word vs theirs.

If you get camera evidence it’s an easy win in court that will solve your temporary financial problems.  Not typically a fan of lawsuit chasing but I am a huge fan of people’s inherent rights.",298
"I would recommend asking the hospital where you received treatment about Charity Care. If your income is low enough and you qualify, it is possible Charity Care may lower the amount you owe significantly or even eliminate the debt entirely.",299
"I will mimic what /u/Alternative-Mall5228 said. Go to the hospital and inquire about charity care. Got into a automobile accident which I was a passenger in my friends car(long story, he had no insurance on the car). My bill from the hospital was about $11kUSD, this was back in 2004. I was only 19 and worked at wendy's for $5.55/hr. Applied for charity care at the hospital that ""serviced"" me and debt was erased within a few weeks. $19kUSD is close to the federal minimum wage, I'm sure charity care will take care of you. Good luck and keep up updated.",299
"Obviously your ""treatment"" did not cost that much.
 Hospitals apply insane rates when you have no insurance. 

I also had a bike accident. It was not as bad as you (I did have a sprained ankle but I was able to ride the bike back home without shifter lever and a bent handlebar) but because I was over 65 the medical center where I walked in (my wife drove me) did not want to see me and sent me to the ER. The ER applied the ""senior"" protocol with multiple MRIs. My bike insurance was only for liability but the hospital insisted on filing with it instead of my health insurance. The bike insurance company declined it of course so the hospital presented me with a $63,000 bill. I told them to talk to my health insurance and after they did and applied ""the insurance rates"", the bill came down to $6,000, of which I had to pay 15% or $900, the insurance paying the difference.

So simply because I had insurance, the hospital said that it cost them not even 10% of what they wanted me to pay initially. There is no doubt that they still made money with $6k.

Talk to the hospital and explain your situation before they send it to collection. You might be able to get a significant discount and a payment plan you can afford. Once it goes to collection, your options will be more limited.

Bankruptcy is an option but it will mess your life for a long time, so I suggest you try to avoid it.",299

Do you mean Medicaid? There is retro active Medicaid depending on the state. Why did they say you can't apply? That doesn't make any sense. Who told you that?,299
"Yeah, I don't think coverage can be retroactively applied after the accident anyways. I imagine you don't have bike insurance either - those sometimes have 'med pay' that can be put toward medical expenses from accidents.

[I would watch this YouTube video before you do anything](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trc0Fugi_8c), but based on what I'm reading, you would be a good candidate for what's known as a 'no-asset' Chapter 7 bankruptcy. 

The other option would be to call the hospital (which you should do anyways to confirm the Charity Care status) and ask to be set up on an income-based payment plan. 

Based on your income, I could see them putting you on a very low cost monthly payment plan. Granted, this would take *forever* to pay off, but that's something you'd have to weigh going forward. Decide whether it's worth it to take the credit hit from bankruptcy or get stuck with a monthly payment that won't ever really go away (unless you come into a lot of money). 

If the hospital doesn't want to play ball and they insist you pay a monthly amount that would drown you, then bankruptcy becomes the easy call.",299

"Yes, you shop for a new insurer. In the unlikely situation that you cannot find someone to ensure you, you will go with the California fair plan. It is costly, but it gives you insurance, and meets the requirement for most mortgages.

I think you can call the car company whoever you owe the payments to and explain your situation just as you have now. I’m sure they could give you an extension maybe change the date.

"Do you have a credit card? Wells Fargo has 0% APR balance transfer, chase and discover card and few others. 
If so, get a balance transfer of 5k to keep you afloat.  Then you can have that balance transfer go directly to your bank account and you can use that money to make minimum payments back to your credit card and make payments to your car and insurance. You can also pay your insurance using PayPal credit and not pay interest on it for 6 months. 0% Apr into credit card is better. 

The key is to use this money to keep you a float not to buy lavish items or to go out to dinner. 

All new expenses can go on a 0% APR credit card if there is an emergency. You have to pay all of this money back within 12-15 months but it should help you finish school hopefully. 

Lastly you can apply for a student loan maybe to keep you a float for cosmetology school? If they offer that? But again don’t take on more than 5k. Or more than what you need. This is how I put myself through school and every summer I’d make the 5k back to my credit cards back.

"What percentage of the home price is your $30K?

Given 7% mortgage interest rates and PMI on top of that if not 20%, I think I'd sell enough to put down at least 20%.  If you are like me, you started that brokerage account back when you knew you wanted to save for and eventually buy a house, just no time soon.  That time is now here.",305

"If you’re covered by a retirement plan at work, you can’t deduct traditional contributions. So there’s no reason to not do a backdoor roth

Roth always wins vs nondeductible traditional",306
"Yea, the problem is if you have a work retirement account then you can’t deduct the TIRA contribution. The reason for this is if you are priced out of RIRA, then you definitely exceed limit for deducting TIRA contribution.

Your 3 options are don’t contribute to IRA, contribute non deductible to TIRA and leave it (dumb), contribute non deductible to TIRA then backdoor to RIRA.

Other options. If you think you will be switching jobs at some point in the next few years and you are not maxing 401k, switch that $6500 to R401k then rollover to RIRA when job switching….but this isn’t necessary because a backdoor ROTH exists.

Edit: If you don’t have a 401k, and you are single, then you need to see if you go past the 24% bracket. If you do, then there’s a strong case for going TIRA. If you remain in 24%, there’s a really strong case that RIRA is better in the long term.",306
">If I currently have $200k as my taxable income today, and I plan having $100k as my taxable income in retirement, wouldn't a traditional IRA be better?

Yes.  But there's a catch: do you participate in a retirement plan through your job?  If so, the IRS does not let you deduct Traditional IRA contributions (above their income threshold for deductions), so those dollars remain ""after tax"" for this year.  You won't be ""double taxed"" on those dollars (at least as long as you keep your tax return accurate), they'll come out as non-taxable ""basis"" during retirement.  But unlike a Roth (which also use today's after-tax dollars for contributions), all the **earnings** from those non-deductible contributions are treated as taxable.  And you don't get to pick ""just"" the non-taxable dollars, all withdrawals come out as a proportional mix of taxable + non-taxable.

But if you've got access to a work plan, then you can simply do your pre-tax contributions into that instead of a Traditional IRA.  IMO, once the backdoor becomes necessary, your savings priority should shift to pre-tax.  Only after using up all your available pre-tax options should the backdoor come onto the table.  That means the full IRS maximum ($22,500 for 2023 and $23,000 for 2024), not just whatever gets you the most employer match.",306
"Head is working. Traditional is preferable.

Problem is that there is a fairly low income cutoff for deducting Tradtional IRA contributions, if you are covered by a 401k.  So, for you, it's not even an option (assuming you have a 401k).

If you put $$ into a Traditional IRA, it will be taxed and you can't take deductions. When you withdraw, the gains are taxed as ordinary income. That's a pretty bad deal, and it's why people use backdoor Roth instead.",306
"Do a Roth mega backdoor IRA and save for a house. 

The secret is taking money out early isn’t penalized if it’s just principal; earnings aren’t taxed/penalized if you take it out early. 

If you put in $100k and it grows to $150k, you can take out $100k without issue and let the $50k grow tax free until retirement.",306

So you were 22 when you dropped out and now you're 30? That's 8 years.

What did you do or tried to do beside Ubering? There is a HUGE gap in your post.

Not necessary but may be useful to help you on your possibilities.

>If you were in my situation what would you do? 

To me, there are 2 solutions and none of them are great I won't lie here.

>I’ve moved in with family in an attempt to keep my cost of living low.I just accepted a job offer that will pay 48,000/yr and I am applying for part-time work. I also have a small business where I provide remote admin services to businesses and busy professionals (I only have 1 client right now so not much income coming in from this but hoping to build and land a few more clients). I also do my best to doordash whenever feasible.

I would do exactly that.  Keep living with family until everything is paid off. Talk with them and work a living plan. Every dollar that is not necessary to live, eat and work should go on the debt. I will let you some money for few subcribtions for entertainment because it's cheap fun and a cheap gym membership. You don't need anything else for now. Every dollar earned outside of your main salary should be used to get you out of that situation a day earlier. There is no golden solution here. You're making 48k/year with 77k in debt where 17k of it is probably on 20%+ interest rate.  We are talking easily 3-5 years, hopefully more 3 than 5 depending on how much work you can muster on those years.

Another solution could be bankruptcy on everything but non-federal student loans debt + my last paragraph. I don't know the rules and regulations on this solution so I hope somebody could give you better advice on this. This would be to give the car back. This would be not having credit for a long time. It seems like one of the story I would consider this.

The past is the past. You need to focus on now so that at 35 years you are out of debt, an emergency fund in place and some direction of career for the next 30 years of your life. That's what I want for you. Would you be happy at 35 with those 3 things? If so, focus on that.",313
"I have seen the suggestions regarding bankruptcy and that might be a viable option. I am not familiar with the specifics so can’t reasonably comment on that. 

If you want to tackle your debt without bankruptcy then I would start with keeping your living expenses as low as possible. Can you maintain your current family living situation? If so, then I would do the following:

1. Concentrate on your high interest loans first and aggressively pay them off. Credit card interest rates can be difficult to overcome if you don’t eliminate those debts. A debt consolidation loan with a lower interest rate could be a path to alleviate some of that interest as you pay those debts down. 

2. Apply for the SAVE program offered by the Department of Education through your loan servicer. If your income is low enough then it will minimize your payments and you could receive credits toward forgiveness. As a side note, if your job is government or non-profit then you can apply for Public Service Loan Forgiveness. After 10 years (120 payments) then the remainder of your student loan balance can be forgiven. This program has been in effect since 2007. My wife had over $90k in debt of which the remainder that she hasn’t paid will soon be forgiven after 10 years of payments.  

3. Your vehicle is a tough choice. If you can manage the monthly payment, insurance, fuel, and maintenance while aggressively tackling your debt then it is manageable. How long is the term?

If you forfeit the vehicle then it isn’t the end of the world. It will lower your credit score and will keep it 50-100 points below its peak until it drops off after 7 years. I have lived through it and moved on. I had an 842 credit score 6 months ago so know that a repossession won’t keep your credit down forever. 

I wouldn’t give up on your education but you must get your finances under control before pursuing further. If you are frugal, consistent, and committed to the plan then you could be in a much better place in a few years.",313
"Unfortunately, you really have no choice but to pay the student loans off as you are able.  They are not dischargeable in bankruptcy.  Try to make headway on the $1,900 student loan and the two $2,000 student loans first---simply because they are smaller amounts.

Try to pay off credit card #4 in the next 2-3 months, if possible.  It's small, and you will feel as if you are making progress once you pay it off.

I think you might be able to pay all of this off in around 4 years or so.

And I think that every time you pay off a loan, you should re-post this with the respective loan amount crossed through so you can really start seeing your progress.",313
"Former healthcare recruiter here: 

If you had good science grades those first 2 years you should consider an associates degree in nursing. You can do it while working which would allow you put a hold on your loans while going to school. You likely have the majority of the hard science done. If you can finish that program you can easily get a job paying you 32~ an hour. You can work and continue school and get your NP where your income would go up to 110-150k allowing you do essentially do what a PAC can. 

I know it doesn’t directly answer your question but if you do that and get a job working for an academic hospital or system you may qualify for PSLF + many hospitals have 20k incentives where they will pay for you to get educated to become an RN. 

Radiological technologist is another good one too. 

Just something to be considered if you’re still interested in healthcare",313
"Living with family,I assume cheaply, should remove basically all your other expenses. This is a tackleable goal. 

People in here push bankruptcy ALOT. But everyone in here asking for advice borrowed all this money, shouldn’t we pay it back?

By the time your credit recovers in 7 years you could definitely have this paid off by then.  

“Let the bank take your car”- you’ll still owe money on it after it’s sold so if you deem it reliable enough to keep for 5 years, keep it.

As someone who is currently paying off debts, it takes awhile but the automatic payments become second nature and just part of the routine.",313
"You need to find a way to increase your income. 

Personally, I don’t recommend starting over in nursing. Nursing has a [high burnout rate](https://www.healthcarefinancenews.com/news/nurses-faring-better-despite-still-high-rates-burnout#:~:text=Eighty%2Done%20percent%20of%20nurses,logged%20in%20the%20previous%20year), and if you’re not resilient, you might end up quitting the career early and racking up more debt. If you do wanna go back to school, the best way is to get a job at a college where a perk is free education or working for another employer with tuition reimbursement.


My recommendation is to work toward a management position in your current job. You can also look into [Amazon flex](https://flex.amazon.com/) as a side gig.",313
"I look forward to seeing what other folks here say, but bankruptcy feels like the best option from my point of view.",313
"The only way out of this is to grind it out.  ""How do you eat an elephant?   One bite at a time. ""

If you can live with family while you do it and work, then that is precisely what I would do if I were in your shoes.  Sort these debts, all of them, in a spreadsheet in order from highest interest rate to lowest.  Start at the top, and grind it out.  First thing, save enough cash in a HYSA to cover your auto deductible/health deductible (whatever is higher.) as an emergency fund.  Then, focus on the debts.

I am presuming you've learned your lesson and no longer use credit cards as loans.  Stop using them.   Start zero based budgeting, where you literally give every single dollar coming in a job.  You've got this.  It will take time, patience, and years.  Try to remember that it took you years to accumulate the debt, it will not go away easily/quickly.",313
I am a recruiter with the Army I would go this route. You can do it full or part time and possible get them loans paid off and go through school for free to get your A.S in nursing possibly even more if you want.,313

If you suspect that this isn't a stranger but someone close to your mother, consider if anyone has access to the home that could have made the purchases and returned the cards to her: family, friends, any recurring workers in the home. I also hate to mention it, but if there's any chance that your mother did this herself and is claiming fraud to cover for it, please assist her. Unforeseen reasons for this include scams, mental illness, or simply bad decisions. If you could rule those out, that would be great.",314
"The short answer is that they really can't be. 

The card itself can be cloned, but the chip cannot be. That chip is specifically designed and assigned to the card and creates a unique tokenized pin number each time it is used. That is what makes the chip technology so secure. 

If the transaction was done using the chip, the physical card was present for the transaction.

Source: I work at a major credit card company and I spent a good deal of time in the fraud department


If you are confident that there has not been any additional cards sent out on the accounts, it is unlikely that there is any ID fraud, it is more likely that someone close to the cardholder took the card used it and then put the cards back. 

As far as next steps you may need to file a police report. It is theft and is a crime. The police also would have additional tools to reach out to the stores directly to pull surveillance footage.",314

Honestly this sounds like a no-brainer to accept assuming you don't mind working at the company. Mental health and work-life balance are important, so if you are going to be miserable working there for the next 12 months, take that into consideration. But getting a 20% retention bonus to stay with a company you're familiar with and are generally happy with sounds like a cushy deal to me.

Also, be sure to consider the opportunity cost associated with staying. Are your skills atrophying? Could you make >20% more by switching companies? Things like that are important to answer for yourself.

"The issue on these is often a company will use it to keep you most of the year and then if they don't want to pay it, just dismiss you 2 weeks before the 12 months is up. 

For that reason, you might want a clause that vests you partially in your bonus each month you stay, but only if they dismiss you.

Maybe, maybe not.  But this shouldn't be your concern.  Law enforcement would be the ones to issue a ticket for lack of insurance.

Insurance companies don't care so much and do not have the legal authority to levy penalties in the legal sense.

And I believe if this causes any hardships you would even have grounds to sue one of them over their own gross negligence.

You should be able to go back and get the information you need from the PCP and submit to insurance to process it correctly and pay the specialist. This should have been handled by the specialist office. If nothing else usually insurance companies will reimburse you the cost after it's processed correctly. Specialist can and will continue to try to collect on the amount owed but most are usually willing to give you some time to settle the issue with the insurance.

That’s not the way *normal* people do it.  Normal people ACH or write a check. Churners use credit cards.  A normal person would choose a different method to transfer funds.  A novice churner would call the bank multiple times and then complain about getting shut down.  All signs point to you being the latter not the former.

"Was the condo warrantied by the builder?

Have you consulting with a real estate attorney about suing the builder?",330

"Something to keep in mind is that if you sell, ALLLLL this stuff is going to have to be disclosed to potential buyers.  Any other buyer will see the writing on the wall just like you do and they will want the condo priced accordingly.

The other suggestions about speaking to a litigation attorney for a consultation is good advice.  Piercing the corporate veil can be challenging, but not impossible.  Some courts have taken dim views of such blatant attempts to avoid responsibility for obviously shoddy work.  It's going to depend heavily on your location.  You cannot possibly make a good decision without knowing where you stand.

Something that confuses me is your description of some of the repairs you're responsible for.  Is this a condo, a zero lot-line home, a PUD, or something else?  The type of ownership is going to affect how you think about this going forward because the last pieces of information you need is how much how much would it cost to fix what needs to be fixed and how much can you fix yourself.  Things like the size of parking spaces and community gates are obviously outside your ability to fix.  However, in your current ownership structure, how many of the problems can you fix yourself?  Are you responsible for the crumbling concrete?  Can you fix or replace the roof yourself? 

If individual owners are responsible for the majority of the problems, then you can go about looking at how much its going to cost to fix everything, and see how that pencils out compared to paying a new mortgage in a world of 6-7% interest rates.  If the most expensive of these problems are communal, then you need to take a hard look at getting out now before you get slapped with an assessment.",330
"Agree with the comments about suing the builder. Especially considering there are issues with the foundation.

"Can I ask you how this actually works, and what you are hoping to get out of it? Is it reimbursement for specific repairs, or some sort of total lost value due to the overall condition of the building?",330
Yes that happens but I would still look into it.,330
"Why? There's the builder warranty but they usually do not build the house. They contract the work out and most of the contractors also include their warranties that far exceed the builders warranty. For example, most roofing companies for these builders give a 10 year warranty. OP, if you are reading this, the builder should have given you a book and in that book it should have some documentation of who the contractors were. This is something they want to give you because they do not want you calling them after the 1 year warranty is up.",330
Which is why I would have a hard time trusting a renamed or new business.  But unfortunately the well established and trusted contractors often have the price tag that comes with it.,330
"Have a discussion with a litigation attorney. It won’t hurt, and will definitely give you more of a concrete answers than transactional attorneys would, since they typically avoid litigation.

So many consumers let things go because they’re spooked about it taking a while and being expensive, but, depending on the price of the condo, the money at stake may be sufficient for an attorney to represent you on contingency, so you wouldn’t have to pay the costs anyway.",330
"Yup we got a great contractor

"> You can sort of do the opposite: you have until April 15 2024 to make a 2023 IRA contribution. So you can do your taxes, get the refund, make the contribution, then amend your taxes :) But that's silly.

If you file earlier than 4/15, you're allowed to report a contribution you haven't made yet, as long as you actually do make it. So in theory it is possible to file in January, report a contribution you haven't actually made, and then use your refund to make the claimed contribution. Of course, if you fail to make the contribution on time, then you need to amend and take it off.

Generally, the contribution must be made by the due date of your return, not including extensions.](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p590a#en_US_2022_publink1000230431)

They also have an income threshold. If she made under the income threshold you don’t have to file anything for her and you won’t need to pay the employer portion of FICA. If she made over the threshold, you need to pay your portion of FICA and you’ll need to give her a W2.",354

Going with individual companies can be considered similar to gambling. Most companies actually aren't great investments, using broad coverage index funds gives you the best chance at holding the winners.

If you must, use a small amount (I'd say no more than 10% of the stock based side of your portfolio, others may say 5%) for taking individual company bets.

">How will this affect me during tax filing?

Your taxable income for the year will go up by the amount of the withdrawal, plus you'll owe a penalty tax of 10% of the withdrawal.

Your taxes withheld for the year will go up by the amount you withheld. 

If you withheld too much, you'll get a refund.

If you withheld too little, you'll owe the difference (or if you withheld too much elsewhere your refund will be reduced).",364
"To be clear, note *withholding* is not the same as *tax*. Your withholding will be what you want it to be (default on many places is 10%, but you can opt out of this). You then pay tax on the rest of the 43% or so of tax you incurred.

By my amateur calculations, the tax for a CA resident in the 22% federal bracket and 9.3% state bracket is 22% income, 10% federal penalty, CA income and [2.5% penalty](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/file/personal/income-types/early-distributions.html) which you [see on line 4 here](https://www.ftb.ca.gov/forms/2021/2021-3805p.pdf)

$5,000 x (22% + 10% + 9.3% + 2.5%) = $2,190

So net distribution  is $2,810

I don't know where you got the CA tax being 10% of the federal marginal rate + 10%, there's no way that's right.

>How will this affect me during tax filing?

If you had <$2,190 withheld, your refund totals will go down (or amount due will go up) by $2,190 minus withholding.  
If you had >$2,190 withheld, your refund totals will go up (or amount due will go down) by withholding minus $2,190.  
If you had $2,190 withheld, no  change.",364

This is not the Backdoor Roth strategy that you've been reading about.

What you describe is simply referred to as a ""conversion.""

In other words, remove the word ""backdoor"" in your plan.  All you're doing is simply a conversion of Traditional assets to Roth assets.  In doing so, you pay the tax at ordinary income rates.

Converting Traditional assets to Roth is generally recommended in years of low income.

Typically this involves sabbaticals, going back to school, or (in your case) temporary/partial retirement.",372

The primary con is that tax hit from the conversion.  If you'll be having a low income (so low tax rate) year, that tax hit is smaller than it might be at some other time.

>And what part of the five year rules apply to me in these circumstances? I’m worried about locking up money for 5 years but it doesn’t seem that would be the case, right?

Only the dollars converted have to remain in the Roth IRA for 5 years.  So if you already have a Roth IRA with a balance of $100k and you convert $10k from your Traditional into it (conversion does not require a newly opened one), then you can still pull up to $100k out of that IRA over the next 5 years with no consequence.

If you have no existing Roth IRA balance, then you are correct that none of that money can be withdrawn penalty free until 2028, assuming you execute the conversion before December 31st.  Though IIIRC it'd become accessible as of January 1st 2028, I don't think the five years counts from the actual date of the conversion.",372

"Do you want a tax-advantaged savings account or a tax-advantaged **investment** account where you can buy mutual funds?

An IRA at a bank / credit union is the first one.  An institution can really only offer IRAs with an ""inside"" account matching their normal set of products.  While you can open an IRA at a credit union, it's still going to be at best a savings account (maybe option to buy CDs) with a savings account's interest rate.  This is almost always a poor choice for anyone not already in retirement (who'd be more focused on maintaining account balance value vs. growth).

If you want to buy VOO, the IRA has to be at an institution that has accounts supporting buying VOO.  I'd say Vanguard is your better option for that.

I suppose it's possible your CU has partnered with an investment brokerage, so the IRA won't technically be held with them, and be able to offer a wider selection of financial products to hold in the IRA.

They may also still offer financial advise to their customers regardless of where you hold your retirement accounts.  That's a somewhat common feature through credit unions, though I guess it could have a fee if ""outside"" accounts are involved.",382

>I know if I have a HSA account in the future, I can reimburse myself with any medical expenses that I pay now when I am older,

Only if you **already** have an HSA established prior to incurring the medical expense.  One of the criteria for an HSA's ""qualified medical expense"" is that the date of service happened after the HSA was opened.  There's a bit of wiggle room, in practice it's more about having **any** HSA open (and maybe contributed to?) in your name before the date of service.  So if you happen to have an old HSA now (getting no contributions because you're not eligible), incur an expense, get a new HSA in 2025, add money to that new HSA, you could validly request reimbursement, leveraging that ""grandfathered"" HSA's establishment date.

I'm not quite experienced with who FSAs deal with qualified expenses and your ability to use money that cross ""plan years"" while still happening in a given ""calendar year"".  But in general, if you had an expense incurred in 2023, you can only use FSA money associated with 2023 for it.  I believe even if you get on a payment plan, it's the date you had the medical visit that matters, not the billing date of any particular bill.",384

"The share value when they were initially promised is mostly irrelevant.  From your perspective all that matters is their value at vest, since this is the amount treated as taxable income at that time.  That value also sets their basis for calculating capital gain/loss when eventually sold.

>My understanding is that I am liable for that additional 10% if I sell short-term. 

You're liable for some tax immediately on vest, whether you later sell as short-term or long-term.  Say you vest 100 shares at $56.  That $5600 is counted as part of your current year's regular income.  It's treated essentially the same as your employer paying you a (taxable) $5600 cash bonus which you then use to buy 100 shares of stock.  

The money from the sell to cover is sent to the IRS as an estimated payment towards that increased tax bill.  But that doesn't change the actual tax rate applied to those dollars.  So continuing my above example, 22 of the shares get sold, the 22 \* $56 = $1232 cash from that sale is sent to the IRS in your name, and you now hold the remaining 78 shares in your account.  But since this extra $5600 of income will result in a tax increase of $5600 \* 32% = $1792, the ""missing"" $560 will need to be settled up somehow.  That could be done on your return itself (reducing your refund or added to an ""amount owed""), increasing your paycheck withholding to ""make up"" for it over the rest of the year, or you making your own estimated tax payment to the IRS.

The shares you hang onto then have potential taxable capital gains depending on how much the price increases above that $56 basis.  Say you sell those within a year for $60.  You'll have a 78 \* $4 = $312 short-term capital gain, which again gets taxed at 32%, increasing your owed tax $312 \* 32% = $99.84. Selling after a year (say price sticks at that $60) means your owed tax is $312 \* 15% = $46.80.

In general, selling RSUs immediately tends to be the advice.  You incur the tax owed from the vest (which happens regardless), but a sale soon after won't have much price change, so not much additional capital gain tax.  If you've already missed out on doing that, I'd think the next best option would be to sell off shares after holding for a year to leverage the lower long-term capital gain rate.  I'd think for you that'd be 15%; there is a 20% LTCG rate but that doesn't kick in until your income is in the 35-37% regular income tax bracket.",386
What is the cost basis. The RSU 'price' doesn't mean anything for taxes. When the RSU units became shares price compared to what you sell at is what matters for taxes.,386
"Thank you, this makes much more sense.

&#x200B;

I have 58 shares with a cost basis of $40.84 that vested in march.

I have 27 shares with a cost basis of $45.52 and $45.94 that vested in June and September.The stock price is at $55 atm.

I think I should hold onto the 58 shares to pay long term capital gains tax for sure.If I were to sell the other 27 shares as short term shares today, it sounds like the additional short term tax would be relatively minimal. I am thinking of selling that and parking it to collect 4.5% interest.as I am concerned this stock price will not hold.",386
"Honestly, in terms of raw dollars (rather than percentages), it's not a huge swing either way.  From some rough estimates from your numbers, if you took the short-term capital gain tax hit on all those shares, your tax bill will be around $225 higher compared to selling everything as long-term.  If you decide that cost is worth having $6k cash in your hands now vs. some future date (at potentially lower share price), that's not a ""wrong"" perspective.  Since that biggest lot will transition to long-term in just a few months, delaying selling those is a perfectly viable choice too.",386

"As I understand it, a target date fund will gradually move to a more conservative mix of investments approaching retirement - and then remain at that mix after the target year passes.

Let's see what that looks like for the Vanguard Target Retirement Fund 2020:

33.00% Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund

23.90% Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund Institutional Plus Shares

16.20% Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund Investor Shares

14.70% Vanguard Total International Bond II Index Fund

12.20% Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund Admiral Shares

https://investor.vanguard.com/investment-products/mutual-funds/profile/vtwnx#portfolio-composition

So.... Roughly, this fund finishes up at about 40-ish% in broad equity index funds, 50-ish% in bond index funds, and a 10-ish% percent in funds related to short-term US treasuries. This is designed to be a good balance for a retiree who still needs some growth for the future - but is more concerned about stability.

"Schwab, for example, still offers Target Index 2020 fund SWYLX for people in your age bracket. Their 2010 and 2015 funds are still available, as well.

Their funds continue to slowly get more and more bond-oriented until 20 years past retirement, when they level off at about 25% stocks. Other fund vendors will employ slightly different glidepaths, of course.",389
"The ""Target Date Funds"" are called that because their allocations change every few years, as the target date gets closer.  Those funds start with a higher stock allocation and slowly switch to higher bond and cash allocation as the target date draws near.

After retirement, what you want are funds that are generally called ""Asset Allocation Funds"".  They will typically have a specific asset allocation that stays mostly constant from year to year (i.e., a Balanced Fund will be somewhere in the 50-60% stock allocation, a Conservative fund will usually be in the 30-50% stock allocation, and a Growth Allocation fund will typically be in the 60-80% stocks).",389
"I feel like nobody here has actually answered your question.


The point of a target date fund is to have that fund be ""ready"" for when you retire. The fund tends to get more conservative in its approach as you get closer to the date.


For you, this means that you can just pick a different target date fund, and the further away that target date fund, the riskier the investment. You can pick a fund where the date has passed, and it will just be a conservative mix, so that you are unlikely to lose much money in the value.",389

If you'd drawing less than 4% than you could go more bonds and cash but at 4% I wouldn't go much below 50% in stock.",389

I know a lot of retired people that simply move 10-20% of their money to cash, CD's and short term bonds and put the rest in a stock index fund. If you have say $1M that means $100-200k in safe cash paying a decent interest rate and $800-900k that will be volatile but will grow, pay dividends, hedge inflation, and provide something to leave to your heirs.",389

Secondly, you trading long stranglrs at 0 dte. If the underlying moves, you make money. But here's the catch - there will be days when the underlying remains static, and then your strangle will slowly melt like an ice cube sitting on a plate.

Backtesting this over a long period would give an indication of how much edge this strategy has. Until then, we'll done on the profit you've made so far, but it feels a little bit of a coin toss.

Happy trading.",394
I've just closed another one after a 10 point ES move. Bought 4615 calls for $1.00 and 4530 puts for $0.95.......sold the calls for $2.10 and puts for $0.35....= $0.50 profit (+25%).,394
"Why SPX ? 

Do you also do it on SPY ?",394
[deleted],394
Any thoughts on the strategy?,394
"Thank you. Thing is I watch it and if the day seems like a complete dud I would cut the loss. But see in these examples, even a small move of 6-10 points in ES results in a good profit. As for backtesting, the tool I have only allows RTH, do you know of a tool that allows extended hours?",394
Sounds like a short box spread with extra steps.,394
"Good for low IV environments. 

Shit in high IV",394
"Sorry, I am not aware of any tool that allows testing outside RTH.

Do you open your strangle in the morning before market open for options expiring that same day, or do you open them the evening before? 

Years ago, I did some backtesting of something like this, by opening a strangle about 15 minutes before the market close (3:45pm EST) and then closing it about 30 mins after market open the next day to catch any overnight gap. I cannot remember what my results looked like but I assume it wasn't good cos I'm not trading that strategy anymore.

Good look and keep posting your experiences.",394
How so? The contracts would be more expensive but theoretically it should all be relative?,394
"I open that trades around 2-4am EST. My broker, Interactive Brokers, allows 24/5 trading SPX. My strategy is completely dependent on trading after hours. Open trades when SPX is dead and consolidating and close when it breaks either up or down. As little as 6-10 points yields great results.",394
"It's not relative. 

Higher IV has more theta decay. There's more extrinsic value. 

You need larger swings with high IV to profit",394
"Got it. I'm with IBKR too.

What's your average hold time for these trades? Do you hold till market open at all?",394
"I actually haven't had to hold until market open yet. Yesterday was 30min today was 2hr40min. I really like the fact that they don't bleed value. As long as you enter while price and associated IV is quite, any move will make the winning leg pump. Entering after a big move means the contracts have already gained a bunch of value.

Try to get the contracts for $1.00 each and ensure the price for the calls & puts is the same.",394
Nevermind…just found out by simply entering /BTC:XCME,395
"Wdym you're long ways from theta decay? Time decay is there on options even if they're 2 years out and deep ITM. 

You could sell short calls against it (PMCC) or you could take profits if you're think it's due for a pull back. You can buy back in at some other time.",396
"You can always reduce the exposure by selling some of them. But if you have only one, roll the strike to something slightly otm.


That way you reduce your delta exposure, secure some profits and if you are greedy and think it will continue to go up, you can put more risk by increasing the number of contracts, raising your leverage. This is risky, i tend to choose the first path.",396
"I'd sell calls/call spreads weekly 5%+ OTM.  If you've got 20 calls, sell 20 call narrow spreads.",396
[deleted],396
Just buy stock,396
You can sell options against it to turn it into diagonal or calendar spread.,396
"I would either 'split' the option by giving up some time and potentially depth ITM +/- for quantity depending on your goal. Say the option contract you have is worth 10k try and find an expiry that's trading around 1k and roll that into those and now you have 10 contracts and can sell some or keep trading the price action that way, I did it with DKNG this summer, turned about 8 DEC 25 calls into 12 contracts for FEB/March 38/39c that were OTM when I rolled into them and are up 80% and now ITM and I also opened positions into other stocks off the initial investment too. I bet if you look into an Expiry that's 9-12 months you could probably turn the 1 into 5-10 contracts and that will make taking profits easier, because if you have 5 contracts selling one is an easy way to capitalize, and, the process can continue. So long as the stock maintains your expected direction, I believe you can roll your options position indefinitely, I am a beginner but at some point it may be worth trying to play the swings of the stock, something else I learned about my example trade is I had no position to play the swings, which it did so violently this summer, if I had the practice and patience I would have profited exponentially with a put position to sell on the red days, for DKNG it would go 5-10% at time, just unnatural movement, so I would not typically expect that type of volatility, but, I think you will have a more confident understanding of the stock you're invested in. I'm experimenting with that now because I took one of the calls and rolled into a Put that was slightly ITM and it expires the same date as my calls and they are $1 apart so I have 1 put at 39 and 9 calls at 38 and the stock has somewhat stalled in the upper 30's, so, it may pullback, hopefully we'll get a very red day from here until February that will allow me to close/roll that contract. This will cap some upside though because at some point depending on how many contracts you'll juggle some may close for an acceptable loss, though if everything is perfect and your thesis is intact than exiting the hedge leg maybe profitable too, say your contracts are for 3 months and your bullish long but there's a red month in-between your hedge turns into more profit and worst case is the stock moves strongly towards your thesis the amount of returns from your main position should easily eclipse whatever loss from the hedge position.",396
Don’t buy leaps. Use synthetics or ratio spreads. Enter positions where theta is neutral or in your favor.,396
"Theta decay is in, but doesn’t it really start to ramp up only 1 year from expiration?

Also my broker is strict and doesn’t allow Poor man’s covered calls 🥲",396
"The decay on options that far out is pretty minimal. I don't really worry about time decay until we get under 3 months.

If you're expecting a pullback I would sell calls against them. In the past I've also closed an itm call to buy one atm and used the extra for another play.",396
"I do only have one. Do you actually mean an OTM from current stock price, or slightly less ITM?

My understanding is slightly OTM will still be quite expensive, which will  push my B/E further up, on an already really slow moving stock, I might get rekt by theta… at least on DEEP ITM calls I have a lot of intrensic value to save my ass? Am I getting this right?",396
"Strike is at 35$ CAD.

Enbridge is one of the major canada blue chips companies with assets across several energy sectors. Very healthy dividends but a lot of debts, which is bound to go down as interest rates start going down as well, so my guess is it’s gonna keep slowly crawling up on-par it’s usual really low volatility.

I’m new at options, but I’m trying to talk myself into grabbing profits when I see them.",396
"I'm gonna make a practical example to you so you can understand my idea of reducing risk and leverage and the other way around, so you can choose what fits your risk tolerance.

&#x200B;

On the first example, let's say in February, before earnings, i bought a META 250 Calls expiring in 2025. Hypotetically i paid 1,5k USD. Now meta is 300+, my LEAPS are now worth 15k of intrinsic value + time left.

If i just want to take my profits but i want to keep a runner in case it keeps going up, i sell that 150C for 15+k, and i buy a 400 Call expiring the same date and i pay like, 2k or something, in that scenario i secured 13k+ of profits. That way if the stock goes back to 150, instead of losing the whole 13k, i will only lose 1,5kish.

&#x200B;

But, if i'm really greedy and want to leverage myself even more, thinking the stock will skyrocket, i will sell that 150c, and instead of buying just one contract of the 400C, i buy 6 of them. Does it make sense? 

&#x200B;

On the first scenario, the other thing it could happen is that you roll up, the stock drops, you lose way less and you're sitting on a lot of cash, you can then roll the strike down and further away, giving you opportunity to leverage more again for a next pump.",396

"The best trading is sort of, by definition, sporadic. 

If you are trading on purely delta then the best times to trade are often: wait 12 months for a low, buy in, wait 12 months. 

If you are trading on volatility/vega then of course you look for times of uncertainty etc. 

For PURELY theta exposed plays you can trade any time but over all income will be very close to just tracking the market (buy and hold). 

A huge huge mistake most traders make is forcing trades at a time that just…doesn’t fit the thesis. Beyond anything this is a trade of discipline and self control.",397

Second, learn to understand the different ""seasons"" in the market. The combination of price action and implied vol through most of 2022 is/was dramatically different than what we've seen through most of 2023, particularly the last month. 

You adjust your approach depending on the character that the market is showing. 

I had to learn this the hard way as I was a one-trick pony selling OTM irons until the character shifted and kicked my ass about 16 years ago. The Market is always trying to show you where the edge is. Few stop to listen, most continue banging the square peg into the round hole.",397
"I have two accounts. With the larger account, about 200K, I'm primarily doing a wheel strategy with CSPs and Covered Calls, and then I'll do a few other strategies here and there as well.

"**You are 100% correct!**  You cannot make large returns from a small amount of capital . . .  Anyone who says you or they can is not telling the truth.

Options are NOT a get rich quick method!

Good experienced traders may make 10% to 15% **annual returns** on a fairly consistent basis, some may make more, but using the more conservative and reliable lower percentages will mean an account of $650K for a 10% return, or about $435K for a 15% returns . . .  THIS is how it works.

Traders who can earn higher return percentages over many years of trading may be able to make $65K per year with less capital, but few to none can make consistent returns over 30% year after year.

Let's talk about consistency.  Options trading does not have any guarantees of profits at all, much less over any period of time.  Some months may have 20% returns, while other months may have negative returns.  What to look at is annual returns over multiple years to see average performance and then spread that over time.  An example is a trader who has made 17% returns over 5 years of trading and would then need about $385K to make a $65K yearly return.

Trading is a learned skill that takes a couple of years and a good size account, options are not an automatic teller machine which you seem to expect . . .

Your conclusions show you lack of understanding and if you follow this sub or r/thetagang you would clearly see your expectations and conclusions are wildly inaccurate.",397

"If I sell a CC on stock, it means that I believe the stock is fairly valued or slightly overvalued and that I don't think it has much upside potential, nor downside. 

If the CC loses value it means that

A) Something major happened which invalidates my thesis and my valuation of the stock, in which case I liquidate both the stock and buy back the short call (it depends on how ITM/OTM the call was initially). 

B) The stock is now fairly valued or undervalued, meaning I hold my CC or buy back the short call if I really am sure it's undervalued

"1. The first rule of CCs is to only sell them at a strike price you are willing to see the shares get called away at.  You are trading a certain amount of guaranteed premium in exchange for giving up any possible upside movement of the stock.  This is how it works.
2. If the stock moves up and the CC can be rolled out in time, and possibly up in strike, for a net credit this may help collect more premium and possible profit.  It is not recommended to roll for a debit as this reduces the possible profits.  
3. Not sure if your wording is correct, as the CC losing value indicates it is profiting.  
4. Most CCs are opened around a 60 dte timeframe and then closed at a preset profit amount, some like 50% but this is up to each trader, or allowed to expire for a 100% profit with the shares called away if the CC is ITM.
5. The risk of CCs is the stock price dropping, which would see the call profit when it can be closed.  A stop loss amount on the shares can be set prior to the trade being opened, however, most who sell CCs do so on stocks they wish to hold so a temporary drop may not cause them to close for a loss.  
6. Based on reading your other replies you may wish to close the call for a partial profit and sell the shares if you wish to exit the trade.  

Hope this helps . . .",398

-30x 70.5 puts

-1x 70 puts.

">Can someone explain to me why in the option volume  for the same strike, larger orders with approximately the same premiums, but opposite orders, one is buying and the other selling, are not added?

here is what chatgpt says

&#x200B;

The option volume represents the total number of contracts traded for a particular option during a given time period. When you see larger orders with approximately the same premiums for the same strike but opposite sides (buying and selling), they are generally not added together in the reported volume for a couple of reasons:  
  
Double-Counting: If both the buyer and the seller are adding to the same volume, it would result in double-counting. Each contract represents a commitment between a buyer and a seller, so counting both sides of the transaction would inflate the total volume.  
  
Net Volume Reporting: Exchanges typically report the net volume, which is the total number of contracts traded after offsetting buying and selling orders at the same strike and expiration. If 10 contracts are bought and 10 contracts are sold at the same strike, the net volume is zero.",405

The former should preclude the latter, if we're talking about deep ITM contracts near expiration.

If you have $10 of intrinsic and you offer to sell for $9, who in their right mind would not take $1 of free money?

"It's pretty useless to look at this combination. The Greeks are by definition computed as an all-else equal sensitivity (it's a mathematical derivative).

* Delta just tells you what happens if the underlying moves a bit and nothing else would change. 
* Theta shows how much the option value changes (in a year if you compute the derivative but it's usually scaled down to a day). 

The theta value depends on moneyness (so in a sense delta) but mainly time to maturity. [This Quant se](https://quant.stackexchange.com/a/74856/54838) answer has computer code that you can copy paste to try it out yourself. It provides the computed theta (also scaled for one day) for all sorts of combinations of inputs and days. 

For example, you will see that Theta crosses the ratio of the price over the number of days left to expiry (P/N) from above at the lowest level of P/N when plotted with time remaining until expiration. This point corresponds graphically to the falling inflection point of theta.

On a side note, don't try to come up with strange ratios. They are useful to get PnL attribution and portfolio risk /hedging.",407
"Theta and delta are quite different. The fact that theta = delta is more of a coincidence than anything else and tells me you are looking at relatively short dated options if I'm not mistaken. 

Short-dated options tend to have a delta close to 0 (if they are OTM) or 1/-1 (if they are ITM) because they have very little time value in them and are highly dependent on the difference between the strike and the spot. 

The little time value they do hold is also decaying fast, so you get situations where delta = theta. If you look at long-dated options, the absolute value of theta will almost surely be lower than the absolute value of delta.",407
You should be more concerned with theta/gamma relationship than delta,407
I’d recommend finding a Black-Scholes option pricing calculator and playing with the variables to see how they affect theoretical pricing. CBOE has one on their site:  https://www.cboe.com/optionsinstitute/tools/options_calculator/,407

"Do mind that option greeks are not something you should obsess over unless you are trying to hedge something and/or do a volatility play or something like that.

It's good to know them, but if you're not hedging or doing long/short positions and whatnot, you should be thinking about how likely or unlikely it is that a stock will end up in a given price range within a certain date given your expectations. What option you buy and sell and at what price will derive from that. 

If you're trading short-dated options, you're trading market sentiment and unexpected events/announcements and that's what you should try to understand and get a feel for. For example, if you think a stock will be stuck in a certain price range for a few days or weeks, sell puts / bull put spreads when it reaches the bottom of the range and sell calls / bear call spreads when it reaches the top and choose your expiration date based upon how long you think it will hold. Liquidate your positions when you think you've squeezed most of the juice out of them and don't hold till expiry unless you know exactly what you're doing. 

Obviously, you will lose money if your expectations are wrong, as I said, unexpected news are here to ruin your day if you're not careful, which is why spreads are a good way to contain your losses. 

If for example you think something unexpected is about to happen, that's when buying short-dated calls and puts outright makes sense. If nothing happens, you will probably lose the premium you paid for these options. 

If you're trading longer dated options, you should focus more on fundamentals and try to understand if implied volatility is high or low because it will have a large impact on how your options perform.",407
"When you buy an option, you’re paying for convexity (gamma). When you sell an option, you’re selling the convexity. When you’re short gamma, to compensate for the risk of being stung by an outsized move, you’re paid theta. Sometimes gamma is cheap or expensive, and this will be reflected in both the implied volatility of the contract and the theta. As time goes on, gamma begins to decay, and as it does you collect money via theta or lose it if you’re long",407
I suspect the introduction of ODTE might be a factor.,408

The interest expense is basically the risk free rate. The delta of options (especially further out) tend to diverge putting delta=0.5 for puts and calls above the current price. This is basically a hidden cost. As your synthetic now either enters slightly above the current price giving the stock pressure to perform. Or your call will cost slightly more than your put will yield meaning you enter at a small debit.,410

I tradefrom the 9,13 to the target S/R line or to the 50, 200 SMAs.

The MACD should be confirming what's happening with the SMAs. Blue above yellow for upward moves, yellow above blue for downward moves. You must make sure thee is enough distance from the crossover point. 

The RSI also confirms what's happening with the SMAs and it gives an indication of how much time there is before that stock heads into overbought (RSI above 70) or oversold (RSI below 30) territory. Anything overbought or oversold generally indicates that a reversal is coming.",411

"Theta decay on holidays was one of the first things that came to mind when I first revisited options after university! I dropped it partly because Taleb’s book talks about 252 days, and also considering American holidays etc. in pricing options. Also because of thoughts below. My bad I didn’t track it as it’s so easy. 

Haven’t read the research papers, but how do you test a strategy whose drivers you cannot really determine? What happens to price on the weekend is not really statistically “testable”. 

In some ways, you’re “breaking” a time series, and assuming a relatively known theta vs unknown and possibly large, delta, gamma, vol. 

Also, there is a whole theory around predicting price action based on weekend moves. You’re pretty much going against the grain on that one, right?  

Even if you sold strangles, you can’t really gamma/delta hedge over the weekend, so how do you manage large moves at open on Mondays?",413

Beyond the list of studies I included above that prove in various ways that it is indeed a thing, I encourage you to also explore the work of Euan Sinclair, Lawrence McMillan, and Leonard Zachs - all, who discuss this exact thing. 

People confuse inefficiencies with “everyone getting rich”. Just as we have variance risk premiums and put skew, where we know definitively people willingly overpay fair value for puts, yielding another tradable inefficiency. However, that also is not a “get rich” definitively, as risk still exists. There are dozens of inefficiencies like this that exist, some more persistent than others, some with greater magnitude than others.",413

"OP, what you traded was a ""call calendar"", and your trade made more than max profit cos you held on after the short expired. At that point, your trade was no longer a calender but a simple long call. If your underlying had fallen, then you would have made a big loss.

Don't let this win suck you in with a false sense of success. You took a directional risk with the long call and this time it paid off.

Calendars are complex structures.

Complex is an understatement, and you can trade them in lots of ways (I know when and how I’ll get fucking clobbered, so, I’m actively trying to avoid that through my call selling, really I’m just managing delta and not trying to get gamma squeezed).

A simpler approach is to check out the first 15 minutes of one of the indexes (SPX for example) and look for significant movement in the first 15 minutes. It often retraces a decent amount after an overnight gap up or gap down. Or it’ll sometimes continue running if it’s doing so premarket.

That's not the only risk to consider. If you are reducing risk of your total portfolio, *you will necessarily reduce average gains as well*. Risk-reduction is fine, if that is what you want to do, just understand that you are lowering your overall return when you do so.

QQQ and QQQM are growth-oriented index funds. The last thing you should want to do with a growth-oriented equity investment is **put a cap on the upside of those investments**. That's what a covered call does, it caps the upside of your shares in exchange for cash today. If cash today is worth more to you than gains in the future, by all means, write CCs. Just don't be surprised if your total return after 15 years is worse than QQQ/QQQM without CCs.

Using 2 or even 3 stddev strikes reduces the frequency of sacrificing gains, but not the magnitude. If a 3 stddev strike is surpassed, you are in tail-risk territory and there's no upper bound on the move. For example, if 10% gains are 2 stddev and 12% is 3 stddev, but QQQ ends up making a 30% move, you're not going to feel like you made a good trade. Particularly since the further out of the money you go, the smaller the credit you get in compensation for sacrificing your upside.

More in-depth reasons why CCs on a long term growth-oriented equity portfolio is a bad idea:

"> I would be looking to practice this by paper trading first for 6mnths and do some research on which indexs this would be a good strategy on.


use the OptionStrat mobile app or website to 'paper trade' by saving trade ideas and then coming back to view how they turned out over time.

Personally, I'd also use TradingView and basic indicators (moving averages, RSI, MACD) on the daily and weekly to decide if the instrument is trending up, down or sideways, and then experiment with selling CCs when it is sideways or down, and selling put spreads when it is sideways or up, and see how that plays out in your OptionStrat 'saved' trades",417
"Yes, selling covered calls is a very common and relatively safe strategy.  

The risk is that the calls do expire in-the-money and you regret being forced to sell below the new market price.  If this risk is made negligible, so will be the premiums that you collect. 

I use covered calls and cash-secured puts at strike points that would execute trades that I'd need to do anyways for portfolio rebalancing.  That way I'm always happy, whether or not the option is exercised.",417
"If you're long on ETFs there isn't really a need to understand options other than maybe hedging for a market downturn. Most retail investors are people who just buy ETFs and sit on it. If it's something you want to pursue then more power too you. I have a separate trading account, my longs are generally my retirement accounts.  


The I ""effectively take no risk"" statement also mean you probably are only going to make like $2 per contract, assuming it even fills, not including fees. The people on the opposite end of the trade see the opposite where it is a high risk for them and it's less likely to win so they are not willing to pay a lot. Everything is priced in.

Also something to consider is the taxes because if you have an account sitting on 600k net value and you have +100k in unrealized gains if your covered calls are assigned, which in the US does not have to be the expiration date of the contract, then those are now realized gains that you will pay taxes on. Unless you are in a tax sheltered account. So you could make like $100 selling calls in option premium but if you got assigned then you may get a tax bill in the $10,000s next year. That's something that paper trading isn't going to teach you.",417
"I can help you in qqq, which is one of my ETFs that I manage. I do options, they are super profitable more than you can believe, with short movements they can generate great profits. Be careful to buy too far from the stike because it has to be out of money but only what is necessary",417
"You should absolutely be be selling cc against your long stock imho.  Learn How to roll and adjust by delta. Ie. 100 shares = 100 delta. If you sell a 30 delta call then you have 70 delta so if the stock goes up $1 you only realize 70 cents roughly, 3 standard deviations however is not going to give much premium though and I I would equate it to picking up Pennie’s in front of a steamroller.  After you have that down, or even before if you wish is to look into selling naked puts to get the shares in the first place.",417
"Yes covered calls are common -- I prefer doing them weekly but no reason you can't do them monthly.

The three options strategies I personally use are The Wheel when I want to accumulate a stock. This is basically writing puts as a way to either get premium or if the stock dips buy on the dip and calls much like the covered call strategy you were thinking about. Most people do puts then calls once they own the stock. I run this fairly aggressively with puts and calls at different strike prices until I get to my desired level of stock then I go to a less aggressive covered call strategy to get the capital out. I've been able to get my average price to negative on a few stocks.

The other two strategies are strangles and iron condors -- I do these on SPX. It is a pretty basic strategy where you goal is to keep the price between the upper and lower strike prices and then just let time pass.",417
"What you are describing is the covered call strategy, and yes it is quite common and a good starting point for getting into options strategies imo.

>and do some research on which indexs this would be a good strategy on

&#x200B;

This is really the crux of trading a strategy like this. If you are going to sell calls every month at X% strike and X% date, you will want to test and/or have a thesis as to why this would outperform a simple buy and hold. (e.g. why isn't everyone doing this, are too many people doing this?) It can be surprising how much those +20% moves influence the total return of a portfolio, and cutting it off is sometimes a net negative even with the premium. I personally think CCs are a great strategy, but just some things to keep in mind.

&#x200B;

I would also skip the paper trading. I think it's only useful for getting used to a broker's software, but if you want to throw up a couple of trades just so see how it looks and where to find the info you need that's great. Otherwise, just allocate a tiny amount to start trading options with and scale up from there.",417

"Sorry you had to deal with so much nonsense in this thread, particularly since Fidelity already admitted to being in the wrong.

I think Ken's answer is the best. If you can get the average price from Time & Sales after the time of liquidation, that's a fair number to ask for. I know that will be hard for an already-expired contract, though. It might be worth asking Fidelity to give you a spreadsheet with Time & Sales after liquidation, they have more access to that data, and if they provide it, they can't argue that it was made up.

Alternatively you might have to go to a data provider, like polygon.io. The free basic tier gives you 2 years of historical options price data with ""100% market coverage"", and the 50k data points limit is more than enough for your purpose.

I do.  They might play your game once depending on your profitability.  But they won't take a huge loss for you.  They could absolutely tell you to get bent.,419

That's the problem. On average, you are going to be filling at prices that are further from optimal the wider the bid/ask spread is, all else equal.

* A call is not synthetically the same profit/loss as shares. That may be considered an advantage of calls, but if your goal is to have a 100% synthetically equivalent position for P/L, calls alone can't do it.

* Shares are 100% intrinsic value all the time, regardless of share price. Calls acquire intrinsic value only when the share price is above the strike.

* Calls expired, shares don't.

* Shares can pay dividends, calls can't (although arguably the future value of dividends is discounted from the price of the call).

* Long shares can add to buying power, long calls don't. Similarly, long shares can be marginable, long calls can't.

* Calls are limited to standardized 100 share lots. You can trade smaller lots of ETFs, and with a fractional share broker, you can trade ETFs in dollar amounts instead of shares.

* Calls have time value, shares don't. But that also means shares aren't exposed to decay of time value.

* Liquidity of shares is almost always far better than liquidity of options. Volume can be orders of magnitude smaller for calls, and bid/ask spreads can be 10x or more worse than for shares.

* Not all ETF shares have calls.",425

"Well, if you're not great at options pricing, maybe stick to ETFs unless you want your portfolio to end up like the awkward third wheel on a date with long calls and cash.",425
Fundamental reason?  Theta decay . . .,425
"I'd seek to manage that leverage to maintain the exact same market exposure as I have currently.  This would free up most of my capital, which would collect interest as cash in a money market.

If shit hits the fan, and the devaluation of my synthetic position leaves me underexposed to future market movement, I would use the cash reserve to purchase more calls until I am correctly exposed.  Likewise I would sell calls and accumulate cash if my synthetic position gained value and left me overexposed.",425
You’ll lose less on deep itm calls than you will in stock if the stock falls to the strike price and you’ve got the option of rolling the positions forward.,425
"If you have the discipline to stick to that, Then this is a good idea. 

The only downside then is: a synthetic has an expiration. If the stock doesn't perform by that time you're out of luck. With buy and hold you can hold as long as you want.

Ps a synthetic and a long call are two different things, do realize that!",425
"> It doesn’t make sense why you would exercise so soon with a lot of time value still left.

Are you sure there was a lot of time value left? You didn't state the expiration, so I can't look it up to confirm.

While a mistake is possible, I would put it towards the bottom of the list of likely explanations. At the top I would list zero time value, but you claim that isn't true. Next on the list would be the net of the remaining time value and the cost of carry for the contract crossed the threshold where exercise was more cost-effective than holding.",426
"Deep ITM puts generate cash when exercised.  If 1 nights risk free rate is > than time value you will be assigned.

I've done this just to be a dick. If I'm going to buy a hundred shares and the cost isn't much difference and I'm having a bad day I'll exercise an option to make myself feel better knowing someone just lost their shares. Always gives me a chuckle,426

">I got assigned early this morning when DIA was trading at $353 and some change.

You didn't get assigned early this morning.  Exercises and assignments are processed overnight.  You got assigned based on the decision of a long to exercise yesterday afternoon.  The relevant factors are: what DIA closed at yesterday (353.32) and the closing bid/ask of the 12/1 360p.  The 360p didn't trade at all yesterday, and I don't know if it's possible at this point to find out what its closing bid/ask was.",426
someone wanted out of the stock and used the ejection seat that they paid to have installed,426
"I figured out the solution to my problem, I’m just simply going to trade SPX instead.  Tired of worrying about assignment, dividend risk etc. SPX is cash settled and no risk of dividend or assignment.",426
"Because whoever owned your options was going to make a profit by exercising them?

How? We will never know without asking the exact person.",426
It's really the risk-free rate you receive vs the value of the same strike call.  By exercising the put and buying the call you have the equivalent of just the long put.  If this interest you receive/not pay is more than the call it's a good early exercise (and there won't be any extrinsic value in the puts if this is the case),426
"Shhhh, don’t tell him. Let him keep his winning strategy. 🥸",426
Lol you gave me a chuckle sir,426
"The market maker made the risk free rate on a riskless transaction by selling the option, buying the stock, and then exercising immediately.",426
"The main thing that matters here is where the Dec 1 360 *call* is trading.  This will determine whether the 360 put should be exercised early.  By exercising the 360 put and buying the 360 call, the trader will have an equivalent position (short stock + long call = long put).   By exercising the put, the trader will be saving/making just over $5 in interest per day.  The cost of the call is currently .08, so it makes sense to exercise these early.",426
"Yep, thats the move",426
No shit.  Keep selling ITM options below parity.,426
"Like other stats in options delta is a calculated estimate.  Brokers and website may use differing formulas and inputs which will result in this variety.  Delta will also change by the minute, so there will seldom be the same number across sources.

What I do is choose one data source to make consistent decisions and think this is the best we can get.",427
"Depending on bid/ask spreads, they may be estimating different option value, which is then used in calculating delta.
But more importantly, ToS is usually wrong as it doesn’t consider dividends and doesn’t calculate forwards properly, if at all. ToS also assumes some static interest rate like 5.5%, but it’s not the actual or implied interest rate used in pricing options, especially at different maturities. For this reason ToS also shows totally wrong instant riskless profit on some LEAP SPX calendars, which cannot be possible.
I’m assuming that if Robinhood shows the same values then it’s just as wrong. Don’t know about StreetSmart but anything that’s different from ToS may be more correct.",427
"The usual reason for this discrepancy is that one quote is real-time and the other is delayed. Or you may also have differing delays, like one is 15 minutes and another is 20 minutes.

If you are sure they are all on the same delay/real-time schedule, there may be slight variations in the 2nd or 3rd decimal for different trade-offs in the calculation of the greek. Like if they are both using a binomial model, one might use 30 steps while the other might use 100.

You didn't say how large the discrepancies were, so hard to judge.",427
How off are the deltas? Do Vols differ between the platforms?,427
"It is important to get the right interest rate and dividend assumptions, then solve for any residual yield. This should line up the call and put IVs. They should not be different!

Also, the time to expiration should be decrementing as the trading day passes. We start at 95% of the current day and decrease down to 5% by the end of the trading day. 

When calculating greeks, a smoothed IV curve should be used. This way the negative effect of wide bid ask spreads can be minimized. 

I suspect it is one of these three issues.",427
"I couldn't quite understand what you're comparing, but model prices/greeks between SPY options and options on ES futures will not be the same. For one SPY options are european style and can be exercised early.",427
"Just looked and it's about about .012 off. ie Robinhood is showing the Delta as .1275 and Streetsmart shows .1158 for the $425P. I'm pretty sure both are real-time but I need to double check on Streetsmart.

It's not a huge difference but it changes some of the mechanics for the strategy I run.",427

"You'd make $13 on a buying power reduction of about $17k.  Assuming you can do that once a week, that's $676 per year on a principal of $17k.  That's a less than 4% APY.  There are savings accounts paying better than that right now.",432
"It largely can't go tits up, but I wouldn't call it printing money.  Your profit is $67.50 less fees for a 3 day hold, and you're putting up $19k in capital to buy those 100 shares.  Assuming zero fees, you're looking at .35% return, or 11.8% annually.

Can you get zero fees on both buying and exercising/assignment?

Edit: Wait, why is max profit different from net credit on that option strat?  Well, if it's only $14.50 that's not good... is it accounting for fees?",432
"This is effectively put call parity and you’re setting up the relationship to gain the implied risk free rate. If you somehow did spot a misprice, then you would have an arbitrage opportunity but those are rare and short-lived",432
"You are doing a version of a box spread. Typically it's done using a synthetic long and synthetic short. But instead - you are using a synthetic short and long shares.

This trade is setup to capture the risk free rate. But you are doing it with american-style options which isn't advisable because of early exercise risk.

The more common method is to use european style index options like SPX if you want to capture the risk free rate. Normally, you can capture about 100-250bps above the current 3 month t-bill rate.

It is also a lot more tax efficient to use a box spread than what you are trying to do with AAPL. And depending on your broker - it can be a lot more margin efficient in a pm account.

And if you can't do box spreads - just using a prime money market fund would be a lot simpler. And from what you presented - a mmf captures more yield at the moment.",432
"Your options are really just a forward and you get compensated for the cost of carry. The main risk is that one position can be exercised early, in which case it's no longer a forward.

"Seems like you’re almost setting up a box spread but using long stock instead of the synthetic long.  A long box is a synthetic long at a lower strike and a synthetic short at a higher strike.  You buy it for less than the width between strikes and at expiration it’s worth the width between strikes.  Try it on spx.  Then there’s no early assignment risk.  You basically get the treasury rate for whatever duration you pick.  It requires essentially no margin but you do have to put up the cash to buy it.  So if you were to buy more than your available cash, you’d start paying margin interest at a higher rate than the play was earning.  Usually you would do this while also selling options as that requires margin but brings cash into your account.",432
"This is basically long shares and a short synthetic. Meaning your position is hedged. The difference between put and call prices is because there is an expected return for the risk free rate.

That is essentially what you're making, the risk free rate - the spread - fees.

With these kind of strategies it's probably best to compare with buying a government bond.",432
"I think this is like a box spread, doesn’t work with American options and early assignment risks.

I know nothing at all about Jason Brown.  He may be good or he may not. But your supposition that if an options trader is successful he would not be on YouTube or teaching others is not always correct.  I am not on YouTube btw, but I have thought about it.  It’s not always about money when you have what you need.

Options trading is not easy.  It requires discipline and IMO good strategies with adjustments to be successful in the long term.  Most of my students have taken two years or more to learn to trade consistently.  Some never do because they don’t have the discipline to follow a plan and they think “this time is different” and they do something dumb.

Something that gets missed is that there is some trader on the other side of the trade and they are ""betting"" that the stock crashes so they make money.  You are ""betting"" the stock won't crash to collect some of that premium.  

LOOK at the chart!  It was just at $1.33 in July of 2022, then hovered below $5 for most of the time since then.

The IV will be diff for every strike at every exp, and how will you measure any meaningful change and what time parameter will you measure it by.... you will never be able to deduce a pattern, outside of during earning, the IV went up on all of them.  You can do this simply by pulling up a graph of IV on any good charting platform and looking at specific points in time on the graph.  Also, there are many other factors besides earnings that affect IV. Pricing models work backwards using stochastic calculus because we are dealing with random samples that can't be meaningfully differentiated like in traditional calculus.  The strike, underlying price, expiration, historical volatility, and interest rates all affect IV, which is calculated and then plugged back into the pricing model. Yes, earnings matter, but you are trying to isolate  one event and its effect on the demand (urgency to own)  a specific options contract.  The correlation may exist, but it is only one variable within a very complex mathematical process.",435

"The beauty of options is you can express any opinion you want. Not every structure has to be symmetrical. If you want to do a fly but have an opinion on the likelihood of a price going to a certain level but not exceeding it, you can express that however you wish. Nothing says one spread of a fly has to be the same width as the other spread. Maybe some stock is trading for $90 and I’m fairly confident it’ll get up to $100 in the next month but I don’t think it’ll go much past that. Maybe the 90/100/110 fly is $2 but the 90/100/120 fly is $0. Maybe I’m willing to risk having my second long call be an extra $10 out of the money to reduce the premium. Point is, there’s no one size fits all. Any opinion anyone wants to express is possible.",436
"I trade butterflies fairly often, but broken wings only rarely. BFs are good for their high risk/reward ratio; ie, they're cheap and they pay big. Their downside is there are two ways to lose: 1) not getting to the target price and 2) shooting past it. The underlying price has to fall within the ""net"" of the high and low legs of the fly to profit. A BWB is a BF modified to deal with problem #2. It basically combines the potential rewards of a butterfly with the safety of simply being right on a directional trade. If the price overshoots the spread, you still make a (smaller) profit.

For example, you're pretty sure AAPL is going to hit $200 next Friday? By all means buy a BF with $200 as the center strike. But if you think there's a good chance it will go even higher, then buy a BWB instead and collect profit if it falls within your spread without risk of losing if it exceeds your spread. 

So it's definitely a specialty trade  you should only be making when the specific conditions warrant. No way is it a trade to base some general strategy on.",436
"I prefer OTM calendar positions. 

I used to do butterflies but they are harder to fill and now there are no brokers with a $0 commission cost. Those extra options cost to trade. I think it's better to eliminate some positions. 2 option trade is way easier to fill and half the commission cost",436
"I'd suggest that you compare it to ICs as both structures can accomplish delta-neutral setup, while Credit Spreads cannot.

Their benefit over ICs is the reduced number of legs:   
The less you transact the lower your fees (commissions + slippage) will be.

The less legs can also be problematic sometimes:   
It's easier to come up with a delta neutral setup using multiple legs (greater granularity).",436
"BWBs are decent to leg into if you're into that. You start with a spread and then ""close it"" by completing the fly and locking in profits, although you also get the body of the fly as a possible home run if it lands. I think tastytrade has some info on this strategy as one of their core members is partial to it. That being said, I don't do this as I don't think it's worth the management and prefer to trade standard flys.",436
"My personal mantra is simple is better. There are so many complicated strategies, but they are hard to manage. I would even stay away from iron condors. They can work, but oh so easily become tricky and you make big losses.",436
I love broken wing butterflys. I play it more like a directional trade. I bet the price stays +- from where I open but have a „failsafe“ in the direction i think the price is heading.,436
Like all set ups they have their time and place. They are nothing like an iron condor or credit spread so I really wouldn't compare them. I use them occasionally on earnings plays when the vol is high and I can put them on for a nice credit. My delta setup usually something like 5 delta/2 10 delta/20 delta.....Say you put it on for 30cents and your risk is $5. Sounds horrible and it is but you are usually more than 2 standard deviations outside the expected move with the chance of a big winner if it gets to your shorts (don't count on this)....Often I will play them on the call and put side to take in more credit....They are a low risk. high prob trade,436
"They are higher probability of profit strategies versus verticals or iron condors. I enjoy the naked iteration, ratio spreads. I don't do much BWB's.",436
"A BWB is a long spread combined with a short spread of unequal width. They can be used for short-term directional trades, where the short spread reduces the cost of the long spread. Generally you want the underlying to move toward the short strike, ideally at expiration.

Alternately they can be used for credit collection and you want the underlying to stay away from the short strike and you keep the initial credit. The long spread offers insurance against a quick move toward the short strike but you give up some premium. I find that plain credit spreads work well enough on their own. The real payoff for the BWB comes from hitting the short strike at expiration, but that rarely happens.",436
"Have you even read [Positional Option Trading](https://www.amazon.com/Positional-Option-Trading-Wiley/dp/1119583519?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=thetatitans-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=70ad9782f307a00e6197f5bf84596fa4&camp=1789&creative=9325)?

"There is no December 17 expire next month. 

Other than that I would trade closer to the money on such a low vol stock.",439
"Dubious idea. SBUX is currently trading above all three of its major SMAs (50, 100, and 200) and would need to fall below every one of them in order to hit 95.

SBUX rose significantly after an earnings beat on 11/12. The tide would have to change drastically for SBUX to fall enough (~ 7%) to reach those 95 strike puts (pre- earnings level) by Dec. 15 (?). Meanwhile, Theta/time decay will continue to whittle away at the value of those Delta 5 or so options as they draw closer to expiration. (Selling that put is actually more promising than buying it, but (low) premiums and such make that idea a nonstarter.)",439
"I don't mean to hurt your feelings but I think you might want to read a few books about this. ""In the money"" means the strike price is below the price of the stock at the time the call option is purchased. This among other factors reduces the theta.  This time of the year is traditionally bullish for the market so shorting anything that has been trending positively is a bad idea. Good luck to you.",439
"Not at this time. Price still needs to test $102. There is support there. The bears and bulls will have a battle at $102 down to $95.66 if you ask me. Breaking below $95.66 will also be tough. I don’t see it happening before Dec 15. I’d expect a new high in SBUX before a break below $95.66 even. Of course I could be wrong. But this is how I interpret the price action.

Edit: looking at chart again - I don’t see much chance of price getting to $95 over the next 3 weeks. That would require three heavily bearish weeks in a row probably but the momentum is up and a pullback is just beginning. The pullback or “dip” will likely get bought up especially if it gets as low as $96. I’d bet that $95 strike 15 Dec calls expire worthless. Just a bet though. I would not sell the $95 15 Dec put options either however. Just don’t think the premium is worth the risk.",439
"lol I love how no comments on this post are even aware of the looming strike Starbucks is dealing with

Yes puts will payout",439
Never buy puts unless it's part of a spread. You lose time value every day and the stock probably won't drop fast enough in less than a month. Only sell puts when you are willing to buy the stock at the strike price.,439
[MarketPilot](https://www.marketpilot.ai/single_view/1/SBUX/) is saying SBUX is more likely to tap $115 than $95 in the next few weeks. I’d hold off and maybe get the puts in mid Dec depending on how things look.,439
Thank you for the insight. Something closer to the money better? $97 or $99? Any moves i should be looking at instead rn? Thanks a ton,439
SBUX looks like a buy at the level it is.,439
😂😂😂,439

isn't he buying puts tho?,439
Thanks! Im learning!,439
Strike. Yawn. Its not a nationwide strike. The market knows. Look at the price of the stock. Nobody here mentioned it because its a nothingburger.,439
Natenburgs book has a chapter on forecasting volatility. Basically he says IV is correlated to recent realized vol and realized vol will revert to the mean. So look for trades where realized vol is significantly different from the long term average.,440
"If we want to know what vol will be tomorrow, look at what it was today. In short, this captures the tendency for volatility to cluster. Overall, there is no realistic way for a retail trader to accurately forecast vol better than what we can imply from prices. 

I've connected w/ Euan Sinclair several times on this precise topic and even he mentions how he does attempt to forecast vol but it's more for an exercise than something he'd actually use. There are teams of PhD's with the sole purpose of forecasting, it's very difficult for us to compete with their estimates. 

In general though, you can plot IV and HV for various timeframes and use that to forecast easily and relatively effectively - obviously not perfect at all but again, what it was today is what it's likely to be tomorrow. So if we see a large gap between IV / HV, it's more likely that it would continue. You can also create moving averages to track the relationships.",440
"Can one consistently forecast future volatility?

Highly unlikely.

Can one discern trends & patterns in direction of implied volatility, IV Vs RV, or movements along the curve?

Certainly.",440
"People use all sorts of things to estimate volatility. Every market is different and so it really comes down to the nuances of a specific market and your ability to have a better prediction than that market. As for your second point, you would never enter a market to engage in volatility trading if you weren’t sure you could estimate better than the aggregate market. Whether your edge comes from deep knowledge of time series statistics or twenty years of market expertise, if you don’t have an edge in predicting volatility, you wouldn’t be advised to trade volatility. It’d be the same thing as someone with no edge in picking stocks deciding that stock picking is going to be their strategy. Wouldn’t make any sense.",440
"> Do people use models to predict the hidden standard deviation like time series and stuff like that?

People use models to forecast volatility, yes, but I don't know what a ""hidden standard deviation"" is.

> What makes you think you can estimate volatility better than the market, whose collective pricing determines IV.

That is an excellent question that would take too long to explore fully. Suffice to say, the market is not a monolith. There are factions within the market, where some factions are optimistic, perhaps ""irrationally exuberant"", and others are pessimistic. One faction or another may dominate the spot price at any given time. If that faction turns out to be wrong, an opportunity is created. This arises because reasonable people can differ on how to interpret public information.

> What happens if I just use the IV value? Would I make less money, would my bets even out in the long run making no money?

That's the same thing as giving up on trading vol forecasts. Instead of X vs. Y, you assume X is equal to Y. So any talk of how your bets would work out is moot, because you decided not to play the game at all.  You're playing a different game.

> More generally, someone said in my previous thread the field is adversarial and to a good degree it is a zero sum game. I think this is why the discussions, tools and available information tend to be a bit vague.

Correct observation, wrong conclusion. Discussions/tools/info are not vague. Perhaps they only *seem* vague because you have a preconceived expectation of certainty? It's fundamentally a game of probabilities, so if you are looking for certainties, you will be disappointed.",440
"Simple put, volatility is where the edge is. 

1. Yes
2. Most people can't. Collective pricing is the market buying and selling based on demand, models, etc. Most brokers will show you the IV value that will produce the current market price for a contract when plugged into the Black Scholes Model, but there are many other models out there. BSM is just the most common and most accepted.
3. Trading on IV alone is the equivalent to trading with just the quoted price if you are using BSM. (not exactly, but I don't think that's your point in this question)
4. Yes, options are zero sum. One side must win and one side must lose, but some market actors expect to lose (hedging), some use complex positions where they don't care about price movement, so if you are trading only on direction their actions may not be adversarial to yours or even create opportunities for you. However, yes, at the end of the day its all 0.",440
"Yes. I have been using forecasts since having a market making group on the Cboe in the 90's 00's. We had a way of calculating HV using tick data and we used that to make forecasts.

At ORATS, we continue to use forecasts. We publish the r squared for each stock for forecasts of implied and historical volatility. 

We calculate forecasts of slope and derivative (skew kurtosis) as well as earnings effects.",440
"There are models for volatility, search for garch.

It's easier to forecast volatility than price, but still it's not easy to forecast vol. However if you assume that volatility is mean reverting then you can have an angle to trade. That's why IV rank and iv/hv are useful indicators",440
"Some time ago, I did some exercises using variance estimation from garch models, although the variance of the model is highly correlated to IV (mainly because of the autoregressive term) it misses a lot of the time when predicting... I could not find a good sign using it, at least for selling and buy vol with ATM options. Although, that search was not exaustive maybe I missed something. There are lot of thing you can tweak, I used daily observation and did not used the different models for the variance (there are a lot you can do here). You can also change the moneyness of the options. 

Note: writing the backtesting code was not simple.",440
"I'd read this [book](https://www.amazon.com/Positional-Option-Trading-Wiley/dp/1119583519?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=thetatitans-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=70ad9782f307a00e6197f5bf84596fa4&camp=1789&creative=9325), it has a good piece on forecasting volatility.",440

Good point; in order to compete you need to believe you're going to win. I guess one needs to take a good look at their statistics to see if they are actually good at this.,440

"To avoid pdt rules you must trade futures options or wait 1 day in-between purchase and sale. For 0dte vertical spreads, your only option is to let them expire, or take a day trade. You only get like 3 or 4 of these day trades until pdt classification.",441

"You collect the premium when you open a credit position.

But you certainly could take profits after 1 hour, if indeed you had a profit.",441
"Yes, you can do that and most 0 DTE trades do do that. The only 0 DTE trades I'd expect NOT to do that and instead be held through expiration are credit spreads on index options, like SPX Iron Condors, because those are defined-risk and cash-settled.",441

"My understanding is that they make their money mostly by having people fail the test.  


If you pass the test and get funded the restrictions are pretty bad and no obviously you can't just buy and hold -- this is for active traders.

These thing are generally consider scams -- technically they are not because they actually honour the agreement but the terms are just such that it is designed to make gullible people think they are getting an opportunity when really they are getting a terrible deal.",442
"Opportunities? You mean advertisements? 

Man whoever heads up these marketing psy-ops would be so proud of themselves to read this post. 

Im sorry I wish you the best man.",442
"they generally place restrictions on what you can/can't do with their money, and that usually includes just buying and holding  


they're either;  
a) scams  
or  
b) looking for active traders who can beat buy and hold on a non risk-adjusted basis",442
"Im a funded trader in two different prop firm.

Generally there is restrictions not to hold overnight due to margin requirements. They say it's to prevent one from holding overnight but in reality, it's because their margin requirements become higher for brokerage. 


They will liquidate it at certain time before future market closes and its 0.2 ms which is what brokerage offers as fastest response time. 

So prop firm is only useful for specific needs, namely you dont have 25K to overcome PDT rules but you wanna day trade. 

Future is not applicable to PDT rules but it may blow up your account severely if you dont know how to cut at loss. 

I made pass in eval within 6 weeks but then i screw up in one day so i restarted and as soon as i pass eval, i become jabbing with MES, not ES. 

Some prop firm come with higher fees so if anyone wants to do, please take a look at their FAQ especially fine print. You have to read it as if you are reading test.",442
"I wanted to try this so I did a lot of research around them, most will only allow you Covered Calls in name of selling, for naked buying they will put on like 5% max risk for the day which is ridiculous cause an option can move 20-30-50% in a minute, their test challenge fees are high and they don't even give a real account for that so they are not risking anything and as 90-95% people will fail those challenges they make money from those.

Also according to FINRA regulations for an options funded account you will have to deposit money with them and they will provide you like 5-6x margin on buying and CC. One broker I know is Alkaline, they offer 6x margin on option buying, minimum deposit is $2k but their platform fee is ridiculous, it's $297 something + additional monthly charges totalling up to $100-150 and the brokerage you will pay. One will probably wipe out their capital on the first day with that kind of leverage in option buying, not worth it unless you have years of experience and profitability.",442
Is anyone who is behind these offers lurking in this sub? I would love to hear the reasoning behind the offer. I’ve never understood why so much effort is put into promoting it.,442
Nobody will let you loose their money for free!,442

"1) correct

2) the restrictions arent pretty bad, they are similar to the evaluations except they usually add on a windfall provision (ie, you lose money 95% of the time, but you slapped on 10 NQ and got lucky)

3) scams, ponzi schemes, etc but what they allow is people who dont have significant capital to get make money if they are decent at intraday trading.  You can get funded for $200-$500 bucks and if you blow it you can walk away.  A similar type of exposure would net you a five figure loss. In addition, most allow multiple accounts so you can compound.  

Its all futures contracts, no options. Or I havent heard of one that isnt only futures.",442
Opportunities. I love that look,442
You get more money from the people that pay you and fail than you lose from paying out winners. If a trader proved their profitability to your liking you could also copy them to the real market and you still get to keep your cut.,442
Any broker that offers conditional orders should allow this. A lot of them don’t like the liability of parking conditional orders on their servers when they can just route to the exchange and allow them to deal with it.,443
"If you could, what happens when a single abnormally low trade occurs (i.e. I enter 404 instead of 440)?  The trade gets filled immediately and trips your Sell Call activity.   

This seems like a risky proposition, and by not caring about the premium, you are reducing any buffer you might have had based on the premium received.",443
TD Thinkorswim which is now Schwab will,443
"ToS/Schwab will, but be forewarned the visual line of where underlying has to be for option to fill moves around a lot.. nature of options.",443
Better to set an alert instead with your option info so you can manually put the order in because your fill price might not be what you are expecting.,443
"Plenty of brokers allow that. I would imagine most or all of them other than the ""free"" ones.",443
"my broker does. theyre not techincally orders though. theyre conditional orders. which means they dont go to the exchange until the condition is met. wihch has consequences for the execution order. you wont really notice that on liquid stocks though.

Why would you ever want to do that though? It means you would buy/sell regardless of option pricing. If you could set a limit order then maybe it makes sense otherwise you're just donating money to market makers.,443
"> Are there any brokers who allow you to set a buy or sale of options based on the price of the underlying? 

Yes. For interactive brokers, this is called a conditional order type.

https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/trading/orders/conditional.php

> Example: I want to sell a call on SPY with a strike of $440, but I only want to do it when SPY falls below $435 and I don’t care about the premium. I just want to sell a call OTM at a specific strike in an effort to expire worthless. 

You should care about the premium just to make sure you don't get a terrible price. You can use an option pricing model to price what the option should be worth when SPY falls below $435. Compute that option price, modify it slightly to make it marketable, and then you can have a limit order that won't fill at a terrible price.",443
"Option action? More like laugh-ption action! 🤣 Who needs premium when you have Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V and a good sense of humor am I right?

"I don’t understand why this is a liability. I can understand wanting to offload responsibility, but I don’t understand what makes this a liability.",443
"As long as the option order isn't market, the options prices may not reflect that quick of a change in the price, and wouldn't trigger.",443
"Yes, the way I know is in ThinkorSwim.  Go to ""Order Rule"" after you select your option buy/sell.  In the ""When"" tab, select ""Mark"" (this is the stock ticker price).  You can then choose as to whether your options order executes below, at, or above whatever stock price you choose.",443

If you have the capital to do this you don’t need to ask this question…,445
"I believe the Options Clearing Corporation has position limits that are enforced pretty strictly.

"You probably wouldn’t do it all at once, you would do it slowly over time, via selling puts, and acquiring shares. Then you do a ‘hostile takeover’

If you tried to do it all at once, the options would get progressively more expensive.",445
"Let’s look at Tesla, you would have to purchase around 3 million calls to have about 10% if I have done my rough math properly. I haven’t looked at what is out there but that should give you a rough idea.",445
"It’s a moot point if you don’t have the capital to hold the hundreds of thousands of shares after exercising the calls. And if you have that much money, you’re probably not using options to acquire a company to begin with",445
"Is there such a thing as “calls available”? Buying and selling a call is a contract between two people betting on the price, so theoretically an unlimited number of people can sign an unlimited numbers of contracts and make an unlimited number of bets. The ones who lose will pay those who win. But more importantly, options are priced based on demand so the more calls you buy the higher the price, until you may be paying nearly as much for the calls as the price of the shares, making calls redundant. And as the price goes higher many sellers would be happy to sell you extremely overpriced calls. If enough shares are available then likely everyone would sell you their calls until you end up with all the calls and shares you want, but no one else will buy them from you. This probably was actually happening 20+ years ago on the trading floor.",445
You could never buy enough calls to have a significant share of the company because not every shareholder sells options on their stock,445
"Some portion but not more than you could get with normal purchasing. 

Beyond shares outstanding, you’d still need to have people who own the shares to sell the calls for you to buy in the first place- so even if you bought every available contract, you’d only have a small fraction of the shares outstanding.",445
"There are TECHNICALLY unlimited contacts available.  They are simply contracts between two parties based on a promise to fulfill a buy or sell of 100 shares of a stock. So there's no floated shares of contracts life with an actual company.  However,  the OCC would enforce position limits as they are stuck holding the liability of a counterparty cannot deliver shares or buy yours. Additionally,  if buying millions of contracts (or selling for that matter)you would definitely attract regulatory scrutiny as it would create high gamma risks and force marketmakers to skew the market by hedging sold contracts (or force them to forgo hedging,  lol).",445

"I'll have my Jeeves fly the private jet to my accountants villa, so he can get this question figured out.",445
"You don't have to own any shares of a company to buy or sell options on their shares. If you exercise your options, you're owed those shares by the OCC & they will do what they can to deliver them, including borrowing shares from willing lenders. That's why ETFs are so popular these days - the underlying securities are loaned out by the Fund to organizations like the OCC, earning a profit on the securities *and* facilitating the ability to trade those securities at the same time.",445
Back in the day didn’t Warren do this with companies to get to 10 percent ownership. He sold a shit ton of KO puts.,445
There's a limit to the number of contracts that can be sold for any given security.,445
"first of all thats a lot of text to say youre doing straddle/strangle with a long call. I also dont see how you think these ""protect"" you. Granted that if you shoot past your long strike you'll have maximum loss.

ps. you have no downward protection in this strategy. if vix drops to 9 youre basically fucked. now ofcourse youll say that wont happen. but then i invite you to look at vix between 2011-2016.

i agree with you that the call side is the most dangerous of the vix, because when the shit hits the fan vix can shoot to 60-120 almost overnight. but this isnt a riskless trade. youll fetch pennies and still have a sizeable risk on the call side depending on the distance between calls.

Vix options are also priced differently than normal options. They're usually priced after the vix term structure. which has a time-premium baked into it. youll have to see with actualy examples with realtime rates how much of a credit youre actually getting vs your max loss. i suspect the ratio to be less favorable than you think.",446
"What strikes or delta are you selling? 

How many DTE? 

What's the max loss vs credit collected? 

Is your long call the same DTE as your short positions?",446
"without strikes and expirys there’s no making sense of this trade but i’ll take a stab:

Dec. 19-
sell the 12p,
sell the 15c,
buy the 18c

that’s like 44 bucks credit per combo, with lots of risk seeing as VIX is at 12.50ish tonight, and selling 100 of those combos would only yield $4400 ish for the next just less than a month. 

To get the yield he’s claiming he’d have to be selling 500 or more and sitting on 3/4 of a milly in collateral or margin. 

sell wider legs only means way less premium and way more to sell. VIX seems wildly mis-priced these days and i’d love to see the OP clarify the legs of this alleged trade. It seems totally nuts and tragically risky seeing what the vol shorts crowd have demonstrated they’re capable of.",446
"Depending on the deltas you have selected, it's basically a straddle/strangle with a long call. as u/MrZwink mentioned. and looks like you will end up with long deltas in this trade, through the call. the other two legs are delta-neutral. 

The long call will eat away at theta on a daily basis. In VIX or VXX the risk is on the upside. i.e. when the market falls, volatility jumps up, so the short put is a good trade when it's this low, around 14ish. I wouldn't do the long call. I would either trade just the short put or a delta neutral strangle.",446
"Edit: I’m thinking of VXX. 

The obvious is that we run into a crazy bull rally and VIX crashes and you get left buying shares of VIX with no bottom. You’re only insuring one side of the trade. The other thing is your misconception that VIX has a floor of $12. VIX constantly reverse splits when it gets too low so there’s never a real bottom. So worst case VIX absolutely crashes, reverse splits, and keeps falling and now you’re bag holding shares until you decide to take the loss on the shares or up the number of CCs you sell or adjust the strike to ITM to try and minimize the loss. You say if the market goes down it’s good, but if you’re straddling and selling a put, than that put is going to go ITM quick.",446
I think this strategy is called Jade Lizard. Can you elaborate on deltas and DTEs?,446
"This strategy assumes a directional trade because you're technically building out a vertical call spread and a short put. If the vix falls, you'd be risking too much capital to be balanced.",446
"Wow, you must have some serious luck or insider knowledge to be making that kind of money with the VIX straddle strategy!

25k 4.07%

50k 3.56%

75k 4.76%

100k 5.03%

Just looking at those numbers it’s obvious it’s difficult to get funded. The second bit of information from those stats would likely suggest that the lower the account the more leveraged a trader gets. Ie trading Minis instead of micros thus leading to more failures.",450
"Never heard of one allowing options trading so not really sure the relevancy here. 

Almost every other trading sub is flooded with these nauseating prop firm discussions, I hope the trend doesn’t continue here.",450
Where's the part where anybody got scammed out of any money you illiterate prosimean?,450
"So your complaints are:

1) trading is hard

2) they dont use real money in funded accounts which is noted on their website

“We use live data for performance accounts. Initially they are in SIM but you still get paid the same way this is because many traders may blow a performance account quickly. So this is done to protect the company and you as a customer. One we see consistency we copy the trades via api in a prop account. 

Once we see long term consistency you are placed into a live prop account”

Every prop firm has a similar setup. Not sure your motive here but you havent actually pointed out anything.",450
"People get paid for real from this platform that’s the most important point, whether you are the sucker that’s another different story, since at the very least they delivered according to the mutually agreed conditions.",450
Apex eventually starts copying your trades with real money. TradeDay has the option to trade sim but eventually moves you to a cash account or gives you the option to start with a cash account. Prop firms usually aren’t scams most people just suck at trading,450
"Trading is not easy what? So you expected to be a new trader and make money through apex with 0 experience in trading.

Go play your own money in the markets and see how fast you eat your words back.",450
"...I just received $2000 in real USA dollars. Yes, they are sim accounts with no real access to the market, I just think of it like a Poker tournament, with prop firms you get paid from guys blowing their evaluation accounts, house keeps the difference.",450
They don't immediately trust you by giving a live 100k account? They make you prove yourself? What a scam!,450
Sounds like you didn’t wanna do the learning and they wouldn’t fund you and now your feelings are hurt. Go get a box of tissues and binge watch something on Netflix instead,450
You don't know what scam means,450
"OP has some sort of personal vendetta going on some crazy accusation. I don't doubt there are folks trying to spam affiliate link but that doesn't mean Apex is fake.

Apex has some flaws and are not perfect but they do certainly pay out. I know a number of people who have received actual payouts to their account.",450
"I did four withdrawals with them. 1st $2,750 and the other 3 were of $15k each. Almost 50k in about three months. I dont see the Scam. 
Of course, I put a LOT of work. I have failed a lot of evaluations accts. I dont go out the weekends and after my 10yrs old daughter goes to sleep I get off my bed and sit back in my little officce until I fell sleep studying charts. I am watching or listening to trading videos while I eat, shower, rest, work, drive and I only watch one or two movies on the weekends bcoz of my daughter. Is not easy!!! But the payouts are REAL!!!…. The work you have to put in trading needs to beyond 100%…..",450
Lol no it’s not. Not their fault you can’t read/trade. Also trading the evaluation leads to PA acct which you can take withdrawals from. Paper trading in your account does not do that.,450
Calls on NFLX?,450
"This is more common with futures, and you can have these cross-margined as a pair depending on the correlation. For example the crack spread, the crush or a simple NDX vs SPX. 

You’re describing equity pairs trading, but with options instead of underlying. Can definitely work, but nobody I’m aware of is setup to offer it out of the box on their platform.",451
"Sure, I do that with Interactive Brokers / their standard TWS platform. You can create option orders with legs on different underlyings.",451
"A spread is just two options bought or sold on the same order, but there is no reason you can't buy and sell any options from different stocks in separate orders.  It won't matter what it is named . . .",451
Also at TDA/TWS I often create linked “1st Triggers” orders so that first order execution triggers another (or multiple ones). You’d usually have to execute 2nd order at market price that will cause some slippage.,451
"You could theoretically do this with etf's, but you'd need higher option approvals as you may tecnically have naked postions (naked but hedged).",451
Futures is actually where I want to do it. But I was considering using futures options first.,451
But the exchanges don’t allow it so isn’t that just the platform legging it for you?,451
Awesome. I might have to learn to like IBKR. Going to try TastyTrade too at some point.,451
"This can certainly be executed as a spread if you are trading CME products.  Other exchanges may be different.  

Check out Trading Technology's platform.  It's designed for professional traders but is available to retail traders.  Not as cheap as the typical retail platform but worth the price if you are trading seriously.",451
Tastytrade has a pairs trader that allowed you do it with futures and stocks,451
"I’m pretty sure I can still do this in TDA with futures

You will have much better margin requirements with futures, to do it with options you will need portfolio margin for them to offset each other",451
"Yes, it is the broker platform.",451
"Curious how it works. You can enter a spread price, or do you have to do it at the market? I know how both of their orders are routed at the exchange level, and they are really fast and good, but if it’s a limit, it’s certainly possible that the could get filled on one leg and whiff on the other.",451
"I only created limit orders in such way (not market orders). Never ended up with a single leg filled but often ended up with my order executed after the prices already moved and my limit price no longer had an edge. But sometimes I’ve got nice near-arbs.. I’m assuming they do it the same way you’d do it yourself if you had to implement such algo. And I’d have a few ideas to test to go about this. At minimum you’d simply buy both legs at the market price after the price of both legs is within your limit.
IBKR also provides various execution parameters; like whether to guarantee or not guarantee the price, which leg to fill first, whether to use relative pricing to walk one of the legs, etc. So it’s like having a programmer that would implement various legging-in features for you, and then it’s up to you to try them all and decide what works best for you, if anything.",451
Awesome. Thanks for the color.,451
"Yes, that is exactly what happened.  Presuming your spread expired with both legs ITM then the short option was assigned for you to buy 100 shares at the strike price, then the long option was exercised to sell 100 shares at that strike price.  Since the strike prices were $1 apart and option contracts are multiplied by 100, $1 x 100 = $100 difference.  You bought 100 shares at $21 ($2100) and then sold 100 shares at $20 ($2000) for a loss of $100 minus the credit collected (which you didn't post).

The risk you do not seem aware of, or you would not have let the spread expire, is if the short option expired ITM and you were assigned 100 shares at a cost of $2100, but the long option NOT being ITM and expiring worthless.  In this case the long leg protection would have been lost with you holding the shares and have the risk of those dropping for a loss.  

It is good practice to not let spreads expire due to this risk so be aware for future trades as it can happen and cause losses not expected from a defined risk trade.  Many think a spread cannot lose more than the max loss, but this is not the case.",452
"Why are you doing spreads when you don't understand how they work?  And why'd you let them expire?

What was your credit on the spread?",452
Yes. Lost $100 (minus whatever you collected selling the spread).,452
"A lesson to learn from this trade is don't hold options through expiration. While you didn't explicitly say when the expiration was, I'm pretty sure it expired sometime Thanksgiving week. Am I right?",452
"I will disagree with others and commend you for doing a risk defined trade as you learn. That is EXACTLY what you should be doing so you can learn how to trade with some skin in the game and real market experience.  As you learn you will want to widen out those spreads for a more favorable risk/return.  One thing to check if you are not going to close before expiration is that your broker doesn’t charge you fees for assignment and/or exercise..

OIC where you said you wanted the shares, in that case you shouldn’t be selling a tight spread like that.  It’s important to know what outcome YOU want prior to putting the trade on, not just trying to figure it out after.  If you want the shares a cash secured put is what you want to sell.  If you want to trade options a spread is a good way to begin.",452
"Think of it as you received 100 shares ( assigned at $21 ) on your short put, then passed those down to the person who sold the $20 put that you purchased as insurance as part of your spread.  Net result for you, loss of something less than $100.",452
"Rule with Credit spreads : You have no business hold ITM short strikes into exp, They will be assigned if you hold into expiration. You must get out  prior to expiration . I would say that you should have bought them back for a profit on Wednesday when they were still OTM during the day when they were well above 21 . The question is why didn't you do that? I know you thought they would expire worthless. You were greedy thinking you could eek out that last profit on them . and you paid the price for your greed. This is the best thing that could happen -  now you  learnt the lesson, which is when you get to  80% of max profit -  take what the market gives you.

There is an old saying on Wall St ""Don't be  dick, for a tick""",452
"As someone who learned how you are id like to add - I knew about trailing and stop orders. What I didn't think about when I started, was how they apply to spreads. You have to maintain enough cash/margin to buy each leg so that you can make use of them. When things go against - cut losses, which are made up by the times things go for you. But say your up 30%, which isn't nothing but your balancing the times you go -20 before you can adjust. Maybe your losing a little if it goes down on the short side you bought, but now you can set a stop and (sort of) lock in say 15% while maintaining your upside and you don't have to think about it anymore, or for some people worry.anecdotaly, I've got a pretty bad record over the last month in terms of how I thought things would go but limiting my downside and having my upside open has made my 20/80 record into a 20% gain without any trade hurting me significantly. I'm not saying I'm good, I'm probably quite bad. I just follow the advice on here that seems like a good idea and listen to the people who a) say you should apply things to YOUR tolerances and b) people like buffet who say put your money in things you know",452
"Well, I guess when you said you needed someone to help you understand, you meant literally because now you need to find $100 more somewhere.

"I got $25 so that means it was a $75 loss, And I have now learned my lesson but my uneducated reason for letting them expire was because I thought I was going to just be assigned 100 shares which is fine with me because I want 100 shares.",452
Yes 11/24  expiration and I have definitely learned my lesson.,452

"If you wanted 100 shares and were willing to pay $21/share for them, there was no reason to pay for the $20 put and create the spread when you opened the position.  Using puts to lower your entry costs for shares you want to own is a smart way to boost your portfolio.",452
"What you need to know is that multi-leg option positions are concepts only.  ""Under the hood,"" so to speak, each of the legs is separate, and whatever happens with each one happens independently of the others. The reason you got assigned on the short 21 strike is that it expired ITM, so you were selected for assignment because all the long 21 strike puts out there were exercised.  The reason your long 20 strike was exercised is NOT that your brokerage deliberately exercised it for you because they knew you were getting assigned on the 21p.  It's that the OCC (the Options Clearing Corporation) exercises all long options that are ITM as of market close on the expiration date.  As long as your brokerage took no action, it was inevitable that it was going to be exercised since PLTR was below 20 at market close.

You could have contacted your brokerage and asked them to send a do-not-exercise notice, but that usually makes little sense since you should be able to get at least a couple of bucks back by selling it instead.",452
"VOO will likely never get weeklies or dailies like SPY. VOO is meant for buy & hold investors while SPY is meant for traders. Liquidity just isn't there. If you want to trade S&P 500 options, you go with SPY, SPX or (to a lesser extent) XSP. There is also IVV (iShares Core S&P 500 ETF) which has the same 0.03% expense ratio as VOO and has weeklies, but no dailies.",453
Spy liquidity in unchallenged for etf options on S&P…,453
"you are getting bad information. SPY is larger than VOO in terms of assets under management. SPY has about $400B whereas VOO has about $350B

There is no real volume of options trading on VOO. why would they introduce 0DTE for it.  there would be no market.",453
Why would options be affected by Expense ratio? The two etf tracks that the same things but people trading spy contracts are there for day trading and need the daily trading volume to be high. I don’t see why one group of people and trading tactics suddenly move to the other side with less trading possible and a buy and hold plan…. If it were to happen then the ER will go up more in VOO cause they might have to manage more day to day changes in volume and swings due to the new day traders… and SPY ER might go down for the opposite reason… again doesn’t really matter cause ER is still very low and only concerned only huge amounts of money over longer periods of time…,453

"> I see SPY has almost daily DTE options compared to weekly VOO DTE's

VOO has weekly options? Not according to my broker. VOO only has monthlies.

> Currently, VOO manages twice the asset than SPY for almost 1/3 the expense ration.

That doesn't have anything to do with the market demand for option contracts.

There is a ""first to market"" bias in option contract demand. SPY was the first S&P 500 ETP so it got all the popularity, even though arguably better ETPs came later. A similar situation happened with SPX and XSP. SPX came first and got all the demand. XSP was added later for people who couldn't afford SPX, and while it has weeklies, the demand never got close to SPX or SPY, so it's often overlooked, even though option contracts on XSP have a lot of advantages over contracts on SPY.",453

Unless you've done at least 1000 trades, you have no idea whether you've been successful or not. If you've only done this a dozen times or so, it's likely that your good results are entirely down to luck. The same thing would apply if you lost money on every trade. Could have been all bad luck.

> to supercharge my returns and goal being to outperform buy and hold

That is not possible without **also increasing risk**. Start thinking in those terms. Excess returns never come for free, so you should be honest with yourself that what you are really doing is adding more risk to your portfolio.

>  as well as reduce my volatility in the scenario of a market crash. 

You aren't really doing that. The hedge value of a CC runs out at soon as your shares lose more than the credit you received. If your CC pays $1 in credit, you have $1 of hedge. If you CC pays $6 of credit, you have $6 of hedge. If you calculate the percentage of share price the credit represents, like $0.43 / 470 in your example, you can only tolerate a 0.09% loss before your CC stops hedging.

> am surprised everyone seems to focus so much on 30-60 DTE.

There is a very good reason for that. A CC is a contractual commitment of your shares. While the CC is on, your shares are locked up in that contract as collateral. You can't do a thing with those shares while they are in a CC. Like if there is a strong rally only 3 months into your 24 month hold, you are shit out of luck. You can't sell shares to capture profit from that rally. Likewise, if the shares tank, you can't sell shares to harvest losses for tax purposes.

The 30 - 60 DTE expiration for CC comes from backtesting. Too short a hold time results in lower risk but for lower reward. Too long a hold results in too much risk for only modestly higher reward. So the sweetspot is somewhere between 30 to 60 DTE.

By using such a far OTM call in your CC, you are raising the ceiling on gains on your shares, which is a good thing, but the cost of that is a puny credit. You have to ask yourself, is that puny credit worth the cost of locking up your shares for that long a time? If you would never trade the shares no matter what happens, your answer may very well be yes. But then the logic of holding specifically NVDA would make no sense, since NVDA is not a buy & hold type of product, it's a trader's product for volatility. It's like buying a high performance race car to drive to Starbucks 2 blocks away. Also, since your goal is to reduce volatility, why would you want to reduce volatility on a stock that you buy specifically for its volatility?

Overall, a CC strat will underperform the market on 15 year averages. Any number of studies and backtests have shown that, such as [this one](https://spintwig.com/spy-short-put-strategy-performance/), with the observation that a CSP is synthetically the same as a CC for profit/loss.",454
"The problem with that is that if NVDA crashes down to $350, your -call is still going to be pretty expensive to cover. It will be sitting up there hanging over everything like a 1st quarter missed extra point.",454
"Issues include if there is a big crash the value of your underlying will fall by more than the premium you brought in most likely.  Then you have to face a decision.  Is it a short term crash you can ride out or did something happen which actually shook up forward looking outlook.  If the latter, you may find that the LEAP you sold is expensive still to buy back even though its disgustingly otm now.  Thing is it represents 2 years of time value and vol just spiked.  So you have a loss on your shares and have to buy this contract back.  Again this might not be an issue for you depending on outlook but this is where I start to get biased and find reasons my positions will bounce back.",454
"NVDA is not a good stock for options.  Neither is TSLA and others that have high volatility.  If you own these and have made good money during the run up, then congrats, but selling CCs on them is not a good idea.  You might sell that 2026 call for 850 only to see the stock run up to $1500 or more.

Using this as an example, you could sell 30-60 dte CCs which will decay faster and be reopened at a higher strike to follow the share price if it goes up.  You may also make 2X or even 3X or more of the $43 doing it this way.  I agree that weekly has more risk and not worth the hassle, but 30-60 is the ‘sweet spot’ of theta trading . . .",454
"I would stay away from calls that far away.  I personally like selling 30-45 days at about 15-30 delta’s depending on how close the stock price is to support.  Take 50% plus gains and sell a new one.  When a stock like VZ rises quickly breaching calls, I will roll out for a similar amount of premium and up the strike.  Now I have a cushion if the price goes down about 10%, or I lock in 15-20% ROi until it does catch up.  I am buy and hold.  NVDA is a pretty hard stock to sell covers, especially if the price gets breached.",454
"I'm long term holder of AMZN and GOOGL and I sell 1 yearly contract for every 115-125 shares at my target price (currently AMZN 185$ and GOOGL 180$), this way I collect extra cash and I keep 15-25% of shares in case of assignment, I will never sell CC under the target price no matter how high the premium and the iv are, maybe in future I will sell 30-45 DTE contracts when the stock get close to my target price",454
"This is the best quote: It's like buying a high performance race car to drive to Starbucks 2 blocks away. Also, since your goal is to reduce volatility, why would you want to reduce volatility on a stock that you buy specifically for its volatility?  


Why do people look at these sort of strategies on the biggest winning highflying stocks of the year? This is the same stock that was down 50% in 2022.",454
"Ok yeah makes sense, a huge volatility spike (compounded on such a long term time horizon) would indeed be a big issue",454
"I would argue that it is precisely these volatile stocks were you can cash in on nice premiums. Obviously the risk is higher of getting assigned but hence why in this example the treshold is almost +100% from current price and where i would be more than happy to sell at. If it really goes to $1500 well thats fine, i made enough profit already. But realistically i dont see $1500 as this would imply a $4 trillion market cap…

Agree though that the volatility would make a constant options strategy for income purposes more difficult to manage.",454
It's more an issue if you're the touch-your-portfolio type.  Based on your writeup it seems you might hold NVDA shares for next decade+ and just want to make money trading around it.  If you're truly long I don't see a huge issue other than capping gains if things got nutty.  But if you're good you just keep rolling for more credit indefinitely.  Not like NVDA is going to gap from 400s to 800 lmfao.  I can't claim to predict the future of AI nor its benefit to the gatekeepers however.,454
How could he have a loss on shares AND have to buy his contract back? What am I missing?,454
"Options are an exchange of risk vs returns . . .  The more risk the more the possible return, but also the more risk of a loss and drawdowns.  I’m an admittedly conservative trader so look for low vol stocks.

We all must trade within our personal risk tolerance, so do what you think is best for you and your account.  Just remember that NVDA has dropped $200+ in the past and it can do it again.",454
">Not like NVDA is going to gap from 400s to 800 lmfao

Not an overnight gap, no, but NVDA jumped over 100 pts in November.  Broadcom moved 500+ in 14 months.  Never say never, lol.",454
If the thesis changes... Papa Jenson retires and NVDA drops all chip/hardware/ai projects to enter the restaurant business... or China invades.  He can't dump his 100 shares until he rebuys the CC,454
That wasn't the point.  Gaps can't be rolled.  Grinds upward can be.  Roll up and out always and keep getting paid.  It's literally free money when the move is slow.,454

"I wish i simply bought AAPL and MSFT with tuition and forget about what to do (early 2010s)/and by now, i would have beee sitting in million and retired from work. 

Theta is only one of many variables in option and selling put is good in theory but if not handled properly,it wont beat return compared to the simple buy and hold on good stocks

Likewise, TSLA and ENPH would be my stocks if i could be simply early 20s again

If you must play with wheeling, look at more complicated strategy

I have had a decent profits this year when i buy shares with long put to gimme protection and sell covered calls with 2 naked calls (so 100 shares with 1 long put and 3 short calls)

If stocks are coming down, i sell ATM short put with an assumption of assignment. 

If stocks are going up, i buy OTM calls while considering to cover net 2 naked calls by buying 200 shares (probably wont buy at once)

This strategy will work only if it's good valuation. 

TSLA/ENPH could be good candidate but with how volatilite they could be, it may not be comfort zone for everyone

I got into the market a bit in life so don't have the time horizon for growth to truly benefit me, but if I could do it all over again at your age, I would value invest to grow my money as much as possible, then tun to selling options much later on in life to generate income against that (hopefully) substantial capital for a second income and/or into retirement.",459

"I wouldn't touch TSLA with a barge pole.

If you go back and look through the history of individual names in the stock market, you'll find some very large and well known household name companies (that have been quoted in the major indices) have gone to zero.

Stocks go up and down - as do the major indices, but with individual names there is increased volatility.

Do not assume that the next decade will look like the previous one.

Risk assets have been artificially inflated around the world because of unsustainable central bank easy monetary policies over the last 12/13 years; when this unwinds, equity owners could be looking at a very different investment climate/regime or landscape.

It has also been commented that we are living in the age of fraud.

Personally, if I am to buy and hold equity investments for the longer-term, I don't want to own anything that isn't backed by real assets; think of companies that should perform well in an inflationary environment (like the 1970s) and look for commodity, energy, and select real estate (backed) firms.  Solid utility companies can also offer defensive qualities, along with deep value opportunities.   These are not exciting or sexy firms in vogue, but if the wind changes direction, the high growth type stocks (and the most crowded trades right now) may be valued and perform very differently to how they have been doing.

Know your stock market history.

Take a look at the [GMO rolling 7-year quantitative forecasts](https://www.gmo.com/globalassets/articles/gmo-7-year-asset-class-forecast/2023/gmo_7yrforecasts_10-31-23.pdf) for US and foreign equity classes (including bonds) if you're not familiar with such, and if you blindly assume that equities are always going to yield positive returns (over a 5 to 10 year term).  It is worth taking a look at the Nikkei Dow 225 (from the late 1980s to the present, especially considering the policies the Japanese central bank pursued leading up to their 'lost decade' and comparing these to what has been happening more recently closer to home) and also the S&P500 from the mid-to-late 1960s, to get an idea of what can happen when markets dip, and how long they can take to recover - as investment cycles peak and bull market regimes climax, and bear phase cycles take over.   The Japanese investor who put their money into the market at the peak in 1989 is still underwater, and waiting for the market to recover to those dizzy heights. 

Be aware of what can and does happen when stock market cycles climax and investment regimes change.   Winter could be coming.",459

"I dont disagree with you and definitely future could go to your direction

But im in the camp of staying in central bank printing more money

Why? The unexpected consequences of mid 20th century in biological technology breakthru is that the expected lifespan has been significantly increased from average of 60s to now late 80s and early 90s

Now the second wave so called gene therapy and next generation cancer drug including cancer vaccines is on the way

This means.... Average lifespan will only go longer. If we get rid of cancer as #1 cause of death. US is different that the gun accident followed by narco abuse are primary factors not be able to benefit from this but even so, the well rich population still benefit from the new technology. In EU and advanced Asia, the average and median life span are going to direction to early 90s.

This is well beyond the typical retirement age of 65 about 20 years at least. This +65 old population can't find employment unless very lucky (or specific area. Ie lawyer) and can't generate profitable economic activity meaning that they are what's called socially vulnerable groups and its economically not viable to support them financially unless fed or central bank dont print the money. 

Im sure your parents have had uncomfortable time to financially support you ever since you are able to breath air outside of the womb for at least 20 years and now the government takes over financially responsibility on you for the same period of time

Sure this financial responsibility is not something your parents could have done like sending you private school/buying you apple iPad or sending you to study oversea but it still costs them money when fulfilling its duty such as providing basic healthcare/livable social security check/fixing roads and maintaining parks/etc

To simply put, due to biological tech breakthru, 30% of population in any given advanced economy is now liability, not asset in terms of financial statement for the economy, which needs constant temporary repair to fix as liability costs damage. 

Where does this money come from?... Central bank printing money, period. This money is what make big pension system along with 401K functional. 

For instance, California teachers pension will go to defunct if average rate of return is around 5% for 10 years in a row. So even if they are all in US treasury 5% which is the best yield it's been to since early 2000s, they will go to bankrupty.

I dont have specific stats for SSA but with most of us aware social security fund might be defunct in mid 2030s if early, i dont see much different story. 


Now.... In Democratic Republic like US and most of this advanced economy, it may be arguable whether constitutional power relies on constituent and voters but at the end of days, voters will choose leaders in government. 

I dont see how any government leader will try to touch this welfare budget to reduce deficit in democratic republic. If it's like Russia or China, it might be different story though because leaders simply may choose not care and send complaints to jail or something. 

If we are to cut government deficit and prohibit central bank from artificially infusing money, it is effectively death penalty to retirees, which is 30% of constituents, and therefore unless US changes Constitution, it's political suicide and therefore not gonna happen meaning Fed will simply release more credits to the market. 

And i see US stock markets might go to Japan's route but i believe US will go to different route. US is still the most advanced tech hub when Japan isn't. Japan hasn't adopted IT tech since late 1980s. You can see Japanese sending official document thru fax in today that i dont know where to send fax in US (i believe some Fedex and UPS might have fax machine here and there). If not sent via fax, you should visit the office. 

When's last time you hear about Japanese company leading industry other than Auto? Even in Auto industry, what's the Japanese version for TSLA model Y and 3 even when other major automakers like Korean Hyundai and German Volkswagen have? 

What other big Japanese ecommerce you heard or popular? 

None!

Japan still lives in 1980s with measle IT infrastructure and perhaps that difference will make the change when it comes to US equity markets. 

Sure this is only one example but that's why, after 3 decades of printing money, Japanese equity market dont benefit much. (I could go on more about Japanese population change vs US, how USD as a key reserve currency acts as a driver to boost equity market, how US geopolitical powers in the world provides buffer in case of emergency vs how Japan can't even influence other nations in diplomatic world/how political system is different between the two, all of which could explain why NIKKEI hasn't done well)

Now.... Going to individual stocks like TSLA. If one believe EV is ultimate future to transportation, so far TSLA is the most advanced in western world as opposed to BYD in China, who's been able to catch up in last 5 years

Within context of US-China relationship, this important perspective that US government wont let TSLA die as EV market is going to grow significantly. If so (that EV is strategic agenda for a nation like US), then it doesnt matter about valuation. 

Not saying TSLA will do 80X just the way AAPL did from 2009 to 2023 but saying that as long as TSLA delivers the promises of providing EV with comfortable price tags, valuation wont matter as it's part of national strategic agenda in the context of US-China

If TSLA dies off, then Chinese EV will likely take over the world, which is last thing US policymakers in DC wanna see.

Sure US/EU may impose tariff or protective measure against Chinese influence but 3rd world wont be able to and it will give victory for China to take upperhand in US-China context

The primary reason Beijing went to heavy in EV from the start is to overcome the hegemony of conventional ICE exclusive technology (engine/design/oil dependency) just like how E. Musk has his selling point about TSLA

If US/EU imposes tariffic to protect domestic market, they may be able to keep out Chinese EV but they have no choice but to accept that it's losing battle because China now has solid leading technology (all included with pricing)in transportation which is big picture of why EV market is so loud. 

Its hegemony battle between US and China, and TSLA is a leading candidate that represents US supremacy in technology in my opinion. I dont see how this could fail unless GM/Ford can come up with impressive technology. 

I think i touch too much but i dont disagree with your point. Look at CSCO. After dotcom bubble bust, it stays the same like 20 years ago when living expense is probably 1.5 times as one is bagholding 

Look at IBM thats combination of MSFT/GOOG in 1970-80s. Its still stable stock that doesnt give good return of rate. 

You seem to be in the camp that fed shouldn't print money and im not saying you are in the wrong camp but sometimes the camp doesnt matter. I have so many opinion that something should or should not happen but most of time my opinion doesnt matter

All im saying is one needs to be flexible and fluid when it comes to money",459

You bought during volatility rush and suffered volatility crush.,460
"NVDA announced earnings, which was the reason the options were priced at a large IV.  After earnings, the expected future volatility (for the rest of the option lifespan) is lower.  So the IV is lower.
For a detailed explanation look up IV Crush",460
"Oh boy: you have some expensive lessons ahead. I highly suggest you find a reputable course on options. Spend the money on education or lose it to the market (also an education expense, but this one is tax deductible in a way). May I suggest Nicks Inner Circle live trading room at Benzinga. You learn so much just in day to day trading conversations when you have someone that really knows their stuff and is happy to talk about it every day all day from market open to close. 

For example, one of the first things you should do in the morning (you should have a morning routine and checklist. If you don’t, make one this weekend) is check the VIX Volatility Index (anything over 20 is going to start to raise the IV on all options, which will in turn raise the delta which in turn raises the price which in turn increases the theta. Next you need to check for earnings reports for each of the stocks on your watchlist, but ALSO for earnings on others in the same industry. For example if AMD has earnings it will drive up the IV each day as the report increases, reaching a crescendo on the day of the report, but it can have a knock on effect on NVDA. Then you need to check on how the particular sector is doing in the SPDR, so for NVDA, it would be Technology which is XLK. If the IV is high there it will increase the IV of the many stocks it holds such as NVDA, APPL etc. you can read the news but seriously it’s worthless. Just know the times of government releases. That’s important. 

These are all ways of also being able to predict price action. If the XLK is down sharply it will often drag every stock in it. And other stocks will affect each other. Especially Apple. Typically in your day if you look at every chart of the big 7 along with SPY, at least one will be following the SPY almost exactly, and in fact can often be slightly predictive of what is coming by a few seconds. I’ll always call this stock the “truth teller.”",460
"It's called IV crush. premium is a function of IV (among other things). 

The 47% IV was probably before they announced earning. At the time, uncertainty was high, hence IV was high. Now that they announced the earning, there's no more uncertainty about the earning event so the IV dropped, therefore premium dropped.",460
Just look at your Greeks to approximate. Your delta was -.1 and you were long vol with vega of .28. The stock dropped 11 bucks so you gained $1.1 on your long exposure but IV dropped 10% so you lost $2.8 being long vol + you lost on the theta bleed. So net the contract should be down about 2 bucks.,460
"IV dropped and theta decay are both working against the position.  

The option is at 420 but the stock is around $487 so has to drop significantly and quickly over the next 6 weeks to offset the continued impacts of theta even if IV doesn’t drop more.

 Is your analysis that the stock will drop something like $67 in those six weeks?",460
>I'll look it up. Thanks,460
thanks for your detailed post and suggestion. I'll try to get educated,460
how does a 10% volatility drop equate to $2 in a $4 premium,460
"No. But I did not expect the option to halve in a day just because implied vol changed from 47 to 37.  The stock did go down afterall. And the delta was 0.10, the stock dropped more than $10, yet the put premium was selling for 1/2 price",460
"If you bought this as a spread i.e. buy 420, sell 410 or soemethint it wouldve helped to offset some of the IV crush, as well as theta",460
Forget courses. Read natenberg.  I haven’t found a single course that offers anything not found in that book.,460
"10% IV drop is a big number. Usually people use a formula called ""black-scholes"" for option pricing. To make it easier, there are online option calculators most of them are based on black scholes.

Here's one example: [https://www.barchart.com/options/options-calculator](https://www.barchart.com/options/options-calculator)

If you plug in the parameters you'll get the put option price around $2.3 when IV is at 37%. and the same option price is around 5.22 when IV is 47%. The prices are based on theoretical prices, but they tell you how much difference you can expect in a 10% IV drop.",460
"It depends on the Vega exposure of the option in question.For example for an option with a Vega exposure of .40, a 10% drop equates to $4.00 in premium.",460
"Cool! Right, forgot about that",460

Why stop loss options  orders behave in adverse unexpected ways, and are not such a good idea, except for the very  highest volume options.

https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/stop_loss",461
"I use stop losses only rarely. Options need room to move and in this market they definitely swing widely. A 25% stop loss is almost a guaranteed 25% loss with highly volatile tickers, especially SPX/SPY/QQQ/etc. Sorry, but making money trading options requires your daily attention if you're swing trading and constant attention if you're day trading.",461
"I don’t believe in stop losses as the price can move so fast you can stopped out on a winning trade. But I do cut my losses at some point. 
I think it’s more important to put your buy prices lower so you have more room for error. You got to have the attitude that you only buy at the right price and cash is king.",461
"IMO stop losses are better with directional bets on the underlying - ie “I’ll close when TSLA hits X price for X amount of time” as opposed to “I lost 25%, time to move on”. 

I like this better because if your timing is off or if there’s a temporary spike, you could easily hit stop loss without a large move on the underlying. If you sell at 2:55pm, 8:30AM hedging/volatility could stop you out 9:00AM you realize you were right but still lost money. 

Also - liquidity is a factor. 25% stop loss on ATM SPY options will be more successful than 25% stop loss on ITM/OTM options on ADBE, cause the bid-ask spread on ADBE can be a decent percentage of the contract value.",461
"Define what a trade w “no stop loss” looks like….do you hold til worthless? 

Every trade should have a “if this happens I cut losses” scenario. That’s a stop loss. Always have one.",461
Options are the stop loss.,461
Thing I had to realize about getting stopped out at low prices on winning trades is that means I should be buying at at my stop loss price rather than the price I was buying at.,461
"If you're long options the premium itself is your max loss. If it's still too much, select a different strike/expiry or trade the underlying.

If you're short options, you can cap losses with long options as legs/hedges. You can also close out your position prematurely if vol picks up too much.

Overall, stop losses can turn a larger loss into death by 1000 cuts. Furthermore, your gains take a hit from trades you get stopped out in.",461
SL doesnt work for options,461
"Not a financial advice but i do set up trailing stop loss if and when direction goes to my favor. I have to see the confirmation that thing goes to my favor to set trailing stop (typically 30%). 

But this is 0-3 dte, not weeklies, and therefore much easier to hit 2-3X if directionality is correct with volatility. 

I do this because no one wants to see your directionality is correct only to find out 30% stop loss from your cost basis. With training stop loss, i may not be able to make the top but still gives me decent profits. Profit is still profit as long as your risk to reward ratio is honored

This is when thing turns out in my favor but there are definitely cases where it doesnt go my favor. then i stop loss out when and if my price is rejected. I typically set up stop loss line in the chart and if it doesnt recover in 1 mins, then i sell. The average stop loss out is around 30% as well. Sometimes its 50% other times its 10%",461

"Check out spintwig's VIX backtests.

https://spintwig.com/tag/vix-vx/",462
"You stated that the VIX is between 14 and 25 for 80% of the time. However, on the other 20% of the time that it is above 25, there is quite a large range where VIX can be between 30-40 and in some cases, greater than 60. If you sell the 25 strike and buy the 50 strike for peace of mind, one of the problems you will encounter is the large delta disparity between the two. The potential problem this would create is if the VIX does rise to say 35, the short call would increase way more than your longs would increase. This means that if you have to close it out, you would have to buy back for much more because the short 25 call would be deep ITM, while  your long 50 call would still be OTM if the VIX is at 35.  All of a sudden, it would cost you 3.00 to 4.00 to close out something you sold for 0.40 wiping out several months worth of gains. This can happen all across the different strikes so even if you stagger into different months, you would still suffer a large drawdown. In fact, the the options with more DTEs (further out) would be affected more since they are more sensitive to Vega. If you are selling credit spreads, you are short Vega. A rapid rise in the VIX and those positions would get destroyed because volatility would increase.  Another thing to consider is the theta. The position is originally theta positive if the VIX stays below a certain level.  If the VIX
does rise to 35, the theta could shift to negative because that’s the nature of spreads. As the underlying goes through your short strike and closer to your longs, the theta could swing from positive to negative.  You now have a situation in your hands.  Do you close out now that the VIX is at 35 and take a loss or do you wait and hope for a retracement.  If you wait, the VIX can continue to rise which would compound your loss and put you deeper in the red.  In addition, you now have theta working against you (40 contacts would have a large negative theta) and you will lose money in each passing day.  Your $100k account could easily
be down $15-25k even on a non-black swan event.  If a black swan event were to occur like Covid, the VIX could very well go through your longs and you could be 50-60% in the red and your delta could be at -700 (negative) or higher.  This means a 1 point rise in VIX underlying (from 50 to 51 for example) and your position would be down $700. A 10 point rise (from 50 to 60) and you’re down another $7k.  These are just some examples that could happen.  Anyone else feel free to add or comment if I missed something.",462

When a major event happens, like covid and or Lehman's brothers collapse, a war in Ukraine, Taiwan, or the middle east etc etc. Vix can and will shoot to 60-80 within a day, and there might not be time to get out. Netting a loss that will ruin you.

If you do decide to do that against all advice. Please please please use a stop loss order at all times.",462
"Rolling on the vix usually does not work as expected. Your strategy should work without it. It also doesn't work as a contingency measure, simply because the more extreme the move, the more likely the market expects revert to the mean. 

Just for example. Imagine you had a short put and it goes itm. You will not be able to roll it out for a credit like on a normal stock. Usually when your put gets itm, market expectation is vix will recover, hence you will not get to roll down and out for a credit or even neutral. Same would be true for short calls. At the time you trying to roll, if call is itm or close you will not find an adequate future call with higher strike for a credit because market expectation will be for vix to normalize.

Otherwise I like an experimental approach and trying all kinds of things with vix. Just make sure to start small and try your strat before putting your whole port on the line. Good luck, and report back!",462
"Most people are advising against this trade for the widowmaker risk, and I agree with that. But the biggest reason not to sell these strangles is that your competition and the market makers are among the smartest traders alive. If you notice, the premiums are always terrible, risk is priced in when spikes or mean reversion is likely imminent. It is very, very hard to make money unless you are very lucky. My experience is that 15-20% of return on capital can be possible but once every few trades it swings against you and you go negative. And if you hold to expiration, prepare for wild swings. I think directly trading the micro futures is the better strategy—you either go short or long or use calendars. Still risky, but at least you can be profitable if you are directionally correct.",462
"UVXY is not vix. You need completely different data for it. It’s vix FUTURES, correlation is probably going to be ALOT lower than what you want for hedging. 

I think you need to look at tail risk more but you have the basis of a decent strategy. Many hedge funds run something similar, but you need to figure out the ratio for your hedge position",462
"Not worth the trouble and stress, which you may not survive emotionally, panic and mishandle your strategy when losing most of your money on occasion. It just looks nice on paper.
While you could simply put $100K into SVIX and do much better, though also with similar risk/stress. SVIX is also one of the easiest stocks/ETFs to trade,except for catastrophic events.",462
"I do a lot of option trades on volatility but I often prefer using the volatility ETPs rather than VIX.

Please don't sell naked calls on VIX. You are just asking for your account to get blown up. Other than there is nothing wrong with the strategy, it doesn't have a great risk return profile but I guess until you can develop better strategies it's okay...",462
A stop loss order is unlikely to save you in any sort of destabilizing situation. Hard hedges like wings are much more reliable.,462
"fyi that's nat gas that is called the widowmaker, not the vix.",462
"Indeed, so you have the choice:
- not taking a vix position
- heding a vix position fully

And in either case the risk is 0 and thus the reward is 0.",462
"I strongly suggest a tax pro as the RSUs may have some nuance to the cost basis.

As a general rule net capital gains for the year will be what is taxed.  If you had traded stocks and made $100K and then lost $120K in options, the net p&l would be -$20K.  Without a profit no tax would be paid, but only $3K of the loss could be applied to earned income if you didn’t have any other cap gains.  

Again, talk to a tax pro to be sure the RSUs don’t have something unique about them that may change this norm.",463
"Check with your tax dude......My understanding is that RSUs are taxed as compensation (ie, income), so can't offset with trading losses.",463
Correct so if those numbers are legit you you don’t owe anything cause technically your down 20k,463
"Depends.

RSU is considered income when vested.  If you get the RSU earlier in the year and the shares increase in value until you sell.  The cost basis when they vested x # of share = your income bonus.  Gain/loss after that time is capital gain/loss.

You'll owe the IRA based on the income portion of the RSU, however, they should already withhold the tax when the RSU vested.  You shouldn't have to pay anything extra to the IRA",463
"Back in the day before I traded for a living, my RSUs were granted based on a specific price at the time of the grant. 

For example, if the stock price used for the grant was $100 a share and my grant was for $10k, then at vesting I would receive 100 shares regardless of current price. But my cost basis was $10k. Also, they’re considered compensation and taxed at the time of vesting as ordinary income, usually by withholding shares. 

Then I wouldn’t realize capital gains or losses until I sold the shares but the cost basis was still $10k and my gains or losses would be calculated against that to either add or offset to other gains or losses for the year. 

Always best to consult a CPA if you’re unsure of how things affect your tax situation.",463
"You need a tax specialist.  Even which options you were trading impact how this will be calculated, for instance SPX index options are Section 1256 so they are taxed at 60% long-term/40% short-term, vs. equity options being short-term unless you did LEAPS.  RSUs depend what you’re reporting, when they’re awarded it’s income with tax withheld but if you then held the shares and are selling for a profit or loss that’s capital gains.",463
"You recognize capital gains when you sell. Unless you’ve elected mark-to-market accounting, a risky once-in-a-lifetime decision so normally only done for entities rather than natural persons.

Did you SELL RSUs? You mean restricted stock units issued by your employer? But you can’t sell them until they vest, unless there’s some buyback provision. Your paper “gains” aren’t taxed. Your company should have had educational sessions.",463
"You need tax advice but I can’t see you owing any taxes.  Assuming that the total RSUs are taxable, it’s still less than the losses on the options.",463
"Well, I think it's safe to say your investments this year didn't quite Robin-'hood' you any cash...but hey, at least you've got some material for a killer comedy set at IRS headquarters!

"Companies issue options, RSUs or both. 

Options are options, just not listed ones.

RSUs are actual stock, but you aren’t able to sell until they vest.

Important to understand what you have.

You can create a taxable event by exercising options. You should always immediately sell enough stock then to cover taxes. You could wind up paying the IRS for years if the stock subsequently dropped. As happened to a friend who was a receiving clerk at Qualcomm.

"You already know it splits frequently, compared to other ETPs.

https://stockscan.io/stocks/UVXY/stock-split

So the longer your hold a contract, the higher the risk of an unfavorable split, and basically all reverse splits are unfavorable for contract holders, since they necessarily make the contract non-standard. Non-standard contracts have a less liquid market than standard contracts.

In general, I stay way from options, even short holding time options, on ETPs that tend to have a lot of reverse splits. I also stay away from holding options for more than 60 days. A 2 year put on a reverse-split happy ETP is suicidal.

But you also have to look at tail risk. Even after adjusting for reverse splits, the variability of price covers a wide range, with a lot more price increase potential than decrease, relative to the current spot price. Since long puts have capped upside (shares can't go lower than $0), long puts are on the wrong side of the distribution of tail risk for those 20% of break-out prices. Of course, you can't lose more than the price you paid for the put, so your max loss is capped.",464

"Long vol will work out eventually. The question is can you afford eventually?

"UVXY is specifical tax forms like K-9 issuance which complicated the tax return and after dealing with this last year, i dont find it worth the time

But if you dont have to (i.e non resident alien who's not filing tax to US), my take home lesson was

Buy 25% of 1 lot of 100 shares. Sell naked call (75% naked call). Collect premium

If UVXY goes up, start cover with collar strategy with the same ratios (buy 100 shares/sell another 5-10% movement call options to collect premium, which will still result in 75% naked call sold/buy put options as UVXY eventually goes down)

If UVXY doesn't go up, (which is most of the case) then enjoy premium and ready for rainy days (i.e when UVXY spiked, you wanna buy put option to protect after you cover)

Rinse and repeat


It's hybrid strategy of collar and butterfly

Its one of the ideas and i prefer 1;3 ratios between shares and sold naked calls (i.e 100 shares and sell 3 OTM strike around 20-30 delta)

The big point you wanna make sure is contango. I forgot the schedule but UVXY gets reverse stocks in every 3-4 months so make sure to sell before this schedule to avoid liquidity issue (one that i learned from my mistake)",466

"I would definitely take some profits to lock in a sure gain but at the same time leaving a portion since you don’t know how much the market will give you while allowing your profits to run. One way is to scale out if you have multiple contracts. For example, sell 2/3, since you probably more than doubled or even possibly tripled your original cost.  This will guarantee a locked in profit no matter what. Then with the 1/3, maybe consider selling a Dec 45 call for 0.12. This will turn the position into a directional calendar spread with a bullish bias. The credit you receive will add to your profits and potentially eliminate your risk on the final 1/3 but at the same time, you can still profit if Ebay continues to rally. If it ends up around 45 by Dec expiration, your Jan will be worth another 0.70-0.90 cents and the Dec would ideally expire worthless.",467

"Some know edges that are common knowledge-ish:

* Implied volatility < actual volatility: you can make money selling options because there are parties that are willing to ""overpay"" for insurance. In this case, the trick is to make sure that you can somehow make sure that if trades go against you you will not get caught and blow your account. Most retail traders do this, most do it wrong. This is what I do.
* Earnings: volatility have very clear patterns around big events. There is usually volatility increases previous to the event with volatility crush after. Since this move it's somewhat predictable you can take advantage of it. Usually these strategies have big drawdowns
* Mis-pricing of rare events. Most people that are negative theta that are profitable (that I know of) take a lot of long shots hoping that one of them gives them outsized returns. The edge is that there tends to be discrepancies of opinions on how to price options around rare events. The Black -Scholes model assumes log-normality which is not really correct.

There could be many others, but as a rule of thumb, there is no meat to be found. Most strategies are adversarial; if I told you what I did it wouldn't work anymore.",468
"Options are one of the more interesting instruments to trade imo but you should definitely paper trade it for a while to prove profitability. It’s difficult enough to deal with slippage etc that you don’t need a crappy, unproven strategy on top of it. My recommendation is to look for strategies that guarantee a small return but have the potential for additional upside in a semi delta neutral way. 

Modeling it out is pretty important. Depending on your coding skills to do it yourself, I suggest you check out something like [marketchameleon](https://marketchameleon.com) or [quantcha](https://quantcha.com) for options analytics / filters /IV OI rankings and [MarkerPilot.ai](https://marketpilot.ai) for Delta/directional/time modeling.",468
"> We get into the position and leave when the edge is gone thus making a profit. 

That's a bit oversimplified. I'd break it down as:

* First you have to find an *exploitable* edge. They aren't all exploitable with the tools available to you as a retail options trader.

* Even if it is theoretically exploitable, you may make errors in the execution of your trade that wastes the edge.

* Even if you execute the entry to the trade correctly, you may make errors in the exit, by holding too long or not long enough, or picking an incorrect exit price target, or otherwise mistiming the change in expected value.

* Even if you get all of the above right, you may be under-capitalized for the risk and end up in a risk of ruin outcome.

Since edges are small, small errors in execution can easily wipe out all of the edge, and then some.

> So where is the meat? Where is the speculation and market anticipation?

The ""meat"" as you say is to factor speculation and market anticipation out of your trades as much as possible. For edge to be consistent, it has to neutralize or ""hedge out"" the inherent randomness of market price movement. Start from the assumption that anticipating the market is a fool's game. You want to make money *regardless* of which direction the market goes. You want to trade the market's *volatility*, not the market itself (although long term exposure to US beta isn't such a bad idea either).

However, not every option's trader is trading for edge. Arguably the biggest chunk of option exchange dollar volume is attributable to insurance activities rather than trading edge. Like if an institution has a large long exposure to SPY, they may want to hedge that with long SPY puts. They aren't trading edge in that case, the put trades would be accounted for as a cost of investment on their books. They may not care about profiting on the puts in isolation, it's more about managing risk/reward of the portfolio as a whole.",468
"You can look at options just being leverage. In other words if you identify a move on a widely held stock, buy an option instead to leverage your position.

When I was first taught options, I would buy a 70 delta with 5 months of time.",468
"Too much theory.

Just open up the option chain of a ticker (I recommend SPY) and preferably the one that updates in real time. thinkorswim is a pretty good one.

Observe how option prices change as the stock price change (delta and gamma).

Observe how the options that expire that day will diminish in value very fast it gets closer to 4pm (theta)

Observe how market volatility can also drive option price up (vega)

Do that for several days. For individual company, e.g AAPL or MSFT, pay attention to company earnings date, and notice the volatility in the prices the day before. That's the speculation and market anticipation you are looking for.",468
There is a large statistical edge in selling naked options or strangles when implied volatility rank is extremely high. I do this routinely with futures options.,468
"This book is correct. The market is efficient, meaning there's no easy arbitrage opportunities. You have to find alpha, also known as edge. It won't be easy to find because nobody that actually has one will share, and the max profit of any market inefficiency is limited.",468

Really, the differences aren't huge considering you won't be able to predict the exact path nvda takes.

Long options can not usually be rolled for a net credit, but require a debit that increases the risk.  Your $1500 loss can grow to $2000 or more by trying to adjust a trade like this.

Frankly, you made an ER ""bet"" or gamble that did not go the way you expect.  The IV Crush did not help of course, but you can either take the loss now before it gets worse, or if your analysis is the stock may rise back up faster than the theta decay will keep dropping the value then hold to see if this happens, but the loss may well be higher.",470
"There is **no** ""turning around"" for position here.

Rolling *isn't* any magic wand. You are basically closing your current position for a loss and opening a new one on the same underlying.

Ask yourself if you would buy that $500 strike call separately now (ignore the past — it's sunk cost now). If the answer is YES, then go ahead. Otherwise, NO. 

Your money can be better served in some other position too. At the end of the day, it's MONEY. It doesn't matter if you make or lose it on the same underlying or a different one.",470
"Just close it out. You were bullish prior to earnings report. Report came out and the stock went down. That means your original thesis didn’t work. Now if you are still bullish, then you should go further out than Dec 15th. If you roll down to 500 and your new cost is 26.50 after rolling, that means your breakeven is 526.50.   Each day that passes, you will lose $40-50 on theta. Yes it can still make money on it but NVDA has to rally in th next 3 weeks if you stay with the Dec 15 expiration.",470
"Don’t roll, sell a call weekly against it (4 opportunities to get back some lost premium) ie try and net $250 to $750 per week to get to break even or small profit. Currently with only 1 day to go the 11/24 495 C nets $250 (that you may want to pass on if you think it’s too close) 12/1 505 C nets $400+ 12/8 510 C nets $750 and finally 12/15 517.50 C nets 825+ OBVS these prices will change but it’s a way to mitigate your losses. You want to consider debit spreads in the future to limit losses. On NVDA specifically I bought 50 12/15 420-430 debit spreads for around $6.85 a few weeks ago I’m pretty confident they will expire worth $10 each. I never (rarely buy out of the $) that’s my 2 cents",470

"By selling a weekly against it, for instance the Dec 1 500 call for 5.05, it will turn the position into a neutral strategy. If NVDA does rallies to 520 or higher by next week, two things will change. First is the delta will change from positive to negative because of the short call that’s closer to ATM. Second thing is the position will be deeper in the red. The short 500 call will gain more than the long 520 call resulting in a larger loss because the delta on the 500 will be higher than the 520 delta hence the negative delta change.",470

"I use it in every investment I make. I developed a version of the Kelly criterion in high school.  I have a math degree.

Look at a number of trades and have an opinion on the success of each one as a probability.  Then invest in each one in exactly the same way they use in horse betting.

https://www.championbets.com.au/betting-academy-article/what-is-the-kelly-criterion

Its related to the [min-max theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Min-max_theorem). In horse betting you want to minimise the maximum amount you can lose.

"It’s not very clear at all what you’re asking but happy to take a stab at it. You’re basically doing a roundabout calculation of expected value. EV is simply p(win) * return if you win + p(lose) * return if you lose. For example, if you have a 50/50 chance to win or lose and your return if you win is 1% and your return if you lose is -0.5%, then your EV is .5*.01 + .5*-.005 or .25%. That is edge in a strategy, and that is what the goal in any trading strategy is. 

In terms of the optimal allocation, look into the Kelly criterion. It’s an optimal way to allocate capital into a strategy.",471

"I didnt watch those videos. But assumming these mumbers are right, this won't be profitable. No. 

Risk = 0.8
Profit = 0.16
Loss = 0.40

Winrate to be profitable?? Realistically, 80% to make.... .16x4 or .64 and 1 loss of .40, for a net of .24 minus fees.

Assuming fees are .025 to open and close, it will be 0.25 x5 spreads, for 12.5, which I will round down to .12.

After fees, profit is .12. The expected gain per trade is.... 2%. 

And each time you are risking 4 times the amount you can make. This is not a no, the is a hell no dog.

You are much better off not trading any options here and just DCAing into shares. You will easily beat the 2% per entry and don't have to deal with theta decay, gamma exposure and all sorts of other rigging mechanisms that make options nearly unwinnable. 

Just my thoughts on this.",471
"Typically the EV of a spread is approximately equal to the premium. If you want to find the 50/50 spread — where the cost of the spread is equal to the max gain, it will straddle (pun intended) the money. So for example, at SPX 4540, the 4500/4580 spread will be 50/50 (as will the 10/70, 20/60, etc.). If you believe the price moving up or down is a coinflip, then you’ve just backed into the EV of the spread. A 4500/4580 should cost (or credit) you $4k at any expiration, exactly 50/50.

The volatility smile will change the value of the spread if the price is 4542, where a bear put will credit you more (Bull put, will cost you more). How much more will depend on the angle of the smile, so that’s where the expiration will factor in. 

I don’t think you’ll find 4500/4580 spreads at a 4540 price for something different than $4k, but if you do, let me know!",471
">Ill stick to put credit spreads so we want them to expire above the strike price of the top of the ladder:

>let p be the max profit of the spread, and s be the size of the spread, such that the ratio r gain is calculated by p/(s-p), eg is we have a $0.2 sell, and the size of the spread is $1.00, our risk is $0.80.

Let me simplify this for you, you are playing an over/under game with binary options.  The 20¢ credit basically reflects a 20% chance the strike sold will expire ITM.

Here is my question for you, why do you believe that the put will expire OTM?  Is it just because there is just a 80% chance, or are there other reasons?",471
[deleted],471
"Nice, thanks for the links! Spitting it even further makes sense too. I honestly hate risk mitigation because it feels like it slows it down so much but after blowing up a few small test accounts I understand the need",471
"Sure, basically if you flip a coin and it is %50 chance you gain %80, vs %50 chance you lose %50, when you be the farm (your whole account) on average you lose money, because you take huge chunks out of your principle account, but when you calculate what fraction of your account you should bet using the formula the video provides. you over time accumulate wealth. It is a paradox because if probablity gain times gain minus probablity times loss times loss is greater than 0, it is considered a good trade, however if you eat away to large a chunk of your principle it is not a good trade",471
"This is exactly what I was looking for, thank you",471
"> And each time you are risking 4 times the amount you can make. This is not a no, the is a hell no dog.

This is why the just one more paradox solves this issue. I can speak from experiance I did a trial run starting with $3k and putting trades that had a 90% chance to be successfull, %10 fail rate. Basically I turned that 3k into 13k in 2 months (some variance on how I stragtegized) but the idea was in place. I bet the farm every trade, and I told myself the point was to see how far I could get on 3k. Then, 1 bad trade took me down 8k, to 5k. I cut the strategy from there needing to think about how to mitigate risk, this fractional optimization approach seems to be the missing puzzle piece.

to find if a gamble is in your favor you multiply the probability of success times the potential gain minus the probability of loss times the potential loss, if that is greater than zero and you can do many trials you have bult a recipe for success.

I have real life experience doing this. The probability you get a parking ticket vs the price of the parking ticket when I went to college was cheaper than buying a parking pass. I didn't know what the probability of getting a parking ticket was but I knew the theory. I parked all over campus to ensure my car did not get recognized but overall I spent ~$300 in parking tickets that semester vs the $500 fee for a parking pass. I didn't do it the next semester but I am very familiar with the concept",471
"well given no other information on the stock if the strike price and the stock prices were matched there would be a 50% chance on expiration the stock would be above the strike price. Usually those are about a $0.35 premium that you sell.

If you go lower the probablity it stays above a specific price goes up, almost a unique bell curve at each timestamp. There are 3d models that show what that looks like. it is not nessisarrily an 80% chance,  in fact the black scholes that usually calculates those odds and what the market is doing differ quite often, probably because the models that run the market are much more complex than my simple-ish concept. 

Lets say the stock is at $100, at a $50 strike the odds it stays above are almost 100%. At $95 that depends on the volitilty of the stock which Black Scholes does take into account. Assume you can calculate the probablity of the distribution (this concept is baking in the random walk, efficient market theory into the idea), such that 1 standard deviation from the $100 is $5, meaning there is roughly a 70% chance it is between $95 and $105, this means that the probability it stays above $95 is 85%.

so if you have an P(S>N|T) Where S is the stock price at time T, N is $95, and say T is 1 day equal to 0.85, that means any gain over 0.15 is a good play.

This happens very little though",471
"> This is what every option trader is (or should be) doing.

A lot of concepts I am using I would imagine are not nessisarily on many option traders minds.

"I do something similar but usually with monthly options, occasionally weeklies. I posted in r/thetagang to give an update on my trades just a few days ago.

Your strategy looks like just blindly selling weeklies (no offence there) and I actually back-tested such strategies before [https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/17ktm4h/tsla\_short\_put\_backtesting\_results\_1425\_roi\_over/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thetagang/comments/17ktm4h/tsla_short_put_backtesting_results_1425_roi_over/)

Our strategies are similar in some aspects and I call such strategy ""blind selling"" because it doesn't look at any indicators. I plan to add some indicators in my backtest and I believe that will improve returns. Something like RSI or just simply moving average - only sell puts when oversold, etc.

Currently one thing I do a little different from you is more aggressive strike selection. A problem with this blind put selling strategy is that TSLA crashes inevitably (based on historical data), and when it does crazy moves, your strikes will be hit anyways.  Knowing that strikes will be hit hard, collecting more premium to help offset that impact makes more sense.

I also like to add short calls, but only if when I have actual shares to make a CC. I'm comfortable taking the downside risk in TSLA, not upside like selling naked calls.",475

TSLY is about 12 per share. Therefore you have 20K left. Place a limit order to buy 100 TSLA at 180. You can adjust the limit price anytime based on market condition. Your order is not married to a put.

I am having a hard time visualizing when I will get my short call exercised due to dividend.

"Here is a comment from a former market maker, explaining what the corresponding put has to do with it.

You are not going to get assigned on a short option that still has extrinsic value.  [Read this.](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/180n6iu/comment/ka7vm7v/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3),477
"Thanks for digging this out for me. So, it seems there're different scenarios possible for different actors:

1. For a ""normal"" ITM call holder who intends to acquire a stock via that call anyway, and who wants to capture divvy, it makes sense to sell the call before ex-div, for as long as there's any time premium in it at all, and then buy the stock in the open market, pocketing time premium. The culprit is that soon before ex-div, there's going to be very little time premium in the call, at least for the bid price. Of course, one can hope to sell at closer to mid-market, but buyers smartly won't accept prices anyhow higher than the bid price. Then, failing to sell to capture even pennies of the time value, it makes sense to exercise to at least capture dividend, if the expiration date is soon enough (e.g. a few weeks) anyway (and of course if conviction is that the price won't fall below strike by then).

2. Separate scenario is a pure arbitrage play, described by the link above, where someone holds a call, but buys a put cheaper than the dividend to be able to use it as the downside protection, while holding the stock in the meantime accounts for keeping exposure to the upside which the original call had.


One ""dumb noob question"" here is whether an extrinsic value can somehow increase after it dipped. It's clear that ""time value"" can't increase, it only deteriorates. But pricing options with dividends is a tricky business, Black-Scholes model doesn't account for them, so I wonder if the market model does includes some param of dividend process in the extrinsic value. Or it's all left to be accounted in the intrinsic value.",477
"Exercising purely to capture a dividend (or buying a stock at all purely to capture a dividend) is a wash, though, because all other things being equal, the stock opens lower by the value of the dividend the morning of the ex-dividend date.

My understanding is that, by the true definition of arbitrage, the described pro/MM play isn't arbitrage.  They're not entering this situation because something is differently priced in 2 different places.  And they still aren't going to exercise if the call can be sold for extrinsic value.  Rather, they already had a long call, then they find themselves in a situation where 1) it can't be sold for extrinsic value, and 2) the value of the dividend is greater than the value of the corresponding put.  Thus exercising and buying the put places them in the same synthetic position as before (long call = long shares + long put) only now they collect the dividend (or at least, the difference between the dividend and the cost of the put.)

Cost of carry is a factor too; it had been miniscule for years because of those historically low interest rates, but has become more relevant with the increases in interest rates.  For these reasons, looking at the value of the corresponding put is a shortcut to tell you whether it's *likely* you'll be assigned on your short call, but it's not a 100% guarantee.",477
"It is a good thesis. I have made a few trades doing this but you have to have a good forecast of what the implied move should be, and what the IV should be. 

For example, you should isolate the ex-earnings IV and the earnings move. Since you want to be right on both, I would find the stocks that have edge on each side. You can compare the IV to HV, percentiles, forecasts, and relationships to components of the ETF the stock is associated. ORATS has all this. The implied move should be compared to past actual moves, relative moves for this season, forecasts of moves that account for the above. Again ORATS has this.

ORATS has data and student discounts (and Reddit discounts in my profile). 

You can also backtest this thesis on [ORATS.com](https://ORATS.com) using these methods. You may want to test hedging deltas.",478
"You’re right in maximizing IV by going far OTM. And definitely don’t hold through earnings. That’s a completely separate type of trade. 

However, Theta decay will still usually still outshine the IV increase. An OTM strangle will preform better in that window before earnings than in a normal environment, but to profit you will most likely need to be correct about the IV increasing (that’s the easy part), and also get some price movement as well. 

You could also incorporate starting with stocks at low relative historical IV and hold up to earnings. Or Maybe a double far OTM calendar would be best suited for this type of trade",478
I read once that buying options 1 month before earnings is a way to cash in. I am normally a seller of options when IV rises and I try to figure out the implied moves. It has been successful for me. The way this market has been though you might have to buy more then a month out. But please post your report when you get it figured out. I hope this helps.,478
[deleted],478
"Well, good luck with that thesis, but if you want a more realistic and profitable strategy, just buy $ROPE and hang onto it until you graduate.",478
You can back test with thinkBack from ToS.,478
"Hey, I think you’d find more success if you research calendars. You can be near delta neutral with a long calendar, and you can do it with strangles if you want. The idea is to sell the strangle for the week of earnings and buy it for sometime after, making you short gamma and long Vega, collecting theta. Your main risk is a blowout move where the gamma performs more than theta received and if vol comes out too much. You should be able to research whether or not this type of strategy works at different month spreads (1 week vs 1 month etc), and whether being long or short the calendar is better. You could even look to see if there’s seasonality at play, where you might want to be short the calendar prior to earnings week then flip to long calendar during earnings week, etc",478
"OP, buying strangles (or straddles) leading to earnings and closing them just before the release is a viable strategy. Ive done it profitably. But there are a lot of nuances. I wont go into the details, but the key thing to understand is : there is a fight between theta and vega. Theta will lose you money everyday and rising vega will make you money. We want the vega gains to be greater than the theta losses. Normally this doesn't work out. But there are a few cases/stocks where the IV rise is sufficient to compensate for the theta. Then of course, there is gamma - if the stock moves quickly or a lot, then we make a profit.

Good luck.",478
"Wow, I've never seen someone make earning calls sound so exciting! This strategy sounds so cool, it could be the subject of [Positional Option Trading](https://www.amazon.com/Positional-Option-Trading-Wiley/dp/1119583519?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=thetatitans-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=70ad9782f307a00e6197f5bf84596fa4&camp=1789&creative=9325). Keep us updated on how it goes and remember, always stay delta neutral...or at least as neutral as possible 🤓.",478
The thesis is IV increases. Just because options are otm doesn't mean it's a gamble..,478

"The buy limit on an order and strike selection are two different things in options trading, though there is a cost connection through moneyness. Basically, the more the strike is in-the-money, the more expensive the corresponding contract will be, all else equal.

More about orders here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourorders

Strike selection is a complicated topic, so you'll have to do some self-study before any of that will make sense. But TL;DR, strike selection is a trade-off between cost of delta and probability of profit, you have to pay more in order to have a better chance at profit. It can also be thought of as a trade-off between leverage and probability of profit. More leverage means lower chance at profit.",481

"I think you're still not really processing how options work.  The goal in trading options is not to trade the underlying.  You are not buying, for example, a 58 strike call because you want to buy the stock at $58 per share.

A limit order to buy an option is an order to buy *the option itself* (not the underlying stock) when the *price of the option itself* (which is called the premium) reaches a certain price *for the option itself* (not the price of the underlying stock.)

When you trade shares of stock or futures, you can buy them at one price, hope the price goes up, and sell them for a profit.  Or, if you're bearish, you can sell them short, hope the price goes down, and buy to cover for a profit.

But with options, each option on the options chain--put or call, particular strike, particular expiration date--is its own, independent financial security that is traded in an open market, independent of the underlying.

For example, here's part of the options chain, showing all the December 15 options, on a stock currently trading around 66, ZM:

[https://imgur.com/a/K1Vt9KR](https://imgur.com/a/K1Vt9KR)

The 12/15 35 strike call is its own entity, trading at its own price.  The 12/15 40c is its own entity, trading at its own price.  The 12/15 45 strike is its own entity, trading at its own price.  And so on.  You can see the bid/ask on each option.

The 58c has a bid of 8.25 and an ask of 8.65.  One thing you could do, is take a bullish position on ZM buy buying one of these calls.  To do so, you would pay somewhere between $825 and $865, probably closer to $865 (because options are quoted in per-share values but each contract is for 100 shares.)  If ZM went up, the premium of the option would go up, and you could then sell it for a profit (i.e., more than the $865 you paid for it.)  Not use it to buy the shares.",481
Thank you for taking the time to respond,481
"Not enough information to answer. Once the stock hits 58, you have to tell me what expiration you want and at least one of the following additional details:

* How much you are willing to spend (in which case I will find the highest delta call with a bid that is lower than or equal to your budget, for the expiration specified).

* What probability of profit you want, regardless of cost (in which case I will find the corresponding strike call, regardless of cost).

* How much leverage you want, regardless of probability of profit (in which case I will find you the highest delta call that matches your leverage target, for the expiration specified).

If you don't know any of those, just buy the next monthly $58 call at the market price. That's similar to buying the front-month future at the spot price.",481
"That is insane, ZM is the exact symbol I’m talking about. I want to buy it at 58, then take it to 70, or even 80. I’ll just stick to futures, and go heavy on shares. Options is way too complicated",481
And on thinkorswim it easily lets me set a simply buy order for shares/dollar amount to invest at the specific price. I’ll just have to stick with that,481
"To do what you explained a few posts up with options, you could do the following:

Sell 1 ZM PUT option contract with a strike price of 60, and expiration Feb 16 ‘24.

1 contract is for 100 shares.

You’ll collect 2 / share up front in premium.

Two possible outcomes:

A. ZM is above 60 by Feb 16. The contract expires worthless you keep the 2 in premium.

At this point you can turn around and sell another call that perhaps  expires in May for perhaps another 2 in premium.

B. ZM is below 60 by Feb 16. You’re assigned the shares at 60 each, effectively 58 because of the premium you collected up front. Now you can hold the shares to 70 or 80.",481

1) delta .75 is less than 1 standard deviation, ive been watching the main indexes and lately they all make moves greater than 1SD  very frequently, so 1/2 of those moves would be against you.

2) QQQ doesn't even have the advantage of being an european style option, and you're selling puts ITM so you're gonna get assigned, more than you'd like. 

3) on such a short time interval, to me it feels like you can't even count on statistics, its just pure chaos, and have no time to wait out a bad move.  


someone educate me where i'm wrong here. is the IV vs HV really that much of a premium in 0DTE options to where this is worth it?",483

"Sorry about my bad terminology. I meant cash secured puts

I sell a cash secured put every day at 0.75 (about) delta before 10 am with 0 DTE

1) For example, today I sold my put with strike at 387 when QQQ was trading at 388.5; I got a credit of $45 and it looks like the put will expire worthless. I am not planning to roll it but will do the same tomorrow. When I sold it I just stared at my screen for like 15 minutes and hit the sell button.... there must be a better way do determine when to sell. Open to suggestions.

2) Let say I sold today the 387 strike and the stock dropped from  388.5 to 380. Then at the end of the day (before market close) I would roll the put (buy todays put and sell tomorrows put) to 382 ($2 dollars above 380 which is about 0.25 delta) expiring tomorrow. 

3) I hope I explained myself better now.

"Yeah, I am also doing this with Intel, selling weekly puts except when it is a dividend week, then I buy the stock and sell a call. IS that what you mean?

I have been killing it with Intel for like 3 months",483
"Well, at 10 the volatility has already decreased like 5%, I would say to buy at 9 am... that is when the volatility is crazy. I got assigned two times because I was playing chess and forgot to close my possitions. No big deal, I got a margin call (of $39,000) and the following day I sold the shares and sold a put... it cost about $15 per day to have a margin debit of that amount in Robinhood (at 8%). What is good about what I am doing is that the cash I have it invested in ultra short term treasuries which yield 5%. There was a post that I read that it was better to have the shares and sell the calls since the call price has the free interest rate included in the price (and it makes total sense) so I might flip my strategy, also, if you sell calls you might get the dividend. I just am sooo used to puts that it is hard to change the chip in my brain.",483
"Good questions,

1. YES!!! you are absolutely right about this, Last month I had to roll at a lost for about 2 weeks, It just kept falling and I you kept loosing $50 to $100 every roll (every day) until one day I think !!! was at 365 and my strike was 367 so suddenly it went from 365 to 369 in a day, that one expired worthless, and then the next day I sold at 367 and again... expired worthless, and then at 368 and... worthless.. the way I see it, it is like owning the stock because the strategy is just so dependant to the delta. you own the stock (ETF) and have a tiny bit of a cushion if it drops. I don't think it it is the best strategy but it has worked for me so far (making about $30.00 per day considering the losses at the beginning). and I am happy to own 100 shares of QQQ. Most people with 401 K own them without knowing (VUG from Vanguard is the QQQ equivalent and a lot of people consistently buy them in their retirement plan). 
2. Don't worry, this one's will very rarely be assigned. and if is you can sell the stock and resell the same put.
3. Yeah, it is like owning the stock, in one (good) hand you have a Crazzzy delta and IV (all your premium is attributed to tetha and vega) but in the other delta and gamma are very elevated.

I am not trying to convince anyone about this strategy, I really just wanted a better way to know when to enter the trade because right now I just stare at the screen like an idiot.",483
They only manipulate 15 minutes after the market closes (QQQ options can still be traded 15 minutes after market close and QQQ trades 24 hr a day). the rest of the day they really cannot do much. They would need a lot of money to fight the humongous trade volume. That is why I always sell before market close if it is about to expire worthless. Those $3 save me from the sudden drop below my strike,483
"Yes, thank you, that's very clear now. 

I think ""stare at your screen (1-minute candle chart)"" is pretty much what every daytrader does. If you have or can get Level 2 real-time quotes on QQQ and look at the depth of the book, you might have a little more data for price action, but at the end of the day, you're looking for a move, right?

I think the roll is fine *as long as you aren't expecting a multi-day down trend*. It might be better to just close the losing trade and try again the next day. That way you get to see what the price action is before having to make a decision. If QQQ goes on a multi-day downtrend, the roll will make things worse.",483

"I want to place 1dte trades with starting capital of $1,200. Any recommended stocks?",484
"Hi everyone (:

I have a question on understanding the return, risk and exposure profile of an options + share strategy.
The strategy (which has been mentioned within other subreddits) is an accumulating variation on the ""Wheel"" where the premium from selling covered calls and cash secured puts are reinvested into more shares of the underlying. 

One proponent of the strategy calls it the ""STAG Wheel"" (admittedly with a lot of hyperbole) has increased the number of shares held of the underlying (PLTR) by 300% through the last 2 - 3 years.

I have the intuition that some complex, multi-legged options strategies can be replicated by simpler strategies. 

One view I have in this case is that the purchase of shares from CC & CSPs add a fraction of a constant +1 delta to the stock+option position. At the point of purchase this can also be replicated by skewing the put and call strikes up. But I don't think this is the correct way to understand this strategy, especially when more than 1 round of CCs and CSPs are carried out.

Another attempt at figuring this out has me consider the written options as being 0 premium sales which do not affect the cost basis of the original shares but contribute to an cost-free increase in leverage (i.e. 3 shares from the premiums = +3% leverage) on the underlying, but this view seems to run into trouble when considering assignments. In this case, one can deleverage also by exchanging the leverage for the current spot price of the underlying.

Still, this suggests that this option + stock strategy hopes to profit by increasing leverage for some future sale above cost basis.

Are there any resources or opinions I can consult to understand the risk and return profile of this strategy? Thank you very much.",484
"You're welcome.

"Rolling is best when the option is ATM as once it gets too far ITM rolling for a net credit is not usually possible.  If you want to roll in the future then do so ATM and before it gets too far ITM . . .

Unless the stock drops back to where you can roll for a net credit then it may make more sense to let the shares get called away and use the capital for a new trade.  

I agree with u/wittgensteins-boat that  you  don’t  want  to  roll  out  too  far,  and  60  dte  max.",484
"I guess you mean calls.  Covered calls.  

Allow the shares to be called away for a gain at expiration.  

That was your original commitment upon entering the trade.  

In general do not issue covered calls for longer than 60 days, and if you must roll out in time, and chase the price, do not roll for a debit to a new strike.  Do so for net zero, or a credit. No more than 60 days out.",484

1. Note: Every penny you earn corresponds to an equivalent risk.
2. Choose the most liquid underlying, as you may trade everyday.
3. 1dte strategy may not be profitable, ref: [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4404704](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4404704)",484
"I'm a long time wheel trader.  How and what each trader does with their returns are up to the individual.  The most critical aspect of the wheel is to trade stocks you don't mind owning and holding, so if the trader wants to own more and uses their profits to buy more than this is up to them.

Buying shares is less efficient than selling puts, so IMO the additional BP provided by the return can be more effectively and efficiently used to sell puts on other stocks to diversify.  

No matter how strong the sentiment is on any one stock, it can still tank.  Spreading risk over multiple stocks just makes good sense.  Buying shares of the stock in small increments is adding risk to the account if that stock does drop, and unlike selling puts the shares cannot be rolled or adjusted.

Again, what anyone does with their profits from trading is up to them.  As options gives a number of advantages with leverage and efficiency it seems counter-intuitive to use capital that could be used to make more of these efficient options trades and tie it up in the less efficient buying of a small number of shares.  

To your point, that capital will sit in those shares instead of being used to trade more options and in the expectation they may be sold for a profit in the future.  Any analysis of this needs to take into account the 'lost profits' of options trades not made.

I'll completely agree that complex multi leg strategies are not always better and IMO there is no strategy that is more simple and efficient than simply selling a put on a stock you would not mind owning . . .",484

"The interest rate changed on November 15th. So for half the month you were earning the old rate, and half the month the new rate.",495
"APY includes compounding. APR does not include compounding. You need to be using the effective APR in your calculations otherwise you’ll appear to be short.

APY accounts for compounding interest, and computing your interest on a monthly basis cannot account for the interest your interest earns for the remainder of the year when you haven’t earned that interest yet. You’ll likely find that the remaining $44 in interest you will earn in the next 11 months would pay around $0.08 per month on average if you could allocate it evenly across a 12 month period, thus explaining the gap.",495
Hopefully not down,496
"First hit is always free. 

And yeah, good for you for having the insight for liquidating and putting your money into an ETF. That's what I would suggest. 

If you don't want to sell now, at least put a stop loss on that Tesla position.",496
"It all depends on how much you believe in the company. Read the news, look into what Musk is doing and what he plans to do, and consider the routes of tangental fields (AI, Automobiles, Tech, Robotics, etc.) 

With that only you can make the most informed decision with what you want to do with your money. 

Many with 1200+ percent return will maybe diversify a bit and invest with the gains. 

I invest for the long term. I don't see Tesla going out of business any time soon and I can see Musk, Tesla, SpaceX etc. making more money within the next 5-10 years at least. Which means you will likely make money if you keep those investments. 

Take everything anyone says with a grain of salt and good luck.",496
"TSLA is a purely growth stock, so if the market sours you're out a lot. Sell that stock and invest in a reliable dividend ETF like SCHD or JEPI.",496

Buy some Opendoor shares,496

"Pey etf , it good one",496
I believed in TSLA back in 2019 but with elon being an even more questionable person now compared to then idk how I feel about it. I know a lot of people aimlessly follow him so maybe I can make some money off a bad person.,496
That sounds like a pretty safe bet. Im a long term person so ill more than likely go that route,496
"No that's not the best unless you're a gambler. The best is to continue to invest. Make more secure investments than 80% in one company. Considering its been 4 years since they invested, they aren't looking for a quick buck.

Diversify your portfolio. ETFs like SPY will be a great option for continued growth. Otherwise invest in some companies that you are interested in.",496

Because a stock having a bull run doesn’t automatically make it a good investment 😂,498
"Reducing debt doesn’t mean anything. Don’t chase a falling knife. Anytime you see a stock go -97%, know that there’s a reason.",498
No. Nobody else thinks this. But you should definitely go sell some puts so we can laugh.,498
You should jump on it and let us know how it goes 6 months from now. They’ll probably be delisted and bankrupt lmao,498
"1. Net Debt. The only reason of the Debt’s decline is shares issuances (e.g., 350 m$ in 2022).
2. Stock price. Now the company can be considered neither a growth nor value story…",498
"contributing periodically (i.e monthly) in market indexes such as $VOO and leaving it alone for years without looking at it will yield you better results than actively trying to time and pick individual stocks 9 times out of 10. it's a boring slow process, if you're having fun with it, then you are doing something else than investing imo",499
"There's only two real rules when it comes to investing. 

1) Never invest more than what you are comfortable with losing. 
2) Do your own due diligence; dont blindly invest in whatever Jim Cramer, MarketWatch, ect are pushing at the time. Don't even let redditors like me influence what companies you invest in. 

Other than that, go nuts. Some (relatively) safe long term investing strats includes the SNP500 or the SPHD index which tracks the general progression of the stock market. If you wanna try a 90s buffet style of investing, you could look into the dividend kings stocks (this is how I got into investing) which have been producing consistent dividends for 50+ years and are unlikely to stop producing said dividends anytime soon. 

Options are tools that can be incredibly useful at mitigating loss, but equally dangerous if improperly utilized in the pursuit of greed. There's a YouTuber I really like called 'in the money' who doesn't push any stocks but instead only teaches how they work. Options were originally designed to be used as safety nets and hedges instead of the quick buck people are using them for now.

As always, nothing in this post should be considered as financial advice. 

Good luck 👍",499
Study,499
Stocks are going to crash so I would buy physical silver/gold.,499
"If I were you I’d put all of my money on black and hit the hot dog stand by the ATM. This is gonna be a long, bumpy ride kid.",499
">However I don’t know a lot of things yet like what’s the difference between buying shares or dollars?

Buying shares means you can only buy full shares of stock, while buying in dollars allows for far greater flexibility in the amount you invest.

Suppose you want to buy a share of Nike (NKE), which goes for $107 and change, but you only have $100 available to invest. 

Obviously, you don’t have enough to afford a full share of Nike, so you would buy using the dollars setting, of which $100 in Nike would get you ~0.9289 shares of Nike at the current premarket price. 

Then, the next time you go to invest more $, you can purchase the rest of that share of Nike. 

>I also don’t know what companies to invest on and I don’t know how much to invest.

To answer your second question, blue chip companies are going to be your safest bets. 

Companies like ExxonMobil, Johnson and Johnson, Google (Alphabet), Amazon, the list goes on. 

It’s also worth mentioning that you are practically guaranteed to hear people recommend what are called index funds, which are investments sold by companies with the intent to pool cash from multiple investors and invest it amongst the companies in a stock market index like the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 or Dow Jones Industrial Average.

There are dozens of index funds out there, but some of the well known ones are VOO, SPY, VTI, QQQ and DIA.

Invest as much or as little as you like, that’s the beauty of the dollar function.",499
"Depending on your financial situation, if you don’t have any bills or anything to pay for, I would invest in riskier stocks, if you do, invest in ETFS and some of the bigger companies",499
"Open a Roth account with Fidelity and put whatever you can afford into the Sp500 (VOO) every paycheck till you hit the 6,500$ then the rest  into a SP 500 Taxable account. If your employer or future employer offers a 401 k take advantage of that also and best of luck.",499
Learn as much as you can and get a good job to fund your inevitable gambling addiction.,499
"99% of new traders fail in the first 3 years. The solution: Do not play with your money, trade the money of prop firms, if you fail you are never gonna lose your own money, if you win, 90% of the win is for you!  Follow my lead for more info, free ...",499
Buy dogecoin.,499
Buy CLOV,499
I know little you can have in there,500
"You shouldn’t hold more than the insurable limit anywhere. So in effect, that amount is the maximum.

Look at FTX and BlockFi. Those customers may or may not get anything back. On RH, if something similar happens, you’re protected up to the limits by the federal government.",500
No there isn’t a limit and no they don’t insure up to 10m.,500

^^^^2023-11-09",517
"Don't buy what you don't agree with, but also don't operate off emotions.",518
"You shouldn’t ever enter into a position you don’t have your heart behind. If you feel negative sentiment about the company, then there’s no way you can have an objective view on the company and thus manage your position fairly. 

Why do you hate energy??",518
I realize the sooner I get rich enough I can drop out of the system completely. Shoulda put everything on Halliburton 3 years ago :-/,518
Put two grand in.,518
"Lol

Looser, get your emotions out of the trade!",518
Buying Cramer stocks?,518
Blood money :),518
You agree with the gain but not the company’s stock.,518
homie doesnt have a car or use light,518
"Dumbest comment I’ve ever seen. The stock market is a tool to accumulate and preserve wealth. Not a popularity contest. Every single one of these publicly listed companies could care less about you. They’d leave you to die in the street if it meant they increased their profit margin by 2%. 

Invest in what you think will make you money. The first rule anyone is taught when investing or trading is to not enter positions with emotion. This comment is as far backwards from that sentiment as possible.",518
"This is a rule you can follow in every aspect of your life: job, relations, hobbys..  
Invest your time, money and energy in what you are happy to give 100%. 

Heart will be the final judge when you'll need to manage a difficult situation",518
Market is all emotion but good luck being a bot.,518
Put in money. Pull the lever.,519
"Here’s what not to do take the money you where going to allocate to stocks and start trading options. 

I would just invest in index funds maybe look at some dividend growth stocks just to get your foot in the market. 

Also when I say look at you have to figure out fair market prices for those stocks and pay close to the price for them. You can do research to find those fair market values.",519
Step one: DO NOT GET INFORMATION FROM REDDIT.,519
"First step, look at different trading methods. Do you want to swing trade? Day trade? Or invest? Your answer to that will determine everything else. Watch some videos on YouTube, read some books and articles and such, and most importantly before you do anything KNOW ABOUT THE COMPANY.

If I could go back I would have started with paper trading, so that I could get the feel for things. I also wouldn’t have tried to swing trade with options as much, since that’s a great way to blow money if you’re wrong. If you’re young I’d recommend putting 80% of whatever you have into just an index and letting it sit, you’ll thank yourself in the long run.",519
"They have a premade list of the top (most popular) stocks.  This might be a good place to start.  When you buy a stock, you can use the Limit feature and say what price you want to pay.  Market price is whatever it’s going for at the time.",519
"Throw some money into dividend stocks and learn from there while earning dividends. From there, start researching growth stocks NVDA, MSFT, or APPL. These stocks are always going to go up so your value will grow over time. Then take a flyer on cheaper, more risky stock.",519
"https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/

I just came across this website a few days ago, and I've been investing for over a decade. I haven't had a chance to use it yet, but I have the feeling that it'll help me level up.",519
Have you googled your questions?,519
"Buy now. 

Invest with money you don't need for a long time.

Let it sit, and if anything, buy more.

Buy in businesses you believe in; it makes holding and buying more in the future much easier.",519
"All the info you need is online for FREE. Start studying trading videos & read books. Get into some FREE trading communities & learn. Don't pay anyone a dime & see if it's something you want to do in life. If it is & you have put in the time to learn - Buckle up & Start Trading - As with anything in Life, it takes years to be successful so be patient  ✌️",519
"Buy high, sell low. If all fails, clear cache, uninstall and reinstall app to reset.",519
Don’t,519
If you can't figure out the world's easiest brokerage user interface you should probably not trade,519
Or go all in on black! 🤓🤣🤣,519
Delete robinhood. Change your identity. Go off the grid. Good luck comrade,520
Just deposit 105.20 and it will clear your deficit,520
"Don't trade options unless you know what you're doing....

You're welcome",520
You lost ~$100. I don’t see what the big deal is,520
"I’m not an expert on calls so I avoid them but why don’t you just put money into your account to cover the negative so they don’t charge you obscene lending rates?
Edit: After looking more closely, you’re down 100 dollars and on here asking for help….if you can’t afford to cover your possible options and calls why the heck are you doing them at all?",520
Turn phone upside down and it looks better.,520
Deposit more money,520
"Delete the app.
Go to bed.
Sleep like a baby.",520
"Have to just wait until the assignment/exercise is no longer pending.  You lost a total of $300 (minus any credit received when opening) on this trade.  

Assuming you had more than $300 in your account you will no longer be in deficit.  And assuming robinhood didn’t seriously mess up their collateral logic, then you should have had more than $300.",520
Rule 1 don't borrow money!,520
Deposit 105 bucks and then close your account.,520
Where’s the problem?,520
Wolverines!!!,520
Yep. One of the saddest posts in a while on here. Not a joke or big gamble post like we see from WSB. Just some uneducated kid trying to make money in the stock market when $100 clearly hurts to lose.,520

You need to increase your income and get rid of your debt before you invest in the market,522
"Trading is definitely not the way to solve your problems. If anything, it might only make them worse, and the statistics don’t paint all that much a favorable picture. 80-90% of traders end up quitting in their first year. 

Anyone here who might claim to be able to help you is just pulling your strings.",522
"Don't do trading. You're bound to lose your money as for most people is just gambling when they don't really know what they are doing.

Just pick an income that you can invest and pick an ETF. Something like VOO or VTI would suffice. Keep putting money to it for 10 or 20 years without stopping, and you'll be good.",522
"everyone agrees.  Do not invest.  Focus on getting ready to invest first.  Attack the debt, put a little cushion in the bank THEN...........deposit $200 into Robinhood.",522
"90% of experienced traders failed. Solve your credit card debt first. Don't think trading your own money that you will lose, choose another solution like prop firms, the leverage is higher, zero risk, and you trade/lose their money! Follow my trades if you need more advice.",522
"You seem like a pretty good candidate to target dividend paying funds.  The darling of r/dividends is SCHD.  I believe it pays quarterly.  Take a look at that sub... your question gets asked a ton, so there are plenty of posts with suggestions.    Don't think you're going to be buying and selling... it's better to buy, and keep buying to build the bankroll.  This is a 10 year plus plan to get some passive income.

The general consensus on personal finance though is to target paying down the debt before investing.",522
I'm in a similar situation and more of a buy/hold type than trader tho I do have a few pot stocks.,522
"I agree with others that the stock market is NOT a good form of income ESPECIALLY if you’re a normal person. It sounds like you need more income, not a ten year investing plan… but if you had more Capitol than I’m interpreting, JEPI is an interesting income strategy.  Returns are 3x SCHD suggested below. The higher expense rate is still a fraction of the difference.  Some individual companies pay great dividends too… but this really only works with a bankroll.",522
"Well first off you need spare money to invest. Either by making more money or going over your expenses and stripping everything unnecessary, cooking at home, changing phone plans, everything. 

After that don’t become a trader, just invest in SPY, very few traders can beat the market, many loose money. Sorry to say but you probably are not going to be a great trader, I know I wasn’t.",522
High quality stocks. Get on x and follow people that are good at charts. I watch the charts to find a good entry point. That way you’re not immediately a bag holder. Then you either sell or hold. Depending on which stock you buy. Sell quickly on 6 to 10 percent moves.,522
"Thank you very much. I will be checking this out. I'm a smart man I am just having to learn about investing. A ten year plan is what I'm looking for. Again, thank you for your response. Hope you have a great day.",522
there’s this new ipo called a JOB lol. Sorry to be rude but that’s reality for most. You need another or better job. Sounds like you got more time?,522

"Assuming you’ve sold stock recently, it will take at least 2 business days to settle before it can be withdrawn.",529
"You’ll make some lending interest, which would be taxable to you. However, in my experience, I’ve yet to have shared get lent out. It obviously happens, but not with the stocks I’ve bought. Usually, if you’re earning lending interest from a stock, you should sell it because this means big money and people who have made a career out of investing are betting against that stock.

Do note that Robinhood’s FAQ page states that there is a chance that Robinhood is unable to return your lent shares, thus there is a potential liability there. I don’t think Robinhood’s program will ever go bankrupt, but it’s a technical risk.",530
"It's been a couple years but I turned on stock lending as soon as it was available and got some of my shares of SPY and QQQ lent out. 

Made like 20 cents each time or something. Hasn't happened since.

Edit: [nevermind...](https://i.imgur.com/bm2m9hP.jpg)

Looks like I made 2 cents last month...",530
There’s a section about how it affects dividend payments too you might want to read that first before making any decisions.,530
Yeah it's practically worthless in my experience. You'd make more off $10 in interest with RH 4.9% interest,530
"There is no such thing as consent in options trading. They can do whatever they want with the options, whenever they want. That includes exercising the option.",531
In america (other countries have different rules) the buyer of the put or call  can exercise  the option they bought any time it is in the money and do not have to wait for expiration.,531
"If the option is out of the money and they exercise the option, you make money. If it is deep in the money, better hope the spread between the short and long is not huge. I have not tried iron condor personally, but I have been thinking about trying it. If you iron condor is far enough out and has a decent amount of extrinsic value, I doubt it would be exercised early.",531

"Do you all let your out of the money options simply expire and dont worry about it, or do you file a ""Do not exercise"" request just to be safe? I'm fairly new to options and I have some calls expiring way out of the money today. I noticed the wording robinhood uses is that they ""typically"" will not exercise an out of the money option.",539
do not let them expire unless you want a chance of being assigned,539

"Well, are you opening a new position or closing a position?",544
Please don’t get into Options and practice paper trading Options if you don’t know how to sell to close.,544
"If you have an outstanding call or put that you sold, you have to BUY the call or put contract to close it.",544
"Be careful, I thought I knew what I was doing and gambled away $400,000 on options in 16 months",544
Right on. Thanks for the help and advice.,544
"My first time learning what close and open is was difficult and would recomend try them all out on paper trade.

Yes, you would ""sell to close"" the position if your worried about it being excersize.",544
Sorry. I bought options now I want to sell. I think I understand now. I’ve been reading online for hours now. Didn’t know you could sell options without buying first. That’s option writing? Correct?,544
Closing a position.,544
"^^this! Get out and paper trade for a year, this is going to clean you out at this rate. You gotta be confident and sure of what you’re doing, managing, buying or selling. Be sure you fully understand before risking your own money.",544
"You can only sell to open when you have enough collateral. Writing puts has a fixed dollar value collateral requirement according to the option strike price and call writing requires 100 shares per option. Naked calls are only offered by some brokers when you have cash collateral instead of shares bc the risk is unlimited with naked calls unlike cash secured puts (aka CSPs). You can also leverage another option of the same type with a different strike as your collateral. I think Robinhood stopped allowing this though so you can't ""leg in""to a spread by making separate buy to open (BTO) then sell to open (STO) and instead must open a spread position which is the combination of a BTO and STO.",544
"Lol don't worry, if you bought options you are not on the hook for anything. If you want to sell these contracts just put in a sell order and once filled you got rid of it and received cash. When you sell options to open you are writing a new contract which you will be responsible to cover if assigned. Many more nuances but that is basically it. When you buy options, as you stated you did, the most you can lose is whatever you paid to buy them. By the way robinhood won't even let you sell naked options.",544
"It was an all cash deal. You were paid for the shares, you will not get Microsoft shares and they will not be merging.",546
It’s not merging. It’s a buyout not a merger.,546
...why would you get $MSFT shares on top of the $95/share they paid for Activision?,546
"How can I find out if I got that paid out to me? There's nothing that shows I was paid. Also, I have a margin account so I can't tell just by looking at buying power.",546

Try an index fund instead.,556
Welcome to the club.... invest in what you want. Keep reading and learning. There is a lot of moving parts. Chances are you won't get rich quick. But you may build a nice nest egg,556
"Just let your cash sit and earn 5%  in your RH while you educate yourself. Youtube, reddit, investing books, whatever it takes. If you're just going to blindly throw money into something, throw it into s&p 500 fund not stocks.",556
Stop all of those and weekly invest in VOO for the next 10-20 years.,556
"Maybe one other? Bro do you know where your money is going?!?! Lol. Anyways - for someone like you, just weekly buy an index fund like SPY instead of doing what youre doing.",556
"It depends on what kind of investor you want to be, I would hold off on investing right now just because of how unstable the market is and your almost guaranteed to see a loss right away, start pooling the mony you intended to into a savings account until the market starts to bounce back. In the mean time start watching stock market for beginners videos on youtube so you can decide how you want to invest your money.",556
"Honestly man?  This is a tough market to start in lol. Shit could really hit the fan or could not. Maybe split 50% DCA and 50% cash and start dumping the cash when it seems like the market has finally capitulated. 

Zero crystal ball. But the writing on the walls seem pretty eerily bad",556
"VTI is an index fund of the total stock market. SPY or VOO for S&P 500 (Top 500 largest companies. Already has exposure to Tesla). QQQ for NADAQ (100 largest companies). IWM for Russel 2000 (2000 mid/small companies). DIA for Dow Jones Industrial Average. 

On a long-term, historical basis, in 30 years' time, you *should be up. Then again, after the crash of 1929, it took 30 years to break even. But if auto-deposit had been a thing back then, the 29/30 years would have ended positive. Only the money invested at the top before the crash would have taken 30 years to break even. 

If you are not looking to pick up the equivalent time commitment as a new part time job/6 college credit hours for the rest of your life, then stay away from active investing. It is possible to do well, but you have to commit to making the learning/research/news cycle a routine lifestyle.",556
Buy VIX shares.,556
strongly suggest an index fund like SPY for big cap stocks and IJE for small caps.,556
"I suggest investing solely in index funds, as investing in individual stocks with no knowledge or care of learning will only lead to a loss or little gain. It sounds like you are investing for the returns and care little about the process. So try setting up monthly/daily/weekly reoccurring investments into an index fund, up to your preference. I suggest $VTI or $VOO. $VOO is more top heavy with only 500 holdings while $VTI is a total market index. However, their overlap is 86% and their returns are near identical.   
 If you have a genuine interest and want to learn, I would suggest investing in individual stocks with **small sums** of money. This would a great way to start learning. If you genuinely do want to learn or have any questions about index funds I am happy to help answer any questions you might have! Good Luck! :D",556
"Do this you said it yourself, u have no clue what your doing voo and acouple others forget about it.",556
That is 500 different companies.,556
Add the same amount from the right bank account,557
Let me google that for you ffs - https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/how-to-prevent-bank-transfer-reversals/,557
Just transfer the money from the correct account to the wrong account immediately.,557
I did that and if you don’t invest that money Robinhood will return it automatically and make your balance 0 again and same goes for your account. They will get the money back.,557
"Ive done this before. Say you deposited 10k into RH but your bank had 0 due to wrong account (as in your case). You can withdraw the same $10k from your RH back into the bank account to effectively cancel the transfer.

Hope this helps!",557
If it was today you can cancel the transfer in your menu.,557
They’ll just close it,557
Are you an natural language generative AI? That was some AI type answer,557

Use SGOV if you want to make over 5% dividend.,561
SGOV,561
"ironically I have moved and rolled over IRAs and looking into this myself. 

The sweep account in non qualified trading account earns 4.9% so fine there 

IRAs don’t have a sweep yet as I inquired. 

so looking at like GSY NEAR and GBIL rn, but open to other ideas",561
To use for what exactly?,561
"If you buy Robinhood gold they’ll let you earn interest on your idle cash, that’s the closest thing they offer as far as I know",561
Be patient and get your roth or ira over 25k when you swing trade you be making kore than those interest from sweep. Just turn your account to a margin account. Under 25k you cant pattern day trade. As long as you have 25k in stocks ans cash eod youre allowed too. So i suggest 30k in stocks incase it dips,561
Literally any other MMF?,561
USFR. 5.4% right now.,561
"I like SGOV, TFLO, FLOT",561
How would you expect us to be able to give you any better an answer than what you could come up with?,562
No,562
No just give me the money I’ll do it for you,562
If u want,562
Insider trading is your best bet,562
"No, you're not a stock analyst. Picking stocks leads to lower expected returns than broad market index investing.

Other people with infinite amounts of money, knowledge, skill, and experience got in on this trade a long time ago. You also could be right about GTA and still lose money because Rockstar is only one part of Take Two and is not the entire business.",562
No.,562
Honestly school is back in full swing and peanut butter sandwiches are probably being made by moms all over. Definitely by some peanut options and sell your pool noodle stocks as its going to be a cool winter.,562
what is the ticker symbol?,562
"Hell even the wealthiest and best managed funds fail to consistently beat the market. 

Unless you want to play the market like a casino, or run a dividend portfolio, investing into anything other than index funds is a dumb move.",562
"A good place to start is ETFs. Exchange traded funds that invest in multiple stocks in a single index or industry. VOO is the go to if you just want a good long term place to invest in the S&P 500 and ride the market into the sunset.

If you want a little tutorial ETF, you can also put your money in SGOV. SGOV invests in short term treasuries and pays you a monthly dividend. Very safe. Even if the government shuts down tomorrow, they still have to pay their treasury bills. It's a good etf to learn how dividends and investing works without worrying about market swings. You can sell the shares anytime and then invest in something else later.

Personally, SGOV is safe enough for me that even my emergency fund is in there.

For individual stocks, invest in what you know. If you're in a store, see what brands people are buying, look up that brand's company and you can find financial reports. Listen to news, read articles, look at past dividends, if a company has them; it's more work but can be rewarding. Just stay away from meme stocks like gamestop until and unless you know what you are doing.",563
"Remember this. Get rich slow , don't try to do it quick",563
Investopedia is pretty much a one stop shop for everything you’d need to know about stonks,563
I don't understand why people getting into investing insist on individual stocks.  I am a seasoned investor and most of my money in the market is in ETFs...mostly broad based.  I waited until I had a LOT of experience before I moved to individual stocks,563
"Grab some SPY shares for a safe bet and some companies you know and like. Ford, McDonalds, Tesla…..",563
Don’t do stocks. Do ETF’s. ETF is a collection of stocks. It’s a safer less due diligence option. And spreads out risk.,563
"Choose 10 stocks/ETFS. Set up an automatic deposit for the amount you want to invest monthly, then divide that by the 10 stocks. Money comes out of your account and is invested automatically…one of the best ways to have consistent success. 

VOO would be an example of a great ETF to invest in.",563
"QQQ, SPY, VTI",563
"1. Go to the library and check out a few books, read them and take notes. Check your notes and look for the advice that is the same from each book.

2. the easiest thing to do is invest in a S&P 500 fund and let it sit for years, keep adding regularly and don’t worry about the times it goes down (this strategy is only good if you’re young and have a lot of time in the market)

3. Don’t take advice from people on Reddit.

4. Are you investing or trading?",563
How old are you? You have emergency account? Any other investments?,563
"If you want to own individual stocks, I'll give you the advice my grandfather have me. He was very smart about the market. Pick companies that have been around for years where you use their products and services and so do others that you see in a daily basis. Then watch their stock for a bit. If it seems to fit in with your investment plan, buy some shares. Start with a strong foundation and then you can start to take risks. Otherwise, ETFs are the way to go if they fit into your plan.",563
80% TESLA 20% PLTR,563
"SQQQ, SPXU, REK.",563
VOO,563
Ford 🤔,563
"Trades OTC under the ticker ANPDY, but is not available on Robinhood.",564

"AAPL… every week, especially given the prime time attention to FUD stories, e.g. WSJ Qcom hit piece and the usual compliment of ‘supply chain issues’ that will arrive like clockwork within the following 12-16 weeks.

That said, I am concerned about the thermal issues and I’m looking forward to Apple’s response to those as they are customer facing. Nothing gets Apple Management’s attention like something that’ll impact customer satisfaction of the iPhone product segment.",567

"You pay taxes on gains. Gains = price you got minus price you paid. As long as that is zero, no taxes. You will still have to file the forms but the net is $0. No matter what tax bracket you are in, any percent of zero is still zero.",568
You if there was no gains then there is no tax.,568
"""do I have to pay taxes on that?""  
The ""that"" in your sentence is gains.  If you buy a stock for $15 and sell it for $15 the next day, what are the gains?",568
It depends. If you make a profit - you pay short term capital gains. If you take a loss - capital gain loses,568
I don’t think you understood the assignment.,568
Ok,568
"Cringe is right. I’m guessing, hoping this is satire. If not, take a deep breath, and get off the stock market. Robinhood took nothing from you. Try reading before putting your money in to something you clearly have zero understanding of.",569
"Sounds like a reverse stock split. That's something the company did, not Robinhood. The value remains the same. Check the wording. A 1 for 10 reverse stock split would give you 1 share for every 10 you owned. The value of the previous 10 shares now equals 1 share.",569
Your actually lucky robinhhod don't charge you for reverse splits like etrade charges I think 65 every time a split happens I have lost 1500 to 1 shares before.   I did the same thing bought thousands of early marijuana stocks from etrade and lost 90 plus percent from reverse splits. We as owners and everybody who owns votes to have reverse splits from proxy and I have never had reverse splits work soon as I hear I sell my stocks now,569
"They didn't, sounds like a reverse split. I'd need to know the stock to find the specifics.

Basically, ten 1$ stocks become one 10$ stock. It's usually done by really bad companies.",569
"They didnt take your shares. Please research what a stock split and reverse stock split do. A 1 to 10 split means for every 10 shares you own, you get one share.",569
"If this isn’t just a troll, it’s called a stock split or a reverse stock split. 

They didn’t take anything from you. If you went from 100 to 20 that means they did a 5:1 split, which would mean that each of your 20 “new” shares are worth 5x what the old shares were worth. Literally nothing was lost.",569
Robinhood had nothing to do with a suck stock,569
😂😂😂,569
😂,569
You said it yourself YOU DONT UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS then before you start investing do some research read! How things actually work before you come down here and blame Robinhood lol,569
"Sounds like a 1:5 stock split, so the value should be the same but less shares. This was done to keep the stock listed as the value had fallen below the minimum. Without knowing the ticker it’s hard to offer you more information.",569
"Reverse stock split: “When a company completes a reverse stock split, each outstanding share of the company is converted into a fraction of a share. For example, if a company declares a one for ten reverse stock split, every ten shares that you own will be converted into a single share.” 

No one “took” your shares and whatever shares you own now should be worth the same as they were before the split. This has no effect on anything except the share price of the stock, which in your case should be 5x what it was before.",569
"…

Google stock split and reverse split.",569
Call Robin Hood and order them to give your shares back - like the Domme you claim you are.,569
...like ACB (Aurora Cannabis). By God that was the worst call on my part.,569

If you have a margin rate of 8% and tbills are paying ~5% then you're losing 3%. You also can't directly buy tbills in Robinhood.,571
"Wow is this question a tough one. Margin call rate? You mean margin rate? Interest rate? You pay 8% on borrowed money. T bills make about 5.4%. How can you possibly make money? You’ll lose big time! Besides, you cannot buy T bills on Robinhood. Your question is very confusing. Care to elaborate on your thought process here?",571
Using margin in this high rate environment is a suicide mission. For your sake I truly hope you don’t try it!,571
"Per Robinhood: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/minimum-margin/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/minimum-margin/)

“Robinhood Financial charges a standard margin interest rate of 12% and a margin interest rate of 8% for customers who subscribe to Gold. The margin interest rate is calculated by adding 6.5% (for non-Gold customers) or 2.5% (for Gold customers) to the upper bound of the Target Federal Funds Rate, which is set by the Federal Reserve and is subject to change without notice.”

This would eliminate your T-Bill gains (which is also taxed federally) plus some.",571
Dammit you found the unlimited money cheat.,571
"You're about to take a detour on the highway to 'can't miss easy money'! 😅 T-bills, meet Robinhood's margin policy.",571
Do you even do math?,571
Don’t hold anything on margin unless you fully expect to make at least 6% from yearly dividends or a 6% increase in the next year bc you will be paying daily 6% to hold it,571
So you're saying theres a chance,571
They sell etf and funds that match close to tbill rates. But of course margin rate is 7-8% and tbills max out at like 5.4 so this would be dumb.,571

"Don't paraphrase. It reads...

> All investments involve risk and loss of principal is possible.

This means you can end up with less money than you started with. Standard disclaimer for all brokerages because people convince themselves that stocks only go up.

"You're better off opening a HYSA with no fees and a higher rate. I'm getting 5.25% right now, and there are several banks/credit unions around that mark as well.",573
There is free savings accounts that offer 4.75% APY.,573
"“Through brokerage cash sweep, the eligible uninvested cash in your brokerage account (unrestricted cash intended for investing that you have not yet invested or spent) is swept to these banks where it becomes eligible for FDIC insurance up to a total maximum of $2 million (up to $250,000 per program ban”",573
"First and foremost, they lure you in with 4.9% however, they don’t tell you this…

I’ve done the math and unless you use Gold for other benefits, the 4.9% APR is only worth it if you have at least $1300 in there due to the $5 fee. If you have less than $1300 the fee costs you more than you’d gain in interest in a month.

Also the savings account is FDIC insured… it’s not like you’re investing that money.",573
"Remember, even gravity can't resist the temptation to bring stocks down sometimes! Risky business, folks!",573

These things shouldn't need to be explained but they made it seem like it was info being kept from you.",573
"Sell the put, you’ll make more than buying 100 shares then exercising",574
"I assume you bought a put, not sold one. If you bought the put and it's in the money, you can exercise it if you have the funds. If not, you can just sell the put for a profit.",574
"Yes, if you exercise Robinhood will buy the shares for you and then sell them. However most people don't have the cash on hand to exercise the option so they will choose to sell the option for a few dollars less.",574
"In most cases, it is better to STC the option before it expires instead of exercising it because of the extrinsic value of the option.",574

Be careful with companies that have very high debt and low cash. You have to understand why they have the debt and what they use it for. For instance ENB has market cap of around $66B and debt of $67B. This is very high leverage and the interest rates are getting higher. What did they need the money for? Can they keep paying such a high dividend? And many more questions you should find answers for to evaluate the investment.,578

"Options are more risky than buying stocks for several reasons. 

You have to not only correctly guess the direction, you also need to get right the timing. In addition you need to absorb the cost of the option before you can make money.

The investors in an option can include not just those trying to guess the future direction of the stock, it includes people hedging other trades they have going on. Their activity further increases the demand for the option and in turn the price. Expensive option premiums make it even harder for you to make money.

You can make a lot of money successfully trading options, but you can also lose a lot of money and get taken out of the game. Skill increases the chances of success but does not guarantee it. You can't think away all the risk with trading an option.",582
"There's a lot of advice in this thread already, but let me give you the best piece you'll get all day.

Do not trade options until you really dig into some research on them.  Properly done, options can really limit your risk... but done poorly, you'll burn your whole account out and not know what happened.

TDAmeritrade has some excellent training for free on their site.  There's projectfinance on youtube who has a ton of great training.  Tastytrade has a lot of beginner youtube and blog-style training.  SMB Capital is great, but more advanced, and sometimes it's hard to tell whether what they're teaching is good for beginners or not.

Get really familiar with how they work before you start putting money in them.  If you have the patience for it, do some paper trading... though I have to admit that I never had the patience for it and skipped that part.",582
"Time decay is not the only thing you need to consider and is the basis for how different options strategies work. You can look up an explainer on the Greeks

In many strategies including just calls and puts you can only lose the money you put in. But with level 3 or selling naked puts etc, you can have unlimited losses.

Imo because options expire eventually, options trading is pure gambling whereas you can see stocks as investing.",582
"Options are a way to leverage yourself since you’re buying 100 shares of a certain stock. In a call option, you might just be risking your premium but some people actually do use margin to buy more contracts and risk debt. But sometimes, you might have to buy up the shares in the case where you are selling a put etc.",582
I am new (2 months in) and I haven't even made a trade yet. But I studied options and found out that when you buy options the only risk is losing what you spent. At least this is what I gathered so far. I have read a lot of loss porn articles and options can be very scary and dangerous. Before trading them I would diffidently learn it front and back. I know this isn't much help . But if everyone is saying to be careful we better listen.,582
"As somebody who has traded options and knows nothing about them, they suck

For one thing, I’ve bought option calls multiple times where stock price went above strike price and the option was still losing money. In fact, this has happened to me so many times

Vice versa with puts and the stock price going down. I’ve essentially concluded that options suck if ur not betting on high volatility

Additionally, 

If you make 3 “day trades” in a certain period of time, ur account can lock and options can expire worthless. If you do it on margin, then you owe everything

"I am not experienced but I have bought some long calls and puts and observed how much they fluctuate from tiny changes of the underlying. Someone please correct me if anything is wrong in what I say. 

If you own 100 shares of XYZ and it goes down from $100 to $99 a share, you lose $100 or 1% of your investment. 

If you own a call option on XYZ with strike price $100 that cost you $120 (100x$1.20), and the stock goes from $100 to $99, you lose $50 or 41.6% of your investment (delta is 0.5 for ATM option). Close to expiration you lose nearly the entire value of the option. 

Of course, it works the other way - if the underlying gains $1, the option gains 41.6%. 

So you just have to be careful because if you buy a lot of options and guess wrong about the movement of the stock, especially close to expiration, you lose a huge percentage or even the entire investment. Whereas if you just own the stock, even if it goes down 20%, you still have 80% of your investment.",582

If you sell an option, that premium or credit is your max gain. In that instance (selling options) you want the option to expire. You hope the stock stays OTM and you get to keep the premium.

"Generative AI may help the security analyst but it wont do jack all to help protect anything.  
Narrow precision AI (aka machine learning) is already part of MSFTs products and it terrible. In the latest Mitre ATT&CK Endpoint Evalutaion Microsoft once again showed how bad they are compared to other players.  


Chat GPT can help but it wont revolutionize IT security.  


AGI  (General AI) might be a different beast but at the moment its fiction and when or if it comes to market we will see the impact is has.  


One thinge we have definately seen is, that any new technology is nearly instantly adapted by the attackers while  the organisations trying to defend are playing catch up.   


Microsoft will have to significantly improve their security offerings otherwise the cyclical nature of security means they will start losing any gained market share starting in 3 years.  
They are behind in every catergory of solution compared to competing vendors. Many vendors protect more environments than Microsoft. Some even have more protections for Microsoft environments than Microsoft supports...  


Now lets talk ""the autonomous SOC"". The SOC or CDC is the command center where data is analysed for threats and incidents and once discovered responses are coordinated and issued. Threats  are analysed and secruity gaps that are identified then closed. Microsoft currently has many tools that are being used in such a SOC environment. the average SOC uses somewhere between 20-30 different tools for their work. World Class SOC have been observed using 50-100 different tools to do the job.  


Here tool consolidation is the game as well as automating as much as possible before a human needs to review. But Microsoft has 9 tools where companies like Palo Alto Networks has issued a product that can do it all in 1, some customers have reportelty 90-95% of automation achieved already.  
Microsoft and App-Logic can automate basic tasks but its very labour intensive and only moves the work but does not reduce it. Switching and maintining multiple tool is also a reason manual workloads are high and moreover gaps for security increase with compelxity and many tools deployed/maintained.   
Further other Hyperscalers like Google Chronicle are also catching up on a single platform automation first solution, quicker than Microsoft appears to be innovating.  


I would not underestimate the ability of Microsoft but I think the sentiment currently is to significanly overestimate their capabilities.

This is most definitely not true.   Google is so much better at security compared to Microsoft in ALL realms.

"The tech bubble is supported by quality companies that can back up their PE with earnings and growth. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and NVidia are backing it all up. 

If you want to bring some trash companies into the discussion fine, but that’s not what is driving the market and those exist in any market and doesn’t define a bubble.",592
"You’re not taking into consideration capital allocation and efficiency from the Covid bubble. Most of that capital has already been put to use, for those reasons it’ll be hard pressed to see the markets ever coming down to 2019 levels.

NVIDA showed us there’s a lot of demand, which kicked off the craze but we really don’t know the extent of this new market. Eventually reality will set in but bubbles can go on for a long time.

AMD with that high of a P/E during a cyclical slump is meh; I’d be worried after the cycle turns and it has a high p/e - that’s when you can really see how overvalued it is. 

IDK, you make some okay points and there will be corrections in these stocks because of the concerns you brought up, but there’s almost a TINA feeling to big tech and something tells me they’ll continue to work until the companies themselves lose dominance but that’s not on the horizon yet, though it’s bound to happen.",592

If you still believe in the stock, average down.",593
"The first time I bought a company I believed in it seemed like a “cheap stock” cause it fell from like a 6b market cap to a 1.5b marketcap. 28 dollars a share to 5.5. “It’s down almost 75% and I like the company”. Problem was the company made almost no revenue and even three years after I bought the stock it never got off the ground.

I averaged down significantly at $2.5-3/share. At one point I was up 25%. “I’m going to hold. This stock could moon. It was 28 dollars at one point.” It fell further. I kept inching in. $2, $1.5, $1 a share. Eventually I came close to capitulation.

And one day the share bottomed out. Actually, one week. And. Was the same week Tesla bottomed last December. I went all in. Bought almost 30,000 shares at 60 cents. The next week it jumped to $1/share and my average was $.8 a share. After nearly two years of holding i pocketed $6000. I was down almost $18,000 at the lowest point.

The truth was, looking back, I should have *never* bought the company. Not even for a *dollar* market cap. Let alone .5-1.5 billion. I kept convincing myself that it would take off. But the truth was it had scam written all over it and the more I invested the more I tried to believe it was worth it.

So in my opinion, averaging down only makes sense if it’s a good company that is 100% proven. Intel, AMD, Amazon, MSFT. People who bought near the highs and bought lower are sitting good now. But there’s a lot of companies where that wasn’t the case",593

"I think you’re stuck in a psychological trap here: you’ve invested in stock A and its value has gone down. Ie, you’ve lost money in A. Instead of thinking what stock you think is the currently best one to buy with your remaining money to recoup your losses, you think about how to recoup them by investing in A.

This is a very common mistake, believing/feeling that every investment in a specific stock must be profitable rather than looking at your total investments doing good. If you invest in stocks A, B and C, it’s fine if A loses money but B and C more than make up for it.

So stop thinking about profits & losses in specific stocks, worrying about how to make your A investment profitable, and start looking at the greater picture.",593

Averaging down on a stock with no indication of future climbs is a great way to waste money.,593
"I’d argue that for a broad market ETF it definitely makes sense. If you’re averaging down on SPY and sell some shares a few months later once it breaks even that’s not a terrible idea.

That frees up capital for other things or to allow you to average down again if it starts dropping again. This just gives you breathing room. I’ll add that I’d only recommend this in a Roth IRA or other retirement account where you don’t need to worry as much about wash sales. 

For a single stock it depends. Personally, I have a set percentage in red where I’ll begin averaging down as well as a set percentage I’ll begin selling at a loss in order to move on.",593
"But if you bought a stock at €300 in 2022 and bought more of the same company in 2023 at €270 isn’t that averaging down. 

Or are you saying you only ever buy more shares when they are more expensive than all previous purchases of that stock. So would you be called a average upper haha",593
Not necessarily. A stock’s fundamentals can keep improving while the stock price goes down. If it is a high quality company then it makes total sense to gobble up as many shares as you can afford,593

As they are currently doing the SAS transaction. SAS is already in a very poor position financially and structurally and have struggled for years.   
Probably also coincides with the convenient 5 year lockdown period.  
KLM-Air France won't go under or anything with the government support it usually has. But I don't think the total mix of aircrafts with their current routes is a particularly good fit. Hence they would have a sub-optimal cost efficiency. And probably won't have good performance on the stock market either because of it. On top of airlines in general being a very risky and volatile industry. You would most likely do better just buying low cost index funds. Like S&P 500 or STOXX 600.",598

Usually it's discounted.,598
"This is the best answer, as it usually depends on the offer provided by the company vs the downside of the investment.

In this case airlines are a bad investment, and depending on their situation could even go bust (see SAS). You have to weight this against what the employer is offering ( buy 1 get 1 free, etc)

**1. Technology Sector**: Consider ETFs like Vanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT), which provides exposure to stocks in the technology sector. It's a way to invest in a broad range of tech companies.  
  
**2. Healthcare Sector**: Vanguard Health Care ETF (VHT) could be a good fit. This ETF offers exposure to companies in the healthcare sector, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and biotechnology.  
  
**3. Renewable Energy Sector**: While Vanguard doesn't have a specific renewable energy ETF, you can look into broad ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) funds like Vanguard ESG U.S. Stock ETF (ESGV) or Vanguard ESG International Stock ETF (VSGX), which may include companies focused on sustainability and renewable energy.  
  
**4. Global Diversification:** To diversify globally, consider Vanguard Total World Stock ETF (VT), which offers exposure to a wide range of international stocks.  
  
**Tips for Beginners**  
**- Start with Research**: Educate yourself on basic investment principles, understand the ETFs’ objectives, holdings, and the sectors they cover.  
**- Risk Assessment:** Assess your risk tolerance. ETFs can range from conservative (like bond ETFs) to aggressive (like sector-specific ETFs).  
**- Long-term Perspective:** As a young investor, you have the advantage of time, which is beneficial for long-term growth strategies.  
**- Regular Investments:** Consider a strategy like dollar-cost averaging, where you invest a fixed amount regularly, regardless of market conditions. This can be effective in building your portfolio over time.  
**- Diversification:** While you have interests in specific sectors, ensure your portfolio is diversified to mitigate risks. This means spreading your investments across various sectors and asset classes.  
**- Stay Informed:** Keep up with financial news and market trends, but avoid making impulsive decisions based on short-term market fluctuations.  
**- Resources for Learning**: Websites like Investopedia, Morningstar, and the Vanguard Blog offer valuable insights. Books such as ""The Intelligent Investor"" by Benjamin Graham and ""A Random Walk Down Wall Street"" by Burton Malkiel can also be great resources.  
  
**Remember**  
\- Investing involves risks, including the potential loss of principal.  
\- It's wise to consult with a financial advisor to get personalized advice that aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance.  
\- Since you're specifically interested in sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy, you might want to allocate portions of your investment to ETFs specializing in these areas, while maintaining a core holding in a broad-market ETF for stability and diversification. Happy investing!",602
I’d just keep it simple and buy a simple mix of VTI and BND depending on your risk tolerance. Generally for someone your age 90-100% VTI is recommended. I’m personally not a fan of non US companies but if you’d like you can also add some VXUS for non USA exposure.,602
"Certain ETFs (particularly VOO and VTI here on reddit) have taken the place of Mutual Funds for the recommended set it and forget it, diversified, long-term investment that makes sense for the average person your age. They offer nearly every benefit of similar Mutual Funds with a little better visibility and liquidity.

However, ETFs cover a huge spectrum, and many hold portfolios focused on specific sectors or markets. These can have large bid/ask spreads, lower liquidity, and much higher risk. These are not a substitute for a diversified, indexed or total-market ETF/Mutual Fund and should be approached with the same caution as trading individual stocks.

Hope that helps!",602
"1) open an account at [schwab.com](https://schwab.com)

2) buy VTI (entire us market index etf)

That's what I did and would suggest to anybody else.  Yes VTI is a vanguard etf, but since it's an etf, you can purchase it at any broker without any additional fees, and schwab is the most helpful broker because of their great customer service. Just my humble opinion.",602

I'll be wary about SPY or QQQ  or other ETF that are heavy weighted on just a few big tech companies.  Check their holding companies!

I suggest you allocate a small percentage of fund say 30% to try to invest like Charlie Munger, learn what he invested and how he picked those stocks.  His approach is buy the consistently profitable companies and just wait for long term. One of his favorite company is: Costco. Study hard and find out why.

"I don’t know about Tesla and XOM (All I can say is be wary of XOM’s dependency on the spot price of oil, if oil prices fall then XOM and other energy companies also struggle, which is why the energy sector is the least correlated to the rest of the market. This means a large part of your portfolio will be effected by energy prices, which can be volatile. This can be seen as a good thing, though, since it introduces hedging into your portfolio’s make-up ((if the rest of the market does poorly, then energy/XOM might still outperform like happened in 2022)). Also, watch out for Tesla—very pricey in terms of what you pay for what they currently earn, definitely not a value play)

Berkshire is a solid play. Great business model, amazing management, huge moats, highly diversified, proven success, and more importantly a long-lasting fundamental approach to investing, one that has and likely will continue to stand the test of time.

In terms of FSPG, of the following…
Small-cap value
Small-cap growth
Large-cap value
Large-cap growth
…large-cap growth has historically provided the second best returns, only being beaten by small cap value. It’s good if you want low-risk at the slight expense of returns.

All in all, decent portfolio with medium risk.",606

My question is, why are you, as a new investor screwing around picking individual stocks when it's been proven over and over again that buying an S&P index fund will outperform most portfolios?

Yes, you have actually witnessed someone admitting that they were wrong on the internet ;-)

This might also explain why CVNA was able to make so much money off each car. If they are meant to give out 4-6% interest on these subprime loans and they are actually collecting 15-20%, then I would guess the rest could be used as profit if people are not defaulting as would be calculated.",609

"Three lines of response, all intended S constructive.
1) as others have said, your private investment is not liquid.  You can’t sell it to someone else easily, or at all if there are covenants preventing private sale.
2) investing in startups is very risky because most lose 100%.  Stick with public markets until you understand from research and conversations with others the nature of startup investing
3) approach your existing investment positively.  Ask how you can help them succeed, or suggest a way if you can see one.  Don’t antagonize your friend about the money.  You’ve already committed and ultimately that’s on you, so the best option is to help do what you can to make it a success.  

There are a few possible outcomes:
- startup exits and you keep your friend
- startup exits and you lose a friend because you antagonized about the investment 
- startup fails and you lose money and a friend 
-startup fails and you lose money but keep the friend and learn an invaluable lesson 

To guide your efforts: make an effort to keep the friend and if possible help the company succeed.",610

"Let's get some easy stuff out of the way:  


> digging a little deeper, I found that the average age of the S&P 600 is actually 40 years old.

This is simply the survival bias effect taking place. Since most companies die, and small cap stocks are more likely to go bankrupt or be bought out than large caps, the index of companies that currently exist will be older.

>I looked into the valuation history of the small-cap world (ok, just the S&P 600) and I was surprised by the size and persistence of the valuation spread between large-cap (S&P 500) and small-cap (again, S&P 600) companies.

This is also expected on two fronts.

1) It is easier to be large-cap if you have a higher P/E as the market cap is a reflection of P. Thus, larger-cap companies are more likely to have higher P/Es simply mechanically.

2) Small cap stocks are riskier and less likely to have wide moats like large-caps, thus we should expect them to be on balance cheaper.

I invest in small-caps because there are more companies in the small-cap index that have high academic factor exposures. The factor exposures of AVUV is higher than AVLV for example.

As you can see if you look out further into history, your data is extremely small pool of recent years, right now the P/E multiple of large cap companies are in their 90th percentile relative to small caps. Small caps are cheaper now and I see that as a good opportunity. I expect factors to perform.

To be honest I dislike the Russell 2000, I think it is a bad index, so maybe I do agree with you a bit.",616
"The reality is Mid-caps have outperformed small and large-caps over the last 10 years.

Of course past performance doesn't guarantee future results...

Anyways I think that it is best to keep a diversified portfolio which consist of good companies and DCA instead of trying to time market and guess throughout your investment journey but each their own",616
I wouldn't invest in small cap indexes. The thing is ppl buy the largest companies for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with valuations. Large caps will continue to outperform unless something big changes.,616
"If you buy SMLR, sure you will beat the big caps. But half of the Russel 2000 are soon to be bankrupt companies",616
"Some great points and I agree with you for the most part. Obviously survivor bias is the main reason for the average age, since you either move up to Mid/Large or you effectively cease to be. I think the point I was poorly getting at is that I expected the churn out be higher instead of just zombie companies.

Regarding your second points: 1) I don’t think the high ‘P’ in the P/E of large caps really makes much of a difference. Average market cap in S&P 600 is a few billion and in the 500 it’s like $30 billion, so it’s not like a few extra P/E handles will make you jump indices. 2) It’s not that elementary that because small-caps are riskier they would trade at a discounted multiple. Relative valuation multiples are a function of a lot of things and I just figured the increased growth (which appears to not really be as strong as I assumed) would be strong enough to compensate for the implicit riskiness, which doesn’t seem to be the case. Be

Curious about your factor stuff. Never really used them in as an investing criteria, only just as part of our portfolios risk management. Beyond size what are good small-cap specific factors?",616
"Furthermore in the US, there are a large number of small cap banks.  That's peculiar to US financial system and not generally replicated in other countries. They either stay small or are purchased.",616
"100% agree. Just think in my portfolio, if I do hold small-cap it’ll probably be single names and not ETF. Diversifying into junk is probably not a good long-term strat",616
"Taxes apply when selling, not when holding.",617
"Take the original purchase price of the stock minus the sale price, that is your profit.  That profit (only) is taxed.  If you make $5,000 and are taxed 20% (based on your tax bracket) you pay $1000 in taxes.  

Do you have an accountant?",617
I want to sell the stock to pay off a bill and then rest is going back into my IRA account,617
"Definitely talk to an accountant/financial advisor.

 What my people tell me to do is sell what I need to cover whatever today and then use Jan 1st til April 1st ish to sell stuff for tax purposes if needed.  Make sense?

Let’s say I need $5000 but I will owe $1500 to taxes.  I would sell $5000 in 2023, and then figure out in 2024 between Jan and April if I need an extra $1500 to cover my taxes. Then the $1500 taxes would be deferred till 2025.  Make sense?",617

Position?,618
This stock is all about is there going to be a recession and are people going to start to pull back discretionary spending. It got waaaayyyy ahead of itself with the TopGolf merger and I miss when it was a pure play golf stock. TopGolf is fun but expensive just like regular golf but a different subset of people. I have ignored it for the last few years after losing shares to CCs in 2021. At $12 I’m a buyer and Sold CSPs at $12.50  for 1/19 before earnings with assignment at $11.68 and after drop Sold the $7.50 CSPs I’ve already closed for a win and turned profits into free shares. 23 year value investor and only care about Fundamentals not FOMO. If I get assigned this is a solid spot to be in. If we hit a recession I’ll Sell Leaps on my shares and turn that into more cheap shares.,618
Idk top golf is spending to me much offers with visa and Amex to make it seem like their business is thriving. Like if I ever go to top golf I’m almost getting a 10-20% discount on top of all the discounts they are offering. That’s my DnD if a brand is doing good there marketing teams isn’t paying Amex or visa to sponsor offers,618

"I’ll let you in on a little secret. You possess the most powerful investing  tool to reach your goal: TIME. 

The earlier you start investing, the longer the runway you have to grow your assets and if an investment pays a dividend, to harness the most magical power in the universe: COMPOUNDED INTEREST. 

Combining time in the market with compounded interest can build you a fortune. Forests don’t grow overnight. A tree grows slowly at first and accelerates over time. Time can heal the inevitable mistakes you will make from investments that don’t pan out as well as inevitable recessions and bear markets. 

Make time your friend. Be patient. A well managed temperament can protect yourself from being impulsive. In fact, a strong stomach is more important to successful investing than a massive intellect. 

I did not have any opportunity start investing until I was 45, putting me at a considerable disadvantage to you. Yet I was able to build up a portfolio if more than $1.5 Million (I’m now 70.) That’s not a lot. But I know that if I manage my portfolio intelligently, that I will see the greatest growth and acceleration in my portfolio in the next 10 years than I did in the previous 25.

Do your homework. Live frugally and keep putting all that you can into your investments. I’m confident that having time (your new best friend) at your side, you will realize amazing results. 

Best of success to you.",620

When you die you can't take the money with you as long as you do your best and if you have children you give them everything you have. 💪",620
Long term growth is a crap shoot. I prefer to make money IMMEDIATELY with dividends. Create a div portfolio made up of monthly payers. Enroll them in the Dividend Re-Investment Program (DRIP).

"Easily possible at your age. I had less than that at thirty and over a million by forty. 

Right now you just need to focus on growing your income, probably by getting a good job after you finish your degree. You’re not going to invest your way to riches with $65k. 

Max out your tax free contributions and put the investments in something passive like S&P 500. 

Consider buying real estate if the market resets and rates and prices both drop. Get a first time homeowners loan and buy a house or duplex that you can live in and also rent out. You will get a better interest rate because it’s your primary residence. Make sure the rent covers your full mortgage payment. Move after 1-2 years and do this again. After 10 years you will own several houses that other people will be paying for and some will be providing positive cash flow.

Don’t waste time picking stocks now unless you happen to enjoy it or believe that you are extremely lucky.

Another site I use for super investors’ holdings, this is where I start my research: https://www.dataroma.com/m/home.php (Free, I don’t know who created it). Basically, if I spot multiple well known investors buying the same stock, then I will research it.

"Whatever you do trust your gut instinct. I got scammed by an Asian (Singaporean) girl too. I first invested $3k+ and suddenly I was participating in a mining pool reward Which needed me to deposit 15k to be able to withdraw my money plus 30k USDT + 18ETH such a big reward sounded the alarm and I started researching. I run diagnostics on the DApp and it turns out to be 2 months old. And this biach said she has been mining for about a year. I was about to put my 12k to make 15k. I would have lost all my savings if I dumped all my money to the scammers. Thank God I saved my 12k. I cut all kinds of contact with them. I blocked and reported, I contacted the wallet customer service but they said they have hundreds of these sites in black list but they can't do much about it until was recommended to '' Wrath_hacker on instagram who helped me recover all my stolen funds back. If you're a victim of scam I recommend you report the issue to 'Wrath_hacker on instagram to get back all your stolen money back from those scammers.",632

After putting in $200K, 1 gained over $600K trading total. She then said there is a better way to make money and lots! So she recommended a mining site, even before I could read it, she was so persistent and said I ""guarantee it"" again. She's been right before! What could go wrong!?!?

"APY, meaning Annual Percentage Yield, is the rate of interest earned on a savings or investment account in one year, and it includes compound interest.

In general, if you don’t know what some thing is, YES…it is likely risky to you.",647

The annual yield. I'm trying to figure out how it works. And also how it helps me and how it could potentially hurt me,647
"I can not tell you your degree of risk that you are willing to endure.

I don't know that answer",647
">. 

Okay... you are truly starting out new.  Annual Percentage Yield is that amount of money you make or lose on an investment.  If annual percentage yield is positive, you make money.  If annual percentage yield is negative, you lose money.  APY and APR... Annual Percentage Rate are slightly different.

Most often, APY and APR are usually referred to in Savings accounts and there is no risk associated with that.

Let's say you put $1000.00 in a savings account on January 1, 2024.... at an APY interest rate of 4%

January 1, 2024... you deposit $1000.00

come January 1,2025 you'll have $1040.00 in your account.  4% more due to the interest earned.",647

"Your questions sounds as if you know more than you are letting on here or you researched things before.

Are you simply asking questions to verify if what you heard or read is correct?",647

"I’ll say that you SHOULD NOT BE INVESTING ON ROBINHOOD AT ALL.  

You will lose money.   

Not being rude, but you do not understand even the most rudimentary basics yet.  Your best bet is to get a high yield savings account at Citibank or similar.   You will earn 4.5% APY with no risk.  

Then, you need to read and read and read.  Learn.  You are starting from where all of us started…. Zero.  There’s no shame in that.   But do not make the mistake of diving into waters when you don’t know how to swim.

I wouldn't say that Dividend stocks are a waste of time.

"I have a blog post that I wrote up for a family member on exactly what I’d do, it’s #5 on this resources post:

You’re spot on not looking for dividends yet, they sacrifice growth for income typically. I started trading right around when you are when I was in highschool and while I don’t think trading is for most people, it’s unequivocally changed my life. But I spent, literally, thousands of hours on it - it in no way is easy money. So for most, I think buy and hold is hands down the way to go. 

https://open.substack.com/pub/esinvests/p/esinvests-interviews?r=1na2jk&utm_medium=ios&utm_campaign=post",652
I think you should Start by Studying. You can check out some investment website. Open practice accounts with brokers etc an investment in knowledge pays the highest price,652
"I don't know your personal risk tolerance, so I can't give you information regarding your investing in EFTs or into your business.

Whether you invest in growth or dividend-based portfolios, the difference isn't huge regarding returns; however, I highly recommend you do some research into both when creating your portfolio.

If you intend to invest in a portfolio based on dividends, then I recommend the account be a tax-advantaged account (401k or IRA). After all, investing is done so you don't need to be worried about money in your retirement.",652
"Dividends are just one way that cash is returned to shareholders.  Another is through share buybacks.  Either one is fine as long as management is doing it responsibly.  Take a look at ULTA...no dividend, but they use pretty much all of the earnings to buy back shares. The result is that there is always upward pressure on the stock and over time there are fewer shares outstanding, so EPS increases.  Example:  XYZ company earns $1 billion and has 1 billion shares outstanding.  EPS = $1/share.  PE = 20 & share price = $20.

\-If the company pays $1 dividend: Shares remain at 1 billion & over 10 years you get $10 in dividends.

\-If the company uses earnings to repurchase shares: $1 billion per year at $20/share = 50 million shares repurchased in year 1, leaving 950 million shares.  Earnings next year = $1 billion / 950 million shares = $1.05 EPS x 20 PE = $21 share price....  Year 2 $1 billion in share repurchases = 47 million reduced, leaving 903 million shares = EPS $1.10 x 20 PE = $22 share price.

In each case you have received $1 per share in value but dividends get taxed when they pay and share price increases only get taxed when you sell.  This is a simplified example and doesn't account for effective management growing the business, but it shows that there are other ways to receive value.  A third way is for the company to pay down debt (if they have any) because they are paying interest on the debt that comes out of earnings.  Good management will buy back shares when they are cheap and will pay down debt when it will result in higher EPS than share buybacks.  The worst management announces share buybacks when the stock is at all-time highs and trading at values that seem ridiculous.  Also, it's important to look at the cash flow sheet and see if they are buying shares back from one pocket and reissuing the shares from another pocket. This equates to management funneling shareholder earnings into their own pockets.  Nearly every company uses some stock compensation, but some companies are egregious in the amount that they immediately reissue.  Look at BABA and you will see they spend $11 billion on buybacks and $4 billion reissuing shares through stock based compensation.  If you do the math and look at how many shares have been reduced over the last 5 years, you will see they ended up spending $33 billion to reduce by 30 million shares, equating to over $1000 per share for a stock that's trading at $78.  That's wasted shareholder earnings.",652

"There's honestly insufficient data in your post to give sounds advice.

Especially at that salary level.  Could be very impressive depending on where you live... and the cost of living in that area.... Very impressive in San Francisco.... less, but still impressive in rural Texas.

If you're in your 20's... 30's... that's good.  If you're in your 50's... and your house is paid off.... not so good.

"It depends in your financial goals. 

Most people use the ""100-Age"" rule. 

The 100-age rule of asset allocation is a guideline that investors use to determine how much of their investment should be allocated to each asset class based on their age. The rule states that an investor's portfolio should contain 100 minus their age in stocks and the remaining amount in bonds.

Research that rule & see if it is for you. 

Hope this helps.

"Great Question because there's no right or wrong answer to your question anyways SOFI had my attention for awhile in 2023 & I think If you are accumulating at these prices between $6-$7 then you can make a good profit especially if it goes to $16 like tons of people are saying.

Most Investors think SOFI is a great company with a great future.

Yea but there is this link that my friend have that maybe goes to there website but when I googled it I only saw like other links that have trustplus type names and when I Google is TrystPlusNT a scam then I found a whole lot of websites warning about It being a scam.

"The problem with this is that Robinhood already did what an investing app fundamentally needs to be. Make it look like a videogame casino and have people waste their money.

The truth is, optimal investing for the average person (which is who apps are for) is set and forget long term holdings in low cost cap weighted index funds for market exposure. You're not helping anyone by trying to solve any of these problems with an app. No one needs an app to buy 'x' shares of VTI and then set up a recurring deposit from your paycheck.",692

"Q1: ""Is it possible to place a limit order of buying it at 4/5$""

Answer: Yes..  A limit order is an order to buy or sell a stock with a restriction on the maximum price to be paid (with a buy limit) or the minimum price to be received (with a sell limit). If the order is filled, it will only be at the specified limit price or better.

Q2: ""Does the limit order expire?"" 

Answer:  Yes..  Day limit orders expire at the end of the standard trading session and do not carry over to after-hours sessions. Day + extended limit orders are active during all equity trading sessions, from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. ET and are known as seamless orders.


Q3. ""Is there any disadvantage of placing limit order over market order?""

Answer: Yes..  Everything has advantage and disadvantage.  Anyways Market orders execute a trade immediately at the best available price, whereas a limit order only executes when the market trades at a certain price.

Hope this helps..

"Spent my whole day looking into this and now I think FXAIX and VWENX have too many similar holdings in their portfolio. I am now actually leaning towards 25% VSGAX for small cap growth, 25% VSIAX for small cap value and then 50% either FXAIX or VWENX. It’s tough cause VWENX does about 1/3rd bonds which is good for diversification (despite having 30 years to retirement) but FXAIX seems to outperform VWENX",706
"Read this online:  

""FXAIX has consistently outshined most active fund managers over the last 10 years while sporting a remarkably low expense ratio of 0.015%.

Actuaries have to guess what future inflation will be so have to build in a margin for error to protect their profit margin. The customer pays for this.

"I opened an IRA as a side thing to my more boring 401k.  I did it when things were volatile and unrealistic during covid, and the 10-30% gains started to look too easy.  Then sanity crept in.  It turns out that I am not as smart and the market is not so rational.  SO now I am down 30% overall (not really big numbers though) and my boring S&P mutual fund purchase is up 8%.  If I had stuck with boring, I would be up overall.  And my 401k is even better, suggesting if I had just put into that, I would have been much much smarter.  

I haven't done bonds yet.  I want to, but other things have come up.  That 5% return does seem nice though.

"Investing is easy.  Getting rich is not. 

There’s a lot of anti-capitalist sentiment these days. But a lot of the implications about investing are essentially propaganda based on the fact that Uber wealthy people do use investments extensively to manage their wealth and provide for their lifestyle. 

Very very very few people get rich off of investments.   It’s a good way to grow your savings over long periods of time, especially for retirement.  But you have to be very lucky - and probably already wealthy - to get rich purely off of investments. 

The way normal people use investments is very very different from the way the ultra wealthy do. 

You should check out the Bogleheads approach (bogleheads.org).",729
"I realized I didn’t answer your core question. 

In my opinion, the structural criticisms of capital markets are mostly valid.  But we still have to survive and do what’s best for us and our families.  

Investing in stocks does mean you will, inevitably, indirectly support corporations that do unethical or harmful things.  You can try to invest ethically but it severely limits you.

"You simply don’t understand the complexities of doing business. In these seemingly dilly-dallying excursions, the parties build a rapport. They learn about each other outside of a business sense. They learn who has integrity, can be trusted to follow through, who you can count on in adversity who will waffle under pressure. If you think that all of these “fun” things are a waste, I can tell you that my best business relationships were built in these places. There is great value in doing business this way. If not, getting straight to the point would not work out as often as you might think.",732
"To address the initial question, the approach depends on Steve and Oliver's existing relationship, business or personal. In either case it’s usually considered a form of Goodwill if a person organizes an informal event before official discussions take place for any business arrangement.

But this approach will not work with everyone, especially if they feel the other person is only being generous so they can then later ask them for something in return. So meetings or partnerships with people may require different approaches with some starting as informal and moving to formal and others, being strictly formal from the start.

One reason that Steve may not have wanted to work with Oliver could be the fact that he could not control himself which could create consequences down the line if they were to form a partnership.

I believe that when you have an informal arrangement with a person who you may want to partner with on a business venture, it allows you to conduct due diligence to figure out whether or not they will actually be a good person to bring into your network.

To your second point, unless someone has firsthand experience what it’s really like to be in those elite circles we would never know how exactly those different people think. For millennials and the younger generations television shows and movies may have played a role in the misperception of how business people spend their time.

It’s a very sticky question with a challenging answer because going back to the point made earlier different motivations of the individual is what determines their approach when dealing with their associates and potential partners. So I would assume that older businessmen might engage in activities like a round of golf, dining at a traditional restaurant, or enjoying expensive champagne with cigars. On the other hand, younger businessmen might opt for modern restaurants or bars.

Some of these social events may be considered business expenses, generating potential tax and financial incentives. (I’m not an expert in what’s considered a tax write off).

To your last point the reality is that as humans we are driven by fear and greed, and when it comes to business the person seeking a partnership is in need of something that the other person has. And one way they might try to win them over is by making extravagant purchases for that person while picking up the tab and hoping that the generosity gives them more leverage when the official negotiations take place. 

And if the business people already have a good friendship then it’s nothing more than two friends or more, having a friendly conversation and catching up with each other while discussing a new venture that will further consolidate their union as friends and partners.

There are some examples in which potential partners went straight into negotiating stages and they realize that later down the line, it was a terrible partnership. Then there’s others that were informal and were best kept that way, instead of taking the risk of making things official and locking each other in a contract that could then lead to legal disputes and break good relationships.",732
Cuz if I told you let’s hurry up and make this deal you’ll think I’m desperate. so instead I have to show you a good time to get you to open up and trust me,732

"Depending on your investment horizon and discipline it’s always good to hold for the long term even in times of recession so long as you do research on the companies or funds you invest in and believe they will retain and grow their value over time.

Problem with a lot of media and analysts speculation is that even the experts can be wrong and we may never know if a recession is imminent or not so best thing is to research and avoid the noise when necessary and make adjustments that aligns with your investment and financial goals.

You also want to maintain some liquidity outside of the market by having reserves in a low cost fund or account that you can liquidate to get access to cash. You don’t want to have all your money in cash or a bank account with a super low interest return because your money still needs to earn some interest if you don’t want to dilute your purchasing power by just having it sit in cash or low yielding account.",733

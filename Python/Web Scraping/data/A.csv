"I’m a bit surprised there isn’t a VC back tech company that’s figured out how to offer people mortgages at lower than market rates. The rate would be adjustable to offset some FX fluctuations.

Example

China interest rate is 3.45%

Japan interest rate is 3.16%

US interest rate on 30 Yr fixed mortgage is 7.384%

Colombia mortgage rate is 20.120%

Consumer A wants to buy a $500k house. Most US banks offer a 30 year loan at 8-10% interest.

Arbitrage company borrows $500k from Japanese bank at 4% fixed for 30 years. Then offers Consumer A 5.5% ARM with 30% down payment or 6.5% ARM with 20% down payment or 7% fixed with 10% down payment.  

Thesis - japans rates will remain low for the next 5 years, possibly 10 years. Requiring a 30% down payment provides a buffer in times of currency fluctuations and also helps to reduce the investment risk. The down payment also acts as a sort of vetting since few Americans have $1,000 saved up so the ones who have 30% saved up will be pretty safe borrowers in terms of risk. The 1.5-3% interest arbitrage also acts as a buffer. At scale, this could be packaged together and sold to retail and institutional bond investors and that spread would increase the company’s profits per sale. Lastly, homes in the US generally retain their value and due to housing supply shortages, there will be ample opportunities to liquidate. 


It seems that borrowing from foreign banks, regardless of the country, is incredibly hard. Most seem to only do business with their own citizens or people with long history in the country and are residents (green/residency card or passport). I’m in the U.S. and it seems pretty hard to get a loan from a Japan bank for instance. Chinese bank is even harder. I have never stepped foot in any of these countries yet. Colombia seems slightly easier but it depends on which bank location you go to and the employee. 

Also you could expand this to country’s with sky high interest rates such as Colombia. Pitch being that taking out the loan and buying property would help secure a green card or residency in participating countries with investment visa programs. So property values would be stable and probably propped up. As long as credit standards are maintained, there shouldn’t be any real problems like that of the US financial crash.

What do you think?

Update

To further lessen currency risk, you could require buyer put up 10% (in the example $50,000) that would go towards an insurance policy or investment vehicle over the life of the property. At the end of the mortgage, the buyer receives whatever money is left over. If currency remained flat or deprecated, buyer would get full amount, maybe slightly less. If the currency fluctuated harder, then the buyer loses it all. This would still be cheaper than paying market rate interest over the life of the mortgage. I have very little knowledge about insurance so feel free to correct me or come up with a structure that could work."

"# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Audit your insurance coverage!** How long has it been since you examined your coverage or gotten a quote from another company to look for cheaper insurance? As your life evolves, it's important to make sure you update your insurance coverage as well. This is also a good way to save some money if you can find a better deal for insurance elsewhere or if you find yourself overinsured in some specific area.

## Why insurance?

Insurance is an approach to handle the problem of *risk*. Most likely, during your life, one or more of these things will happen: you will be in a vehicle accident, you or someone close to you will experience serious illness or injury, or you will lose your job. Positive events have associated risk as well: ask anyone who has had a child, puppy, house, or marriage.

You can choose to *retain* each of those risks: decide that if the bad thing happens, you can afford to pay for it, to self-insure. For example, if you lose a laptop, you can buy another one. You can also *reduce* the risk, say, by not driving on icy streets or by having chains on your tires.  The other ways to deal with risk are to *avoid* it (don't buy a puppy) or *transfer* it (insurance!).

Most of us don’t think about risk until the bad thing happens. We are in a vehicle crash with an expensive car, someone is injured, and only then it dawns on us that we might be underinsured.

For many major risks, most people share the risk with an insurance company through various insurance products. If you own a vehicle, most likely you will be required by your state to have liability coverage (personal injuries and property damage caused by you). If you have a mortgage, your mortgage holder will require you to have homeowners insurance and some landlords will require renters insurance. Other types of insurance are optional, but may be desirable if available, for example, disability insurance.

## Audit your insurance coverage

Take a minute to think about what insurance coverage you currently have, whether you may be paying too much, and whether your coverage limits are appropriate:

* Car Insurance
* Health / Vision / Dental Insurance
* Life Insurance
* Homeowners / Renters Insurance
* Jewelry Insurance

Although insurance is an important financial tool to protect you against emergencies, it can also be a major drain on your budget. Insurance agents often use the fact that *some* insurance is important to make you feel that *the more insurance you have, the better off you are*.

It's wise to **only insure what you need to insure**. What do you need to insure? Anything that you could not easily afford to replace with your cash savings or where the loss would significantly set you back financially. In the next 30 days, review not only the types of insurance you have, but the level of coverage you have in each type. Here are some ideas for various types of insurance:

## Car Insurance

Assess all the types of coverage you have on your car. See the wiki article on [car insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/carinsurance) for more details and ways to save money. For example, if you drive less than 10,000 miles per year, call your insurance company and see if they provide a low-mileage discount.

Liability insurance is required by law if you drive and is very important: Would you be able to pay out a $300,000 lawsuit if you injure someone in a car accident? Liability insurance is not a great place to skimp.

Coverages for ""uninsured motorists"" (an uninsured or underinsured driver injures you or your passengers) and ""medical payments"" (you or your passengers are injured in an auto accident) are also worth having. They are less expensive than liability coverage and the irresponsibility of others is a major risk.

Also consider whether your ""collision"" and ""comprehensive"" deductibles coverage is appropriate or necessary, especially if you have an older car or significant savings. Eliminating or reducing these types of coverage can reduce your insurance bill, but you'll be left on the hook to replace or repair your own car if you (or mother nature) damage it.

Finally, when you see car insurance advertisements selling you ""better car replacement"" or ""one model year newer"" insurance, realize that this is a **great** deal for the insurer and not as great for their customers. Buying these policies mean that you're paying for a piece of a newer car every single month even though the odds of taking advantage of these policies are relatively low.

## Health / Vision / Dental Insurance

In the U.S., some form of catastrophic health insurance is vital for nearly everyone, as a week in an intensive care unit is enough to bankrupt all but the wealthiest. However, consider your expected use of healthcare services. If you are young and healthy, you may not need to fork over the extra dough for a *Gold* plan with lots of coverage. See the wiki article on [health insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/health_insurance) for more details.

## Life Insurance

Remember the principle of insurance? ""Only insure what you couldn't afford to lose."" If you have children or a spouse that would be unable to maintain their standard of living without your income, *then you may need to insure your earning ability*. That means you take out a term life insurance policy that pays your spouse and/or dependents in the event that you die and can no longer earn money to provide for them. However, if you **don't** have dependents or if your spouse can earn enough money on their own to provide for themselves, you might not need life insurance at all.

It's also important for you to understand that there are two basic kinds of life insurance: term life insurance and permanent life insurance (like whole life or universal life). With term life insurance, you pay to cover your loved ones from the risk of your death. With whole life insurance, a portion of your cost goes to coverage, but it also has a cash value component that grows over time similar to an investment account.

While there may be some exceptions for the very wealthy, term life insurance tends to be the best choice for the vast majority of individuals.

Read our wiki article on [life insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/insurance) for a deeper discussion.

## Homeowners / Renters Insurance

Insurance on your residence is important for almost everyone who owns or rents a home. Owning a house without insurance could be disastrous if it burnt down, because you likely have a mortgage on it and probably don't have $250k cash to replace it. However, it may be worth checking how large your [deductible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deductible) is. If it's only $1,500, you might be able to afford more than *that* in an emergency. If appropriate, you can increase your deductible to reduce your costs. Note that homeowners deductibles are per incident, though. See the wiki article on [homeowners insurance](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/homeowners_insurance) for more details.

Renters insurance policies also tend to be very cheap (roughly $15 per month for $30,000 of property coverage and $100,000 of liability coverage).

Finally, make sure you have an up-to-date inventory of your property so any claims will be easier to make. An easy way to do this is taking a video on your phone as you walk through your home, naming everything as you walk through. Note the make and models of anything expensive like electronics. (Make an offsite or cloud copy of the video too!)

## Jewelry Insurance

Most single-issue insurance policies tend to be [poor deals for consumers](http://clark.com/insurance/insurance-you-can-stop-buying/). Opinions vary on jewelry insurance, but the default assumption of most people is to carry insurance on an engagement ring is more a product of the jewelry marketing machine than actual need. A few factors make jewelry insurance less necessary than other types of insurance:

* Your homeowners or renters insurance may already cover jewelry up to a certain value. Check!
* You should not even be buying jewelry that you couldn't afford to replace with cash.
* Most jewelry insurance does not cover accidental loss or misplacement. Only theft or damage. 
* Consider your (and your SO's) sentimental attachment to the piece. If your wife's engagement ring were stolen or lost, could you replace it with cash savings? Would you have a conversation about the importance of replacing it identically or go for a less expensive piece?

## Another way to save money

One thing to consider when reviewing your coverage is that sometimes companies offer discounts for having multiple accounts with them (e.g., a multi-policy discount or ""bundling""). When you call your insurance company, ask them about these discounts. For some insurers like USAA, you can even get a discount for adding non-insurance accounts like a savings account.

## A note on emergency funds

Following [""How to handle $""](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics), an emergency fund of cash equal to 3 to 6 months' worth of routine expenses is recommended. If you have no collision coverage on your car and rely on it to get to work, and/or a very high deductible on your home insurance ($10k), seriously consider the size of your emergency fund, and whether it is enough to get you through a ""double-whammy"" such as job loss and a car accident at the same time.

## Notes on other types of insurance

The bare minimum for most people is car insurance (if they drive), health insurance, term life insurance (if others depend on their income), and homeowners/renters insurance.  However, there are several additional types of insurance that some people may want to consider.  In particular:

- **Umbrella Insurance**: If your net worth exceeds the coverage limits for your car insurance liability or homeowners/renters liability (or your profession has high earning potential), you should evaluate whether umbrella insurance is appropriate for your situation.  Read more about [umbrella insurance in our wiki](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/umbrella_insurance) if this applies to you.
- **Long-Term Care Insurance**: If you're in your 50s (some financial advisors advise late 40s), you may want to start considering [whether LTC insurance makes sense for you](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).
- **Disability Insurance**: Depending on your situation, [you may want to consider disability insurance as well](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/ltc_and_disability_insurance).

# Challenge success criteria

Previous weeks' Option Questions Safe Haven threads.
  
[Complete archive: 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/archive/safe_haven_2023)

"&#x200B;

Futures are higher this morning following yesterday's Powell (and yields) induced pullback. As we've been mentioning all week the market is taking a bit of a breather from the volatility of the past month. Rallies finding sellers and sell-offs finding buyers is a sign of a market loaded with gamma after a rapid decline in the VIX. Keep an eye on those trends. What usually clears those conditions are either a large expiration (Nov monthly expiry is on the 17th) or market-moving news that is enough to send the indices from a heavy gamma area (strikes with lots of open interest) towards areas of either short gamma or low open interest. 

Even with the red day yesterday, the VIX is below 15 as we enter Friday. The SPX is essentially unchanged on the week. If this week's trading action were to carry over into next week the VIX could see low teens. With that low IV comes very tight expected moves day to day so those selling options for income should be aware of where their strikes are in relation to the underlying. 

When vol is super low a market (or individual stock) will tend to go outside its expected move more often than when vol is super high. The difference being that when vol is super high it may violate the expected move by a lot more while when vol is low it may just go outside barely. So it often makes sense in low vol environments to go a bit wider from the stock, taking in less premium but giving enough room for those slight violations of the expected move to not be a big loser.

"A reminder that the mod team is still waiting for Reddit to let us know about the moon contract. They have told us earlier this week they will get back to us by end of this week.

Update - November about to get booked out for AMAs - last two days being confirmed now. This means we will have 7 AMAs booked for November. :) Note the next one about to go live soon."
"My [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/11ezwar/rate_my_portfolio_rstocks_quarterly_thread_march/jah0b73/) was 6 months ago.

To recap, a brief overview of my strategy, that has not since changed:

> I am 26, so I have several decades until retirement. My goal is to hold the stocks in my portfolio perpetually, though I'm not reserved to make adjustments and sell when a) I see an opportunity to take profits b) my thesis changes. My long term goal is passive income generation, though I don't chase yields. I don't pay much attention to valuation or macro, as I think that since I plan on holding these stocks for decades while buying every month, those don't matter to me much.

> I invest regularly every month, so I'm okay with buying at a higher valuation at times and lower valuation at other times. In my opinion, buying at the best possible time is more difficult than buying a good company. That said, if I see an undervalued stock I like, I don't hesitate to buy more and when I make my regular contributions, I try weigh towards stocks that might have been beaten down or seem undervalued.

> I like stocks that are quality companies with:

> -	A sustainable business model - high cash flow generation, high ROIC / ROCE, good balance sheet. Bonus points for recurring, diversified revenue, and optionality.
> -	Business model and products I understand, or at least understand their value. I don't think I'll ever understand ASML's machines, but I understand why it's one of a kind company.
> -	A wide moat. Bonus points are for brand value, network effect, IP, barriers to entry / high switching costs, supply chain, etc. I am okay with paying a high multiple for a company that cannot be replicated by throwing money at the problem. Almost every company I own scores very high in this regard in my own checklist.
> -	High margins. I focus mostly on gross margin, but consider other margin metrics, too.
> -	Sustainable buybacks and dividend growth.
> -	Great management.

I made some changes to my portfolio:

- I no longer own the CARB carbon allowance ETF. It was good for some hedging but I wanted to simplify my approach a bit.
- I no longer own small cap and EM ETFs. I only have MSCI World ETF (15%) and MSCI World Quality ETF (10%). I wanted to intensify my focus on quality companies and simplify my approach.

- I sold BN & BAM, UNP, LMT, ADBE, JNJ. I was no longer comfortable with Brookfield's structure and my lack of understanding it, so I sold all my Brookfield holdings after almost 4 years I've held them. ADBE had really nice growth and I felt better taking the profits. I like that they will probably adapt to generative AI pretty well. I love the company and might buy back later. UNP, LMT, JNJ are all good but I think I wanted to focus on more innovative (less so with LMT) and consumer oriented businesses (less so with JNJ).

- I bought LVMH, LLY, PM, IDXX, ZTS, L'oreal, META. I briefly held EL which I sold (at loss) and bought L'oreal instead.

- I increased the weights of my core holdings. 6 of my stocks (MSFT, AAPL, ASML, V, MA, NVO) account for >50% of my stocks, 9 (+ LVMH, GOOG, COST) account for 50% of my overall portfolio.

My current holdings:

| **Idexx Laboratories**          | IDXX   |   5,1% |   1,4% |          2,5% |

I view all of these as great companies with a history of compounding and a great future driven by secular trends. I think the themes of my portfolio are pretty clear:

- Big tech with massive cash flows and wide moat (AAPL, MSFT, ASML, GOOG, META). I was hesitant about buying Meta, but the numbers are so good. The semiconductor business is too complicated for my liking, so I tend to avoid those companies (I briefly owned AMD and NVDA a few years ago). ASML is even more complicated, but that's part of the monopoly and it seems like they are decades ahead of any competition, especially with protectionist policies from the US and EU. NVDA matches a lot of what I look for in the company, but I think there is and will be too much volatility, so I'm not buying it.

- Toll booth companies for a world with growing cashless payments (MA, V). Some of the greatest businesses in the world. Not much more to say. There might be competition in the future, but their scale gives them so many advantages.

- Aging society, obesity, diabetes (NVO, LLY, ISRG). NVO and LLY are probably the two best pharma companies in the world. They might seem overvalued, but once you look into the companies, you realize they really are that great. NVO and LLY now also pretty much make miracle drugs with an ever increasing number of patients. Even without Wegovy / Ozempic / Mounjaro they have amazing numbers. Now they'll have walking happy advertisements walking around. The benefits of the drugs clearly outsize the side effects, so once it becomes accessible, it will be great business.

- Quality retail / consumer stocks with loyal customers, good business models, high market share (LVMH, COST, HD, ULTA).

- Luxury, beauty, cosmetics (LVMH, ULTA, L'oreal). LVMH is an incredibly well managed conglomerate, probably one of the greatest in the world. There are companies that are centuries old and it's unbelievable how huge they made the luxury market. I recommend the [Acquired podcast episode](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7lMY1C8AMFinpVMTgAH9D9) about the company. ULTA has incredible customer loyalty and growth. I'm curious if they can expand internationally sometime later. L'Oreal is similarly a giant conglomerate. I at first went with Estee Lauder, but it seems like the next few years will be volatile. I believe EL will be very strong in the future, but I don't want to risk the short term volatility. L'Oreal is very similar and the entire beauty industry is very hard to penetrate because these two companies and a few other have consolidated so much of the market and they will buy out any potentially large competitor. I can't see it ever changing. I can't imagine a future where this trend of skincare, beauty is ever reversed, and it only stands to grow as these generations grow older and healthspans grow longer all around the world. I am sure ULTA and Sephora (within LVMH) benefit from this as well.

- A growing market of pet owners who grow ever closer to their companions (ZTS, IDXX). It's crazy how close millenials and gen Z are to their pets. They are part of family. They are already willing to spend so much on their pets at the expense of their own comfort. As their pets grow older, they will be even closer and they will need to spend a lot on their care. IDEXX has the benefit that diagnostics is much more important with pets as they cannot communicate their symptoms.

- Not really a theme, but for some nice dividends I got a nicotine holding, I went with PM. This is one I've hesitated about a lot. I'm not going to write a whole analysis, since it's such a small holding, but I don't see our society ever leaving nicotine and I expect we will see a huge continuing growth in smokeless nicotine products. This might sound contrarian, but I wouldn't be surprised if nicotine was much more normalized in the future (in decades time) as a supplement similar to caffeine. The winners will almost certainly be big tobacco companies as it is and likely will remain a highly regulated market with high entry barriers. Even if that doesn't happen, I think there is still money to be made in cigarettes, as even though the number of smokers decreases in most of the world, the revenue is not dropping yet. And I think there is a generation of nicotine addicts growing up in most of the world due to flavored vapes and nicotine pouches."

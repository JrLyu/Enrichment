"The goal of this post is to address a commonly cited inaccuracy from this sub, provide peer reviewed and anecdotal information to enable individual decision making. The Tl:Dr is trading is difficult but not impossible and to not allow disenfranchised trolls to make you believe otherwise.

There is a difference between impossible and improbable. I came across a post earlier and one of the comments inferred that there are no profitable retail traders - which is objectively false but is worth diving into. The world of trading is perilous, options trading increasingly so - but it's not impossible.

**Landscape:**

*I'm not going to throw unlimited studies in here, but some recent research. The Tl;Dr for this section is that retail traders typically lose money, but a small subset do. So it is indeed possible to become an outlier from the population.*

* Trading, in general, is a losing prospect. There is a litany of research that backs this comment, it isn't an opinion.
* Daytrading is by far the absolute worst cohort to attempt to ""make it"" they overwhelmingly lose money and this is well studied:

* Yet, outside of this timeframe, there are many instances where retail traders ARE successful

      * The study examined the trading activity of over 10 million retail investors on the Robinhood trading platform between 2016 and 2018. **The authors found that only 2% of retail day traders generated positive returns after accounting for trading costs.**

   * We show that the more disciplined traders are, the more profitable they are. We further show that many traders lack consistency in trading discipline between periods. As a result, their profitability is affected accordingly depending on whether or not discipline is maintained or improved in the subsequent period.
* Losing is Optional: Retail Option Trading and Expected Announcement Volatility [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract\_id=4050165](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4050165)
   * We document the growth of retail options trading and provide evidence that retail investors are drawn to options by anticipated spikes in volatility. Retail investors purchase options in a concentrated fashion before earnings announcements, particularly those with greater expected abnormal volatility. Comparing across asset markets, we also find retail investors disproportionately trade options over stocks as anticipated announcement volatility increases. In doing so, retail investors display a trio of wealth-depleting behaviors: they overpay for options relative to realized volatility, incur enormous bid-ask spreads, and sluggishly respond to announcements. These translate to retail losses of 5-to-9% on average, and 10-to-14% for high expected volatility announcements.

**Why trade as retail if successful?**

This is a common follow on as ""proof"" that there are no successful retail traders, that if a trader was successful they'd set up a fund and become uber rich. This argument stems from the mindset of a person that doesn't have money because that's all it's focused on.

Can a profitable retail trader make more money by managing money, ABSOLUTELY. So why do some not make this transition? I can't answer for others, but my reasons are simple:

* **Bureaucracy**. Managing a fund requires a ton of infrastructure, regulation compliance, limitations on trading approaches, etc. This overhead isn't appealing to me.
* **Stakeholders.** Bosses and clients. The reason I started trading was for freedom, not to make enough money to buy a country. While I fully respect people out to make as much money as humanly possible - I don't share that aspiration. I don't want to deal with reporting to a boss or placating clients.
* **Freedom.** The two primary conditions above drastically impact freedom - the opposite of my objectives with trading. I truly value having complete control over my schedule, what I spend time doing, and not doing the litany of mind-numbing requirements when working for someone (either a boss or clients).
* **Enough.** I did the math long ago on how much money I'd need to amass in order to live my dream lifestyle and not worry about money. While it's completely viable to make more money managing money, ""The purpose is to have enough to allow you to focus on the things that matter. To reclaim your time for deeper meaning"".

**Why interact here if successful?**

While many here view things through their perspective, stepping back to observe someone else's can answer this. Why would anyone be a nurse? It's absolutely baffling to me and not something that would ever appeal to me - yet many move into the field. Same for being an elementary school teacher. What you'll find though, is that as people create ""enough"" they look for the deeper meaning cited above. This is why you'll find successful people donating insane sums of money, typically tied to areas that they have a personal connection to.

So for me, I'm incredibly thankful for the mentors that spend time helping me on my path. I'm compelled to pay forward their effort and thus interact here to do so.

**Path to Trading Successfully**

* I'm going to summarize here but am happy to dive into any specific questions or details.
* I started trading in 2007 on the advice of a high school teacher. He saw me working all sorts of jobs, asked what I was going with my money, and suggested I looked into investing.
* I went to the library, started reading and began. I started with buying stocks and evolved into options < 1 year in. I've since spent over 30,000 hours learning and deploying.
* My first two years were negative, with the worst year being -4.2%
* While in college, I studied stats which absolutely helped me. Same for my grad.
* During college, I also met a mentor - online. I didn't interact with him too much but the input he gave me was pivotal. He led me to create a trading plan, trading log and to take trading far more seriously and less as an interest or hobby. I didn't need my hand held, but I needed the guidance which led me to focus on the right things.
* From there, I started pacing the market, and in 2011 I started outperforming - 5 years in.
* I cannot overstate how important saving is. Early on, this is the absolute most essential path to growing your account. Trading a small amount of money into your future wealth, while not impossible, is insanely improbable.
* I also cannot overstate how important creating a trading plan and log were. Without these, I was inconsistent at best. These guiding documents organized my approach. This structure enabled me to begin backtesting with specificity and learning how to optimize my approach.
* Like most others, I began with vertical spreads thinking they were safer and while they're safer from large losses, they're not really safe in terms of expected return. It's very difficult to make money trading these long-term.
* I found pivoting to a handful of strategies to work by far the best:
   * Covered Strangle
   * Ratio Diagonals
   * Straddles / Strangles
* These strategies are still my primaries today.
* I didn't focus on maximizing my returns - I couldn't accept that volatility as I knew I was responsible for my mother. So I focused on repeatable returns with lower return variance. I've found this to work well for my psyche but traders must find what aligns best with their own.

The punchline here is don't allow other people to dictate your potential. While it's absolutely essential to understand the landscape and probabilities of what we're trying to do, again, impossible is different than improbable. It goes without saying the VAST majority of traders would be LIGHTYEARS better off buying and holding - DCAing into an index ETF like SPY. Trading is NOT for hobbyists, that only leads to capital destruction. However, it is indeed possible."

0,"Screw it, let me use real numbers and my case.  
I make 48K right now and my one year review is in May. My market value will be 65K-70K (I am certified and depending on how I learn programming in the next 5-6 months).  
  
In my 6 months review, they told me the salary band for my role is between 48K start, 60K mid point and 72K top. Meaning, someone who doesn't learn programming or get certifications gets the mid point in one year in market value, and top point in 2 years.  
  
Bottom line, they count on people not researching their market value, not being aware about the incredible shortage in my field (12 recruiter emails in my first 6 months), not getting certified or learning programming.  
  
Role: CRM Administrator. First real job out of uni."

"I was doing some last minute DD before earnings. Datadog had been technically oversold since the last earnings. Lots of puts against it too going to earnings. Fundamentally it's performing well. Low debt, almost positive net income, decent cash flow, and high gross margins.

The price action is likely a result of a delayed short squeeze as most of the market rallied last week with dovish Powell while datadog and snowflake stayed at the same level.

With this earnings, they beat on eps, revenue, and improved guidance. Also net income is positive again which is also a plus.

As long as the market continues to believe that the Fed will no longer increase rates, we could see more momentum with these growth tech names. I would pay attention to snowflake earnings next. As soon as snowflake starts to decrease stock based compensation the price will probably continue to rise."
"> I opened a sell put on QQQ at $360 and a buy put at $359 with a 2 week expiration.

FWIW, it's good to learn standard notation for option positions. If nothing else, it's a reminder to include important details, like the opening credit/debit.

You can write the same position concisely as:

-1 QQQ 360/350p MM/DD @ $X.XX.

The MM/DD is the expiration and the $X.XX is the opening debit or credit in per-share dollars, both of which you left out of your original post. Those are essential facts that you should edit into the OP ASAP.

> The current price is $366 and coming down a little - why is the total return showing a loss if the current price is still above the two strikes??

How do you know it's showing a loss? How are we supposed to confirm that it's a loss when you don't tell us what $X.XX was at open and what it is now.

Just because your broker posts a red or green value for the trade doesn't necessarily mean that's what it is actually worth. Your broker is just *guessing*, based on the mark of the bid/ask spread. Explainer here: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/wiki/faq/pages/mondayschool/yourorders/

> If the stock price stays above the 2 strikes I should be fine correct?

No, not at all.

It's hard to tell exactly where your misconception lies, and it's possible you have more than one, but I'll guess that you are confusing the **expiration** characteristics of a spread with the pre-expiration market. They are not the same thing. Assertions you can make about expiration pricing don't usually apply before expiration.

Where the stock price is vs. your strike price is most relevant at expiration, less so before expiration. It's not completely irrelevant, but just because QQQ is above your strikes doesn't mean you can't lose money.

In general, a declining market is bad for a trade that shorts puts. A short put is a bullish play, so a bear market should reduce the value of a bullish play. A put buyer gains value when QQQ declines, and what's good for a buyer is bad for a seller and you are a put seller."

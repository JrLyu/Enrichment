"Americans are having issues paying their credit card loans in record numbers! Credit cards have huge interest rates and fees. This is especially worrying since the same interest rates and fees were increased in the last year or two to record numbers. 

What is the best way to get exposure and potentially great profits in this situation? I know banks are lending the money, but they are also the collateral, so they are a bad exposure and I am already exposed enough in banks (GS/JPM). I am wondering who is profiting the most from delayer c.c. payments. I suppose some debt collection agencies? 

Banks are at risk also due to the lowering prices of houses and the reduction of purchases in the housing market, so I am wondering which publicly traded companies earn the most from delayer payments and defaults basically."

"Ok, hear me out: what if T Swift releases a concert film *every* quarter?"
"I'm using SGOV as my savings account, and the only disadvantages I've encountered so far are:

1. Be careful of settlement times. SGOV is T+2, while money market mutual funds are T+1. So don't sell SGOV and use the proceeds to buy SNSXX on the same day.

2. Wash sales can happen. Realistically, it won't cost you much if you're not selling often. But if you're trading SGOV across multiple accounts, you're technically supposed to keep track of your wash sales by hand, which would be a pain. 

3. Dividends take an extra week past their ex-date to land, and then DRIP takes another day to buy. Again, not a huge cost."
"Treasury Bills might get a higher return, unless you have a CD with a comparable rate.
If it’s in a retirement account and you’re not touching the funds during the CD term, then I guess being locked into a CD isn’t a concern.

The other downside is opportunity cost: if you come across another investment that could generate more returns, but you’re stuck with the option you chose. For example, if interest or T-Bill rates went up even higher but you’re stuck in the CD."
"What you describe sounds more like T&C for -options-, not outright grants.

Or are you really talking about a case where an employee might say, ""Thanks but no thanks, I don't want this stock at $10 'cuz I think it might go to $8?""  If that's the case, then maybe you should simply sell your shares ASAP as soon as they vest, rather than keep them for appreciation?"
Pretty common already. Xfinity gives me free Netflix and HBO and my T-Mobile plan gives me free Hulu.
"Not sure why you take the time to do this study, if you unpack the solution to BSM (delta is one term of the PDE) you can get the probability of ITM given BSM's assumptions. (hint: Delta is not probability of ITM, and the probability of ITM as computed by BSM is also wrong, because it assumes a gaussian distribution of returns)  


Start here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks\_(finance)#Formulae\_for\_European\_option\_Greeks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greeks_(finance)#Formulae_for_European_option_Greeks)

From the second term in the solution, you can clearly see it's the expected present value of the strike, and if you know what expected value is you would know that the probability that S > K is N(d2), where N is the standard normal cumulative distribution function.

N(d2) = (ln(S/K) + (r - q + 0.5 \* σ\^2) \* T) / (σ \* √T)

That is the BSM probability that your option finishes ITM. 

If you really want to have fun, now you can say if the option is trading at fair value, what does that imply about the inputs to BSM? Turns out there is only one free parameter - volatility. Do you agree with the implied vol? Why or why not? That might get you to a place where you understand if options should be sold/bought"

"Wow is this question a tough one. Margin call rate? You mean margin rate? Interest rate? You pay 8% on borrowed money. T bills make about 5.4%. How can you possibly make money? You’ll lose big time! Besides, you cannot buy T bills on Robinhood. Your question is very confusing. Care to elaborate on your thought process here?"

You need to call the transfer agent for AT &T stock. Call or email their investor relations contact ( you’ll find this on their website) and you can easily get the right contact info for this. A broker can’t do this for you; you must call or email yourself.
"If it's just a few, you can look them up in old newspapers.

NY times has old newspapers online. I think you need to be a subscriber. So either that, or go to a library.

If it's just a handful, post them here and I'll look them up.

Once you find the prices, you'll need to figure out any splits since then. That might be more complicated. VZ split out of T and then combined with some others. It's a mess."

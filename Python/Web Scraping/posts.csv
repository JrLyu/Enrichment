Throughout a period of sky-high interest rates, depleted savings and grinding inflation, Americans have spent with abandon.

On Black Friday, sales at brick-and-mortar stores were up 1.1% from last year; online alone, US shoppers spent a record $9.8bn (¬£7.72bn) online alone. Consumers spent another $12.4bn (¬£9.77bn) on Cyber Monday ‚Äì an eye-popping 9.6% increase over last year. This holiday splurge follows a pattern of US consumer spending, which has buoyed the American economy in the past year, making up nearly 70% of the real GDP's 4.9% Q3 growth.",1701475816.0

Not to mention millions in  fines and merger costs paid for by the SPAC kitty. And founders issued  themselves millions of shares at pennies apiece - so they cash in even  if the stock drops precipitously. Plus Truth Social is circling the  drain (few users, no money, plenty of debt).

There's a decent chance I think the SEC calls the whole thing off because they didn't even try to hide the grift.

If it goes through, it seems like you could just buy long puts right after the merger and walk away rich.

I agree with having an Adult in the room because they can't afford another fiasco or it's going to look bad on the entire AI hype-machine.

"Duck, duck, $GOOS!",30,1881ma6,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1881ma6/duck_duck_goos/,16,"If some of you are out of long ideas on specific companies, I found a diamond in the rough you might like. It's Canada Goose, ticker $GOOS. First, yes it has high short interest (35% of float), but the short ratio is not squeeze worthy. Second, debt service doesn't seem great, and to make it worse, they recently announced the [acquisition of a supplier](https://investor.canadagoose.com/news/news-details/2023/Canada-Goose-Acquires-First-European-Manufacturing-Facility/default.aspx), which may increase leverage short term. That's not all, they are buying back shares despite low FCF conversion. This all looks meh on the surface if we assume the worst.

The long time [CEO](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/10/how-canada-goose-ceo-built-outerwear-store-into-billion-dollar-company.html) is a grandson of the founder and owns 10% of the company. He grew the business from $2.2 million in revenue when he took over in 1997 to $1.3 billion today (that's right, million with an M to billion with a B). So I'm inclined to excuse the levered to the tits pace at which he operates.

Luckily they're growing faster ([11%](https://www.financecharts.com/stocks/GOOS/summary/revenue-ttm-cagr)) than their growing industry ([7%](https://www.google.com/search?q=luxury+winter+outerwear+industry+size&sca_esv=586734894&sxsrf=AM9HkKk-MUVF3YbhYhSRCPi46NJNsXZR5w%3A1701394826015&ei=ijlpZdw_wLHQ8Q__95CoBw&ved=0ahUKEwjcrOjRje2CAxXAGDQIHf87BHUQ4dUDCBA&uact=5&oq=luxury+winter+outerwear+industry+size&gs_lp=Egxnd3Mtd2l6LXNlcnAiJWx1eHVyeSB3aW50ZXIgb3V0ZXJ3ZWFyIGluZHVzdHJ5IHNpemUyCBAhGKABGMMEMggQIRigARjDBDIIECEYoAEYwwRIxB5Qsw9YzhhwAXgBkAEAmAG2AaABlAaqAQMzLjS4AQPIAQD4AQHCAgoQABhHGNYEGLADwgIHECMYsAIYJ8ICChAhGKABGMMEGAriAwQYACBBiAYBkAYI&sclient=gws-wiz-serp)). That means increasing market share in an industry that grows with world population trends (recession defensive or GDP+). They are not screwing shareholders to accomplish this growth either. Their gross margins continue to be over 70%. They produce positive Free Cash Flow that is [greater](https://investor.canadagoose.com/financials/sec-filings/default.aspx) than Share Based Compensation. They are buying back shares and have reduced overall share count almost 10% since they went public in 2017. Plus they just authorized another 10% of the shares outstanding to be repurchased (20% of float). Insiders are also buying. The leverage is concerning, but the aggressive growth is good in the long term. More on this in a bit.

The shares set an all time high of $72.27 in 2019, but trade at $11 today despite a bigger and better business. Sentiment is really poor because COVID pushed the luxury winter outerwear refresh cycle back a couple years. Unlike regular parkas, these last several years. So less wear and tear on because more people were indoors, especially affluent stay-at-home workers, means the parkas lasted longer than usual. Then last year they had a revenue decline partially due to supply chain (China) issues. So to most investors it looked not only like a COVID ""over-earner"" but also a fad luxury brand that faded. The parka refresh cycle is back this year. Google trends indicates higher organic search volume in the last week of November than last year:

&#x200B;

Canada Goose is not simply a luxury trend brand that go in and out of style like [Moncler](https://www.meurice.nyc/journal/2018/11/5/moncler-vs-canadagoose). It is more utilitarian like Ferrari or Rolex. It fits an extreme use case that connects users to an experiential and addictive lifestyle that sets them apart from the average loser. Management understands this and is capitalizing on it by making that image more accessible. Now they sell winter accessories, boots, and even light winter wear (global warming hedge?). All of these items functionally set themselves apart in their categories and command the same 70%+ gross margin from consumers.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/jpf1slmlnl3c1.png?width=1126&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7a1080a858f78ade99c425401c0450824e36617

&#x200B;

So the aggressive drive to increase marketshare at a break neck pace exposes Canada Goose's quality and usefulness to new customers while they experience the lifestyle it enables, thereby building high-margin repeat business with them in the future. This justifies management's strategy despite it not sitting well with investors in this high rate environment--one that is [about to change](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/bill-ackman-bets-fed-cut-231248854.html) in the company's favor.

I figured out the stock market?,0,188pakc,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/188pakc/i_figured_out_the_stock_market/,24,"Okay so I just had a thought. Is the reason why something like the S&P500 (or whatever) keeps growing (S&P has something like avg +10%/year right?) because more people keep investing in it?

Lets say investors lose all faith in apple and the stock crashes. The S&P probably wont dip too much because those investors just put their money in another company which takes its place on the S&P.

Hence why the S&P is such a 'safe bet'. Only problem is ofc if investors withdraw their money outright (and buy gold, real estate, savings account etc). So as long as they come back to the S&P sometime you can just hold your S&P positions and weather dips and financial crisis' and stuff.

And why the S&P or stockarket as a whole keeps growing is because they just attract more investors/money. Average 10% per year to be precise. From more people who start investing (because they learn about investing and/or because the general population keeps increasing) and people who just invest more.

So as long as the idea of 'the stock market' and trust in the S&P doesnt fade away but keeps increasing they are pretty good long-term bets?!

Did I figure out the stock market or am I regarded and worthy of this sub?

Edit: okay thanks for the comments so far! I see how some points I raised are faulty and perhaps plain regarded if you think about the fundamentals of the stock market for more than 5 mins. Still, the S&P does seem like a pretty safe long-term investment which kinda just keeps growing as long as it doesnt crumble completely?",1701472315.0

Santa chuckled, his belly shaking like a bowl full of jelly. ""Indeed, Elvina! It seems the market is feeling the festive cheer. Maybe this year, I'll deliver returns instead of toys!""

What's the verdict on DELL's earnings tonight guys?,18,187nl2x,wallstreetbets,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/187nl2x/whats_the_verdict_on_dells_earnings_tonight_guys/,35,"I keep this one short. Dell Technologies Inc. (DELL) is projected to release financial results for its fiscal 2024 third quarter, today after the closing bell. Analysts expect the company to post quarterly earnings at $1.46 per share, down from year-ago earnings of $2.30 per share. The company‚Äôs revenue might come in the range of $22.5-$23.5 billion for the latest quarter, this is also a decrease from the year prior. However, according to seeking alpha, DELL has beaten EPS estimates 100% of the time over the last 2 years and has beaten revenue estimates 88% of the time. Over the last 3 months, EPS estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 3 downward. Revenue estimates have seen 12 upward revisions and 0 downward.

Dell expects both Client Solutions Group (CSG) and Infrastructure Solutions Group revenues to be roughly flat sequentially in the to-be-reported quarter. Continued sluggish IT spending by corporate and global enterprise customers is expected to have hurt top-line growth.

But wait, there's more. Dell's also getting smacked around by some nasty currency exchange rates. They're expecting a slight hit on their revenues because of this. Ouch.

But now, let's talk PCs. Demand's kinda meh right now. Gartner's spitting out some numbers saying worldwide PC shipments dipped 9% year-over-year in Q3 2023, down to about 64.279 million units. Dell's sitting in the third spot in the PC market race, behind Lenovo and HP, but hey, at least they're ahead of Apple.

This company shipped 10.32 million units, witnessing a 14.2% year-over-year decline in the third quarter of 2023, per the Gartner report. Just for comparison: Lenovo, HP and Apple shipped 16.146 million, 13.531 million and 6.266 million units, respectively.

Keep in mind, DELL is expected to benefit from the generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) boom as big tech increasingly invests in it. Dell's getting a piece of that sweet AI pie, diving headfirst into this generative AI craze. Dell‚Äôs expanding Generative AI solutions portfolio is expected to have accelerated top-line growth. They've got this thing called Dell Validated Design for Generative AI with NVIDIA, it offers pre-trained models that extract intelligence from data, sparing enterprises from building models from scratch.

Dell Validated Designs for Generative AI now supports both model tuning and inferencing. The solution is supported by the Dell PowerEdge XE9680 AI server or the Dell PowerEdge XE8640, with a choice of NVIDIA Tensor Core GPUs and NVIDIA AI Enterprise software, which offers frameworks, pre-trained models and development tools, such as the NVIDIA NeMo framework and Dell software.

I'm going to grab calls, because I'm expecting a turn-around in sales and them to beat expectations once again. I gotta remind you guys for those who missed out last quarter, DELL went up well over 15% with earnings. It went up the earnings prior too and the one before that. What's also great is that the cons are cheap due to lower strike prices. So I'm going to grab 12/1 77c @ 1.80. We just need the stock to go up ~4.6% to break even here. Be mindful of the bid/ask spread tho, since this is a lower-volume contract. 75 and 76c boasts higher volume, but are a bit more expensive. To make things even cheaper, you can consider a put spread. Regardless, just like my other posts: this isn't financial advice. I'd like to just show people the type of stuff we tend to look at when trying to attempt an earning play. This hopefully will help you with future earning plays too. Next week, we have NIO, AI, and CHWY. And don't forget, Gamestop!",1701364250.0

I'm Irakli Guntaishvili, a Product Owner at 3Commas. As one of the leading cryptocurrency trade automation platforms, we're excited to introduce our latest innovation: the Signal Bot (beta). Signal Bot makes it easier to create a killer bot that can do more than just Grid or DCA strategies by simplifying the incorporation of TradingView alerts and signals directly into the bot. It receives alerts from TradingView and opens positions, offering users the ability to manage these positions by increasing or decreasing them as needed.

I'm here to address any inquiries you may have about automating crypto trading strategies, ranging from simple to complex, using signals from market intelligence platforms like TradingView. While my primary focus is on TradingView users, given that our latest bot, the Signal Bot, is tailored to their needs, I believe this conversation will be intriguing for anyone, including those who are not currently using TradingView or automated bot trading. It might serve as inspiration for you to explore these avenues further.

Signal Bot is primarily targeted at experienced crypto traders, but if you‚Äôre already using TradingView for your stock trading moves or for crypto market intelligence, you might find the transition to trading crypto with Signal Bot to not be the big leap it is for others. 

**What is 3Commas?** 

3Commas is a software platform that allows traders to automate their strategies at scale by using bots and other tools. Basically, our bots do all the chartwatching and buy/sell actions for you according to the conditions and parameters you decide. Our multi-pair bots can watch 200 coin pairs at the same time, hunting for deals that meet your conditions, with assistance from signals and indicators either set up by you or delivered via a trusted 3rd party such as TradingView. 

Between Signal Bot, DCA Bot, Grid Bot, and Smart Trade, almost any trading strategy you can dream up, including extremely complex maneuvers, can be executed with 3Commas trade facilitation tools. 

We are not a brokerage, and we do not have custody of client funds at any time. Our software works by creating an encrypted API connection between your 3Commas account and your account on cryptocurrency exchanges such as Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, OKX, etc. and sending commands to execute actions allowed by those exchanges.

"(Canada) I have the amounts/dates of every crypto purchase I've made, haven't bought any in a year.

I never traded pairs, always bought the crypto, moved it straight to my current cold wallet and it's been there for over a year.   


I'm just curious, I'm eventually going to send chunks at a time of it to an exchange and sell in %s as price goes up. I'm just not sure how to calculate the gains. Like I would understand let's say I bought 2k BTC overall, it's now worth 5k. If I sell it all, 3k gain, waited a year so it's classified long term gains so 50% taxable, and then my income bracket would make it a 15% of 1500 so 225?   


But if I sell in parts it gets very complicated no? What BTC am I selling, which of those purchases? Cus I bought at various price points, how do I know if this 100$ of BTC is from the 16k etc lows or if it was when I bought some at 23k? I'm assuming there's apps and stuff or something to track my wallet and see where everything came from and when. I'm tech savvy enough, but as far as finances and taxes go I'd just like an ELI5 version. As of right now I just bought, stored, and there's no taxable events to factor in.

Will Bitcoin ETFs and improved user experience really drive crypto adoption?,3,188d7am,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/188d7am/will_bitcoin_etfs_and_improved_user_experience/,59,"The world of cryptocurrencies is evolving at a rapid pace, with new developments and innovations emerging every day. One of the most talked-about topics in the crypto space is the potential impact of Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs) and improvements in user experience on the adoption of cryptocurrencies

Bitcoin ETFs are expected to drive institutional adoption of cryptocurrencies. The approval of Bitcoin spot ETFs is anticipated to bring a measure of institutional confidence and a significant amount of funding to the cryptocurrency space. The belief is that the approval of several ETFs is not a matter of if, but when. This could potentially lead to a surge in institutional investment in the sector.

On the other hand, some believe that Bitcoin ETFs are just ‚Äúwatered-down crypto‚Äù and a sign the industry is heading in the wrong direction. They argue that the success of the crypto space comes from helping people self-custody assets and decouple from the traditional finance system. If crypto adoption happens mostly through ETFs and similar centralized financial instruments, then the core promises of the technology won‚Äôt be realized.

Improvements in user experience are also seen as a key driver for crypto adoption. The argument is that setting up a wallet for safe self-custody is still a daunting task for many non-tech-savvy institutional and retail investors. An ETF will improve market access and will help further democratize Bitcoin.

So, what are your thoughts? Do you believe that Bitcoin ETFs are a game-changer for institutional investors? Can enhancing user experience on crypto platforms significantly increase adoption among casual investors and the general public? Or are there other, more critical factors at play in driving cryptocurrency adoption?",1701440925.0
Watch out for the open source label. Sometimes it isn't true,17,1884mll,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1884mll/watch_out_for_the_open_source_label_sometimes_it/,14,"So something I am seeing more and more popular is hardware wallets saying they are open source when they currently aren't. In many cases, they will say they are planning on becoming open source. But there is no hard date on this, nothing showing if it will really become open source, and nothing to help for if they lied.   


The 2 examples I will give doesn't mean these are bad companies or it will never become open source. It's just, most would expect if a product says they are open source..... That it is actually open sourced. 

The following is from Yodel\_And\_Hodl\_Mode, or at least they pointed it out to me.

In short the Ledger box is saying it is open source. Still today, it isn't open source. 

There was a lot of huff after Ledger brought in the recovery feature. This making their hardware wallet from a cold wallet into a hot wallet. And note they mentioned they will make it open source so we can verify them. But still today they never did. Instead they ended up banning users on reddit who spoke up and asked questions. 

&#x200B;

The next I don't think they are scamming. I think it's just a company that pushed out a product way too quickly since their new hardware wallet doesn't have many of the coins as the previous version. And they have an expected date of next month after the audit. It's Keystone.

Additionally, the Chairman of the SEC Gary Gensler back in 2018 stated that Bitcoin, Ether, Litecoin, and Bitcoin Cash are ‚Äúnot securities.‚Äù This seems to be the most blatant piece of evidence these two will be the next up. If I had one last piece of reasoning it would be that both Bitcoin Cash (BCH) and Litecoin (LTC) were forked off of Bitcoin.

More than three-quarters of all blockchain games launched in the last five years are dead in the water, according to a recent study from CoinGecko. Out of 2,817 games launched between 2018 and 2023, which were included in the study, only 690 of them still have a somewhat active player base.

They define a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù Web3 game as one where the 14-day moving average number of active users drops 99% or more from its peak.

While 2021 saw the highest number of blockchain games launched in a single year with 738 games, the following year ‚Äî marred by major crypto collapses, saw the highest number of games to fizzle out, with 742 failing in a single year.

This puts the average failure rate of Web3 games at around 80% for any given year since 2018. 

Also noted that years of lower failure tended to coincide with the back of bull markets, while higher failure years came toward the start of bear market cycles.

CryptoKitties was one of the first Web3 games that gathered hype in late 2017, but its adoption has since fizzled out. Decentraland, The Sandbox and Axie Infinity are among other Web3 games that have launched in the earlier years and are still widely used today. Per recent data, Alien Worlds, Splinterlands and Planet IX had the three highest average unique active wallets used between Jan. 1 and Apr. 22, 2023.

While 2022 had the highest number of failed games, 2023 has slowed the trend, with only 507 failed projects as of Nov. 27.",1701356081.0

This discussion thread has much higher standards compared to the Daily Discussion thread. Please behave in accordance with the following rules.

 1. All [r/CC rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/about/rules) apply.

 2. For top-level comments, a minimum of 250 characters will be imposed as well as a minimum of 1000 comment karma and 6 months account age.

 3. Discussions must be on topic, ie positive but not to the point of being absurd or utopian. Statements should be substantiated with sound reason and/or evidence.

Also, discussions about market analysis, financial advice, or tech support will most likely be removed and is better suited for the daily thread. 

 4. Low-effort comments promoting coins or tokens will be removed. For example, comments saying ‚ÄúBuy coin X!‚Äù or ‚ÄúCoin X is going to the moon!üöÄ‚Äù, showcasing the current composition of your portfolio, or stating you sold coin X for coin Y, will be removed. In other words, no shilling. 

 5. Offensive language, profanity, trolling, and satire will be removed. This thread is intended for **mature** discussion.

The game aims to teach people about the scammers and their scams, as well as give us in the space a chance to beat those ass-hats up.

I've laid out some basics, but would love some help brainstorming ideas and scenarios.

&#x200B;

Here are the scammers I have in mind:

* **FTX** / Sam bankman fried
* **Block one** / Brendan Blumer & Dan Larimer
* **Pixelmon** /  Hamiltonian Martin Van Blerk
* **Bitconnect** / Satish Kumbhani

&#x200B;

For the player character:

* Name: **Jake**
* Age: **23**
* Aesthetic: **Backwards hat, beard, t-shirt, khaki pants, loafers**
* Special attack: **Throw money on the floor (baits enemies)**

&#x200B;

Minions:

* Phishing hooks - Hooks that come from the top of the screen and try to grab you
* Rug pullers - Enemies that try to hit you with rugs
* ???

&#x200B;

**I'm not sure what to do about the locations yet either.** Would love some suggestions. Maybe a crypto conference for one.

&#x200B;

Any other ideas you have are more than welcome, thanks!

Retro Games On Blockchain,0,18893ht,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/18893ht/retro_games_on_blockchain/,5," During ETHGlobal Istanbul hackathon, the Cartesi team showcased their World Arcade live during the event. Cartesi is an Application-Specific Rollup with a custom RISC-V-based virtual machine. It can be deployed as a L2,L3 or a Sovereign Rollup while enjoying unprecedented levels of computational scalability. Their World Arcade enables you play retro games such as Antcopter, Snake, and DOOM on the Cartesi Machine. The big deal now is you don't have to go to any event to have a feel of the World Arcade, it can now be played directly from your browser! I am a fan of having these games on the blockchain because it definitely brings about a sense of nostalgia.

Game moves are submitted onchain so the session will be replayed a Cartesi Rollups to generate a verifiable score. Everytime you play, your session is saved on the blockchain and can show off your high score. There's also the liberty of uploading your own games as well. Which blockchain games are you guys trying out these days? There's so much fun to be had!

Let me start off by saying that I k it I should not take advice from strangers on Reddit. However, I feel a brotherly bond with you all (well, that & everyone I know IRL pretty much hate crypto & are no help) lol

I have 2k to blow. I‚Äôm looking to gamble or & throw it into a low cap coin that is available on Coinbase. I want it to be under a $20 million market cap. 

I‚Äôm going to list off the potential coins. If you could be so kind & just give me your advice on which one to go with, I will be forever grateful. If I become rich, you‚Äôre all invited to my mansion pool party. I don‚Äôt own the mansion yet, but I will once this coin makes me rich.

Being that the coins I am going to name are all low market cap coins, they will be considered shit coins. I know I‚Äôm stupid & wasting my money, but I have been in crypto currency‚Äôs long enough to know the basics. I‚Äôm content with my portfolio, so this is strictly a gamble play.

These are the coins, and what I know about them for far:



SWFTC ($5 million MC)

This is the lowest MC coin on Coinbase (I believe)., which is one of the reasons why it made the list.

SWFTC is the utility token for a decentralized cross chain platform. SWFT Blockchain currently has over 300 coins on their platform. With SWFTC, the user gets 50% off of transaction fees when using the platform. This coin/platform was developed in I believe 2015. It has a pretty impressive average daily volume for its MC (24hr volume average is about $1.5 million). The SWFT Blockchain platform seems pretty active on social media, and they are always listing new coins onto the platform. Seems like a weekly thing.

https://www.swft.pro




CTX ($10 million MC)

CTX is the governance token for Cryptex Finance, which is a decentralized platform that lets you trade against the entire crypto market cap. You can long/short the entire crypto market cap with up to 20x leverage. It is a DAO, and CTX gives you voting rights for the platform. CTX has a small supply (10 million total coin supply)

https://cryptex.finance




INV ($17.5 million MC)

Inverse Finance is a lending protocol. Holding INV gives certain incentives for using the ecosystem. This one has more competition as it is DeFi lending, but the tech seems good & the platform seems reliable. One of the things I like about this one is that it has an extremely low total supply (480k), so if this one gains any traction, the price is going to sky rocket. 

https://www.inverse.finance



These are the 3 coins I‚Äôm debating between. If you can give me any feedback and/or your recommendation, I would definitely appreciate it!

Also, if you have any recommendations on any coins, please let me know! All I ask is that it is available on Coinbase. Coinbase vets their listed coins thoroughly, so it helps eliminate any potential frauds/scams.



Thanks for hearing me out, I definitely appreciate you all!! Good luck on your investments, and may the bull run commence!",1701437766.0

I used to play the stock valuation numbers game. I had the good old days of cash flow projections. Still have my trusty model (Excel), but now it's more of a toy than a tool. That's the problem: crypto has no cash flow.

My question here is straightforward: Is crypto pricing just riding the hype train, or is there more to it than meets the eye? Also, what's up with 'undervalued' tokens? What should we look at?

Toying with the idea of assessing metrics from 'undervalued' gems mentioned on Twitter (I'll start with DeFi) and then analyzing them.

I want to gather data on P/E ratios, active addresses, fees, growth rates, gas costs, and yields. Also, I need the historical token prices and the annualized protocol revenue. I'm using customized Oracles from Pyth (they have a tutorial channel on YT) and Dia (they have an Oracle builder tool) for some of the data, but I don't have it all yet. I'm sure Python can get the job done with some custom APIs, but it's going to be a big adventure to get all of the data.

$50 Weekly Investment,141,18745vo,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/18745vo/50_weekly_investment/,118,"Hello all,

I decided to stop throwing money in a video poker machine once a week which is usually around $40-$60 and instead started buying $25 of XRP and $25 of Bitcoin every Monday. I'm doing this to stop myself from putting money in a video poker machine because I know in the long run I'll end up losing gambling. I could very well end up losing in this $50 a week strategy as well but this way I get to scratch the itch of gambling and it could work out well in the long run unlike the inevability of losing it gambling on a dumb poker machine or sports.

I make enough to save $500 every week when I get a paycheck and was wondering if this strategy is dumb or if someone else is doing something similar.

Would you stick with Bitcoin and XRP?",1701302515.0

TOP Centralized Exchanges Tokens by Market Cap,19,187erpt,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/187erpt/top_centralized_exchanges_tokens_by_market_cap/,21,"What do you think about the CEX coins and tokens?

 I think that there is a very high probability that the wave of newcomers during a bull run and increased demand for cryptocurrencies are going to dramatically increase the popularity of CEXs and their native coins. Relatively small exchange coins might be good to invest in and expect to make significant gains. For example, on the Bull Run of 2021, BNB showed an increase from 41$ to 683$, and the Huobi token went from 5$ to 39$. If we don't see another FTX case, then CEX coins are quite a good option for people who are okay with taking such an amount of risk.

Why You Should Never Store a Cryptocurrency Seed Phrase In Plain Text,196,186xzhg,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/186xzhg/why_you_should_never_store_a_cryptocurrency_seed/,177,"I wrote a small [educational demo](https://github.com/chaintuts/seedscanner) in Python. [This tool](https://imgur.com/a/Hrx9ux6)  demonstrates just how easy it is to scan for plain text seeds (in other words, seeds that aren't encrypted). My demo is a small library and UI for testing out and showing this concept, and can also be combined with [code](https://github.com/chaintuts/phishyserver) that would, for example, exfiltrate stolen seeds and store them in an attacker's database. Scanning for the seed is fairly simple - using regular expressions (a common programming tool) to search files on disk. Obviously, don't use the seeds shown in this demo as anyone could steal your coins.

Real malware exists that can execute these sorts of attacks, or other attacks like [clipboard hijacking](https://github.com/chaintuts/addrjack). 
Attackers have also compromised weak passphrases on encrypted password managers, such as those exposed in the LastPass vault breach.

What should you do instead? 

* If it's a hardware wallet seed only store the seed on paper or metal. The whole purpose of an offline wallet is to keep the keys away from general purpose devices like phones or PCs, even in encrypted form
* If it's a software wallet seed, you can store the seed in an encrypted form in software such as an encrypted password manager. However, you MUST ensure that the passphrase protecting that encrypted key store is strong, and only for smaller amounts of money. (again, see the LastPass vault breach).
* Don't ever store the seed on a PC or phone in a plain text (unencrypted) format, period.",1701286514.0

Objectively what I mean by ""best"" is that the exchange lets you trade from one crypto currency to another for minimal fees.

Here is ones I have heard are quite good / reputable in the UK right now:

Crypto.com exchange  
Kraken  
Coinbase (bigger fees is that correct?)

Wondering if this is Justin's way of securing the required Dogelon Mars token while simultaneously taking over the project.

Or, it could be some Dogelon Mars supporters needed working capital to finish their much talked about Rufus chain coming possibly sometime in 2024.

New Tokenomics? Is that even allowed?!,21,186zd6a,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/186zd6a/new_tokenomics_is_that_even_allowed/,70,"I always assumed that tokenomics are set in stone.  I clearly was wrong on that.

My first time seeing they can and do change tokenomics was with a project called Lukso.  It didn't make sense to me how that would be done, but didn't dig much further as I was going to see how things were looking after mainnet was running for a while.  All I really know is that it was implemented and here is some detail from an article I found searching lukso tokenomics:  


""**We know for certain that there are about 15 million coins in the current circulating supply‚Ä¶ and another about 18 million were unlocked when Mainnet launched on May 23 2023**

**We know that originally there were 100 million proposed as a hard cap, but The Genesis Validators that started the network have chosen to launch the Mainnet with only 42 million LYX. LUKSO also implemented EIP-1559 (meaning some part of each transaction fee will get burned) so the supply could (in theory) become deflationary, similar to Ethereum.""**  


So, that is a bit fascinating that the validators chose how to start it up, but I know it was proposed from the founders.  


The next that I encountered is with Qanplatform.  This team is preparing to reduce token supply nearly 30% ahead of mainnent.  


This simply involves a team decision to burn supply from team and project wallets- which is an approach that doesn't depend on validators when starting the network.    You can find details by searching Qanx token burn. The announcement says:  


"" **Subsequent calculations and analysis led to the conclusion that this surplus of tokens is not essential for the successful execution of the project, but on the other hand it would result in an unfair voting power at the upcoming mainnet launch which goes against core decentralization principles. ""**  


I do own that one, so I started to wonder if this is out of the ordinary.  If you google things like ""Changing tokenomics"" , ""Updated tokenomics"", etc you start to come across quite a lot names you'll likely know:

ATOM  POLYGON MPL  dYdX   Sushiswap ...  


They all have a variety of reasons for the changes, but it definitely seems to be a common practice to achieve the project goals.  

In your experience, have the changes to tokenomics you've encountered been a good move?  Tell us why or why not.  Cheers",1701290159.0

Web3 Can Become the Future of Advertising With Privacy in Place,0,187gk76,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/187gk76/web3_can_become_the_future_of_advertising_with/,3,"There is no doubt digital marketing is integral to web2 or as we know it the modern traditional internet. Can web3 or the decentralized internet have a part to play in redefining the scope and potential of advertising? Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong seems to think so as he recently [suggested](https://www.coinbase.com/blog/request-for-builders-startups-i-would-build-today) that web3 could possibly take web2's CPC model (only pay if someone clicks the ad) to the next level of CPA (only pay when someone buys or takes an action on-chain).

The targeted advertising model is the popular way to go in digital marketing, and we all know that the violation of personal privacy that often comes with the territory is a big pain point. Not only the users have nothing to gain but everything to lose (like privacy due to lack of data sovereignty) but they also have no part in sharing the value of an industry that is in excess of $15b. A privacy-oriented web3 that offers data confidentiality and security can lead to a new era of digital marketing with on-chain ads.

Oasis Network is a layer-1 blockchain with a modular architecture that supports confidential runtimes in both WASM ([Cipher](https://docs.oasis.io/dapp/cipher/)) and EVM ([Sapphire](https://oasisprotocol.org/sapphire)) building environments. So, building a responsible data economy for web3 where data tokenization happens while keeping user data sovereignty as a priority is not just the future, it is already possible.

Without getting into technicalities, suffice it to say that Oasis brings selective privacy features that manage end users' sensitive personal information giving them access control of what they want to share, when they want to share, with whom they want to share, and how much they want to share. 

A natural progression of data ownership and tokenization is monetizing the data and deriving the rewards of the data economy instead of marketing conglomerates hogging the profits of data harvesting. Programmable confidentiality and tokenized data tools on Oasis can help with this opportunity where profit and privacy go hand in hand.

There is no doubt the idea of crypto-native marketing is still nascent and will have its own set of challenges and opportunities. Oasis, with its smart privacy technologies, is ideally suited to take the idea forward so that [on-chain advertising](https://oasisprotocol.org/blog/better-privacy-for-onchain-ads) can take off in the right direction.

What do you think about the scope and potential of privacy-assured on-chain ads and its merit as one of the top 10 ideas for crypto builders to focus on?",1701344288.0
"After ""hacks"" and withdrawal halts, prices on HTX and Poloniex are still decoupled from the rest of the market.",10,1871iut,CryptoCurrency,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1871iut/after_hacks_and_withdrawal_halts_prices_on_htx/,10,"#What does decoupled mean?

Normally through arbitrage bots prices tend to be harmonized between exchanges. If a decoupling event takes place it means arbitrage bots for whatever reason can not do their work and the price decouples. If the problem is not severe or can be fixed in a timely manner, the bots can start their work again and equalize prices between all exchanges - resulting in ""the market price"".

Now, what we see on HTX and Poloniex since their claimed ""hacks"" is that a decoupling took place, but prices haven't returned back to normal for days or weeks.

A concrete show case: https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/monero/ (""sort by volume""). Or see it here: https://i.imgur.com/XWe1SJ1.png

Despite claiming to have the largest daily XMRUSDT trading volume of all CEX the price is ~$2 cheaper on HTX than on all other exchanges with the exception of Poloniex.

Together with Poloniex they claim to have 33% of daily (wash trading) volume of Monero. But then you look at the order books and you see it stacked with ridiculous low amounts of (paper) coins on a day that not even sees a +2%/-2% movement.

Now we have plenty of data to compare (healthy) exchanges with troubled ones. We know that volume, price and number of real coins held by an exchange are connected and can be represented through each other. If something is off it is easily recognizable like in this case. Something doesn't add up. Prices should follow liquidity. But if like supposed their is no real liquidty but wash trading with paper coins to attract new deposits it's a severe red flag you should know about.

But the defi space also seems to also be developing very slowly.  Granted, this is coming from someone who hasn't really been paying close attention.  But what are the options?  Thor Swap is still in beta for lending, so that doesn't sound great.  So, I guess the question is:  What the most developed, tested, user-friendly, overall solid platform out there for this?

They will create a digital token version of any asset there is, BTC included and that will be the future of finance. ETFs is a gateway to that future. They are not hiding that fact. You just have to listen to what they are saying. Look up Blackrock CEOs comments about blockchain or the latest interest in tokenizing assets, like the 11 trillion investment fund is planning to do in UK. 

Another important thing to understand is that the value of underlying commodity at any given time does not matter. Its about tokenizing that asset and creating a product people are willing to trade. It does not matter if oil, gold, BTC or any company stock is $5 or $1500 dollars, investors will still buy and sell on regular basis, treating it as the real thing and banks or other financial institutions do not make money on the value of assets but on facilitation of the trading and management of those funds. They will keep control of the prices and you will just trade a virtual version of what ever you want to invest in using virtual tokenized version of cash like the CBDC. They will own all the real assets and all the real wealth and you will hold a computer version of something that feels like that assets and bet on where the price of that asset goes next.

The access to exchanges to trade and therefore directly influence price of actual asset will be taken away from people and we will go back to the way things were 100+ years ago. Only banks, dealers and authorized giants will trade real assets between themselves and industry leaders. Plebs will just trade funny tokens attached to what ever the elite is doing. That is why the boom and bust cycles has been created in all the markets from the very beginning. Its a way to transfer wealth on regular basis but its also a way to guarantee people will keep buying and selling and paying all the fees that come with it.",1701368426.0

Question on Covered Calls and Taxes,2,188hh1z,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/188hh1z/question_on_covered_calls_and_taxes/,11,"Question on covered call and taxes.

Hi all, US Tax Question. Would love some feedback. 

Let's assume I wrote ATM call option on a stock which I owned for more than a year, and just before expiration the option is deep in the money. 

Isn't it always better to buy back the option before expiry than letting it be assigned?

From a tax perspective, if I buy back the option I will record a tax loss on the option which will be around the difference between the underlying price and the strike. 

This loss will provide a short term tax shield. 
I can then sell the stock at current price, which will generate a long term capital gain. 

This seems better than holding to maturity, which would mean that the premium received when the option was sold would be taxed as short term gains and there will be smaller long term capital gain on the assigned asset.

Audience member:

There are a lot of startups, and not startups, doing AI chips optimized for LLMs, and they claim to be dramatically more effective and energy efficient than GPUs.  Can you talk about what you‚Äôre planning in this regard.

Jensen Huang, Nvidia CEO

""We realized Deep Learning/AI was not a chip problem, it‚Äôs a reinvention of computing problem.

Everything from how the computer works, how the software works, the type of software  it was going to write, the way that it‚Äôs written, the way we write it, the way we develop software today, using Ai, creating AI, that method is fundimentally different that the way we did it before.  So every aspect of computing is changed.

One of the things that‚Äôs people don‚Äôt realize is the vast majority of computing is a retrieval model.  You touch your phone, it retrieves a file and brings it back to you.In the future the vast majority computing is going to be retrieval plus generation.  The way computing is done is fundamentally changed.  We observed that about a decade and a half ago and people are still trying to sort that out.

People say we‚Äôre practically the only company doing it.  It‚Äôs probably because we‚Äôre the only company that got it.   And \[other\] people are still trying to get it.

You can‚Äôt solve this new way of computing by just designing a chip.  Every aspect of the computer has fundamentally changed.  Everything from the networking to the switching to the way the computer is designed to the chips themselves to the software that sits on top of it to the methodology that pulls it all together.

It's a big deal because it‚Äôs a compete reinvention of the computer industry.

And now we have a trillion dollars in data centers all over the world and all of that is going to get re-tooled.  That‚Äôs the amazing thing.  W‚Äôere in the the beginning of a brand new generation of computing.  It hasn‚Äôt been reinvented in 60 years.

This is why it‚Äôs such a big deal, it‚Äôs hard for people to wrap their head around it, but that was the great observation we made, it includes a chip, but it‚Äôs not just about that chip.""  source:  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkj-BLHs6dE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pkj-BLHs6dE)

1) Why would a company file bankruptcy when they have more assets than liabilities?

2) Based on the current proposed sale, what will I receive as a common stock holder?

This is really just an intellectual exercise.  I'm guessing if they did actually liquidate the company and split the proceeds amongst all shareholders, I'd be lucky to get $10.  But the cynic in me thinks that having this bankruptcy proceeding allows them to transfer the company to a new owner without any of the stockholders actually getting what the company is worth had they just sold everything and walked away!  However, readin ghte court documents doesn't seem to lend any more clarity to the situation other than I'm a class 7 holder and the sale price is $10MM which seems very low given that the Schedule of Assets and liabilities indicated $151MM assets, and $17MM in Liabilities...

I was thinking at what options I have to edge me from large swings of USD/EU exchange. Investing them in stock is not an option due to the very short time horizon. I was observing that part of the exchange fluctuations depend on the interest rate differential expectations. So I was wondering if it makes sense to move some of these money to short term bond funds. The rationale is that if interest rates go down in US the USD will loose against EU but I would recover this from the increase of the fund. Viceversa, if they go up I would recover the loss of the bond with the more favorable exchange. Does this make sense? Or do you have any other hedge idea to consider?",1701370947.0
Some words on the death of Charlie Munger,30,1878hkg,investing,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1878hkg/some_words_on_the_death_of_charlie_munger/,10,"Rest in peace Charlie Munger. I hope he passes on his immense wealth, wisdom and genetic need for Goggle glasses to the generations to come. With assiduity and equanimity, I hope we can all learn something from his common sense principles, derived from some of the greatest minds in contemporary history.

His wealth of knowledge and common sense was greater and exceeded the utility of that which most tertiary institutions teach us these days, consistent with his criticism of modern day universities run by idiots. 

He studied mathematics, was a metrologist, turned top knotch businessman, using methods and principals he always claimed were elementary. Buy good businesses at fair prices, not fair businesses at good prices.

Investing has a lot more to do with conscientiousness, emotionally stability and risk tolerance than brains. Buy when there's blood on the streets. Not, when a house will get a tulip.

He was Warren Buffett's right hand man, and his approach to life, investing and writing speaks volumes about how life doesn't need to complex. Infact it seems to me, very very smart people make life simple, communicate simple and follow simple principles. 

When financial institutions try to make things as complex a possible, we get events like the GFC, an entire asset class propped up by actuarial valuations no one actually understands. He was a very smart man, and brought a moral compass to the field of finance. I hope he rests in peace, amen.",1701314558.0

What I don't really understand is the bulk of the money was already in there and should have been getting the same returns as the fund.

Recently I've taken to selling chunks of my holdings whenever I see a pretty big increase weekly or daily (usually 3% or more), and increasing my holdings when I see a similar large downturn, especially with stocks I'm intending to go long on. I find that regardless of whether I profit from the arrangement or not in the short term, I do walk away with more shares in my in investment than I had before with the same initial investment, which in the long term seems to me like a worthwhile little optimization to make, especially when it comes to shares that pay dividends. I can often scoop up an extra fifth of a share at a time in the process. Even if the share continues to increase after I sell it, I find this fine given that I still have a considerable amount held in it, so in the event it won't make it down to a lower price for me to scoop up extra fractionals, I can just put it towards other investments instead. 

This seems to piss off both of my sets of investor friends, whether long term or short term. My short term minded friends hate it because it cuts into short term profits by selling off stock that is currently increasing, and my long term minded friends hate it because of it how it tries to time the market, and I should just let the shares collect their dividends instead.

It‚Äôs been a while since anyone has posted about this subject and wanted to see what people think about it now. I am considering lump summing in January, but am not sure if this is a good idea.

Overview:  $5/month for Membership

3% IRA match (Must hold gold membership for a year) + (Hold IRA for minimum 5 years)

$1000 0% Margin Funds (Theoretically put this into 4.9% APY then pay back $1000?)

1% Transfers for IRA‚Äôs and 401k‚Äôs

4.9% APY (I know T-Bills are better, I currently use them)

So the math= 

$5 x 12 = $60/yr

$1000 in 4.9% APY = $49 when you must pay back $1000. This essentially means your membership is $11 until rates lower back down

If IRA contribution limit is $7000 next year, this means they will match you $210 of TAX ADVANTAGED money. Having this compound over the years will be huge. (if your time horizon allows.

I am new to this forum, so I hope I am phrasing my inquiry appropriately. I understand that this isn't the place for personal finance advice, so please feel free to answer more generally.

I am about to inherit a significant sum, and plan to invest it in boring index funds (either an S&P index fund or VUG), and just leave it there until I retire in 20 or 25 years.

From my reading on the topic, I understand that it is basically impossible for laymen like me to time the market correctly.

So what I'm thinking is the following. Throw the funds into 3 or 6 month CD's (currently 5%+ APR), invest 10 percent or so of the total when the CD's mature, and then roll the rest of it over. Repeat for 5 or 6 years until it's all in the market.

The CD would provide a small return, while reducing risk that I am accidentally investing at a market high.

Is this market timing problem enough of a worry to bother with such an elaborate process? 

Or is missing out on 4-5 years of growth for those later investments a bigger risk?

I spendy $1000 today, and looking at the info page on my broker, I am roughly entitled to $70 of Apple, $65 of Amazon, on down the line until I have $0.002 of some other company, all totalling $1000.  Someone else comes along and buys SPY, buy since I've bought the shares I did, they end spending $1000.45 on the next available shares.

If a few million people do this, and people aren't willing to sell SPY at the same price, theoretically, you could see the lowest shares available going up, say to $1200 for the same assets... despite the underlying shares only having moved a little.

Hey everyone,  
Recently, my brokerage app (BUX) decided to call it quits. One of the features I really enjoyed was the adjustable leverage, or 'multiplier' as they referred to it. To give you an idea, I could initiate a position of ‚Ç¨500 at 2x leverage. If I wanted to tweak that leverage to, let's say, 10x, it would convert to ‚Ç¨100 at 10x leverage.  
This feature allowed me to start with a lower risk/multiplier in an index fund and then adjust it when the stock price was on the rise. Now, I'm on the lookout for another broker that offers a similar functionality, but it's proving to be a bit challenging.  
Any recommendations or insights into brokers with adjustable leverage would be greatly appreciated. Thanks a bunch!",1701079458.0

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus reportedly discussing cheap bundle plan to take on Netflix,189,188i79a,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/188i79a/apple_tv_plus_and_paramount_plus_reportedly/,72,"https://www.techradar.com/streaming/apple-tv-plus-and-paramount-plus-reportedly-discussing-cheap-bundle-plan-to-take-on-netflix

According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), two of the world's most underrated streamers have held talks about creating a cost-effective bundle to put a stop to Netflix's dominance of the streaming landscape. People familiar with the discussions reportedly told the WSJ that Apple TV Plus and Paramount Plus aren't just looking to end Netflix's reign as the world's best streaming service. Per the US outlet's sources, the duo are also said to want to offer their services as a joint enterprise in a bid to save people money. Indeed, the two companies are believed to have had meaningful dialog about offering said bundle at a cheaper price than subscribing to both streamers separately ‚Äì a deal that would surely pique the interest of customers operating on a budget.

If the WSJ's report is correct ‚Äì the outlet is keen to stress talks are still in the early stages ‚Äì the potential bundling of Paramount Plus and Apple TV Plus into a single package could have a big impact on the wider streaming industry. For one, the world's eight biggest streamers have all raised their prices over the past 12 months ‚Äì some, such as Disney Plus and Max, have done so twice in less than a year in the US. That's placed undue pressure on people who are subscribed to multiple services, with many forced to choose which one (or, at a push two) to stay with as the cost of living continues to bite.

The bundling of Paramount and Apple's platforms, then, would be seen as a significant move. Like their rivals, the pair have increased their subscription fees in 2023 ‚Äì Apple TV Plus' major price hike was particularly irksome to me ‚Äì and, while each one has some great content to offer customers, their back catalogs aren't on a par with Netflix, Prime Video, or even Hulu. Apple TV Plus' library only consists of first-party (albeit mostly terrific) offerings, while Paramount Plus doesn't have the strength in depth from first and third-party perspectives to compete with the world's most popular services.",1701453708.0

However, following its near 300% rise from that low point, perceptions have shifted drastically. This flip-flop in attitude underlines a critical aspect of investing: market sentiment is often driven by emotion rather than fundamentals. If META, or any big name for that matter, dropped by 50% again, history suggests that the majority of investors would shy away, not jump in.

This pattern is a classic example of the behavioral economics at play in the stock market, where fear and greed often override logical decision-making.

Additionally, Merck and Daiichi Sankyo entered a joint venture to develop and commercialize three potential ADCs in a deal worth up to $22 billion. The trend suggests a growing focus on ADCs within the pharmaceutical industry.

Alibaba dips on MS downgrade as PDD grabs spot of most valuable Chinese e-commerce firm,5,188f2l8,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/188f2l8/alibaba_dips_on_ms_downgrade_as_pdd_grabs_spot_of/,0,"(Reuters) -U.S.-listed shares of Alibaba Group Holding (BABA) declined on Friday following a Morgan Stanley downgrade on concerns over slower turnaround in its key businesses, hours after PDD raced past its rival to become the most valuable Chinese e-commerce firm.

Alibaba's (BABA) stock slipped 3.2% to $72.5, touching a fresh one-year low. The shares are down nearly 17% since the company last month posted in line second-quarter revenue and scrapped plans to spin off its cloud business.

Meanwhile, shares of PDD Holdings (PDD) have surged this week following stellar quarterly results from the Temu parent. The company closed with a market capitalization of nearly $196 billion on Thursday, surpassing Alibaba's (BABA) market value of $190.45 billion.

Morgan Stanley analysts downgraded Alibaba (BABA) to ""equal-weight"" from ""overweight"", flagging concerns over softness in its customer management revenue and cloud business due to sagging economic recovery in China.

They also noted uncertainties from Alibaba's (BABA) decision to scrap the spin-off of its cloud business.

Morgan Stanley cut its price target on the stock to $90 from $110, the second lowest among analysts, as per LSEG data. The downgrade is the third in as many weeks by Wall Street brokerages.

Alibaba's (BABA) U.S. shares, down about 18% so far this year, are set for their third consecutive year of losses.

On the other hand, Morgan Stanley named PDD as its top pick in the sector, saying the company is best placed to navigate the current economic environment with its heavy discounting steps.

""We expect PDD to continue to gain share in the domestic market thanks to its favorable business model amid consumers' behavior shift,"" Morgan Stanley's Eddy Wang noted, adding that its cross-border e-commerce business, Temu, is not fully valued by the market.

PDD shares were down 2.1% at $144.4 but have surged almost 80% in 2023, handily outperforming its peers.

At 21.4, PDD has the highest forward price-to-earnings ratio among rivals including JD.com (JD) and Vipshop Holdings. Alibaba's (BABA) forward PE was 7.62, according to LSEG estimates.",1701445696.0

General Motors (GM) faced a $1.1 billion hit in pretax earnings due to a six-week strike by autoworkers, but the company aims to absorb increased labor costs and proceed with a $10 billion stock buyback, representing nearly one-quarter of its $44 billion market value.  
  
 Despite a recent 11% surge in shares following the stock buyback announcement, they remain down about 27% in the past year. GM reinstated its full-year earnings forecast, anticipating net income of $9.1 billion to $9.7 billion. To achieve this, the company plans to cut capital spending, including slowing down investment in electric vehicles and its autonomous vehicle unit, Cruise.   
  
The company also expects to raise its dividend by 33% in January. GM faces increased labor costs due to new contracts with the United Auto Workers (UAW) and Canadian autoworkers, totaling $9.3 billion over the next four years and eight months. The contracts will raise top assembly plant worker pay by about 33% by April 2028. GM's CEO, Mary Barra, expressed disappointment in the stock's performance but remains confident in the company's future, focusing on greater efficiency and reduced costs.

It's that time of year again for port rebalancing. Looking for some clarification on the wash sale rule, and the best way to approach this scenario:

Unfortunately, I'm currently at $30k loss on ENPH. I have ITM CCs $95 expiring Dec 29.

If I let my CCs get called away and realize the $30k loss for tax year 2023, and buy back into ENPH first week of January 2024, I can still report the $30k loss on tax year 2023, right? The wash sale would then apply to tax year 2024? But then if I expect ENPH to recover in 2024 with the Feds decreasing interest rates, then the wash sale wouldn't be relevant?

A Glencore-led (GLEN.L) consortium, including Nippon Steel, sealed one of the mining sector's biggest deals in years this month, agreeing to buy Canadian miner Teck Resources' (TECKb.TO) steelmaking coal unit for $9 billion. The Japanese company will pay around $1.34 billion for a 20% stake.

""Coking coal prices are expected to rise as supply will get tighter in the medium term as there has been little investment in mines due to carbon-neutral push,"" executive vice president Takahiro Mori told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday.

""So, it's extremely important to secure our own interests,"" he said.

Japan's top steelmaker already owns stakes in several coking coal mines, which account for about a fifth of its annual coal imports totalling 25 million metric tons. The latest deal will boost that share to around 30%.

Annual inflation in the euro zone cooled to 2.4% in November from 2.9% in October, flash figures showed Thursday.

Economists polled by Reuters expected a reading of 2.7%.

Core inflation ‚Äî a measure closely-watched by the European Central Bank that excludes the volatile effects of energy, food, alcohol and tobacco ‚Äî also came in lower than expected, dropping to 3.6% from 4.2% in October.

ECB officials have repeatedly stressed that it is too early to declare victory over price rises in the 20-member euro zone bloc, as they monitor potential pressures from wage increases and energy markets.

Headline inflation has now cooled significantly from the peak levels of 10.6% in October 2022. Bert Colijn, senior euro zone economist at ING, said in a Wednesday note that ‚Äúsluggish demand‚Äù should keep inflation on track toward 2%.

Inflation in the euro zone‚Äôs largest economies, Germany and France, has dropped to 2.3% and 3.8%, respectively.

Mathieu Savary, chief European strategist at BCA Research, said that traders would now be tempted to bring forward expectations for the timeline of the first ECB rate cut, but argued that the central bank‚Äôs concerns over labor market tightness continued to imply ‚Äúlater rather than sooner rate cuts.‚Äù

They are offering a 20% discounted option price of ¬£2.20, however Tesco shares are currently set at ¬£285.

This means I could put ¬£50 aside each month for 3 years. Save up ¬£1800 with a ¬£55 bonus. So ¬£1855 in total. Meaning I can purchase 843 shares at the Option Price. I know this doesn‚Äôt change so it will still be ¬£2.20 in 3 years time.

What is confusing me is that everywhere I look online for advice, all the numbers and maths make sense. Company A offer a discounted price at ¬£2 a share. The company rises to ¬£3 in that time, so you would make a profit. This all makes sense, but the numbers also make sense with a 20% discounted option rate.

I know for a fact, I will not be able to buy 843 shares of Tesco as ¬£2.20, and then sell at the actual share price of ¬£285. That would mean I pay in ¬£1800, but can sell at just under ¬£240k, providing Tesco share price is still ¬£285.

Conservative Supreme Court justices seem open to an attack on the Securities and Exchange Commission,326,1874lw8,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1874lw8/conservative_supreme_court_justices_seem_open_to/,104,"https://www.bostonglobe.com/2023/11/29/business/conservative-supreme-court-justices-seem-open-an-attack-securities-exchange-commission/

WASHINGTON ‚Äî Conservative Supreme Court justices on Wednesday seemed open to a challenge to how the Securities and Exchange Commission fights fraud, in a case that could could have far-reaching effects on other regulatory agencies.

A majority of the nine-member court suggested that people accused of fraud by the SEC should have the right to have their cases decided by a jury in federal court, instead of by the SEC‚Äôs in-house administrative law judges.

The justices heard more than two hours of arguments in the Biden administration‚Äôs appeal of a lower-court ruling that threw out stiff financial penalties imposed on hedge fund manager George R. Jarkesy by the SEC, which regulates securities markets.

‚ÄúThat seems problematic to say that the government can deprive you of your property, your money, substantial sums in a tribunal that is at least perceived as not being impartial,‚Äù Justice Brett Kavanaugh said.

Justice Department lawyer Brian Fletcher warned the justices that their decision could have effects reaching far beyond the SEC, noting that roughly two dozen agencies have similar enforcement schemes.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want you to think it‚Äôs just about the SEC,‚Äù Fletcher said.

The case is just one of several this term in which conservative and business interests are urging the court to constrict federal regulators. The court‚Äôs six conservatives already have reined them in, including in May‚Äôs decision sharply limiting their ability to police water pollution in wetlands.

In the Jarkesy case, the Democratic administration is relying on a 50-year-old decision in which the court ruled that in-house proceedings did not violate the Constitution‚Äôs right to a jury trial in civil lawsuits.

But Chief Justice John Roberts, signaling his concerns with the power of federal regulators, noted that ‚Äúthe impact of governmental agencies on daily life today is enormously more significant than it was 50 years ago.‚Äù

The court‚Äôs three liberal justices seemed sympathetic to the Biden administration‚Äôs arguments. Justice Elena Kagan, responding to Roberts, said that ‚Äúour problems have only gotten more complicated and difficult.‚Äù

Last year, a divided panel of the US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit in New Orleans ruled in favor of Jarkesy and his Patriot28 investment adviser group on three issues.

It found that the SEC‚Äôs case against him, resulting in a $300,000 civil fine and the repayment of $680,000 in allegedly ill-gotten gains, should have been heard in a federal court instead of before one of the SEC‚Äôs administrative law judges.

Although the Supreme Court basically dealt only with the federal court issue, the appellate panel also said Congress unconstitutionally granted the SEC ‚Äúunfettered authority‚Äù to decide whether the case should be tried in a court of law or handled within the executive branch agency. And it said laws shielding the commission‚Äôs administrative law judges from being fired by the president are unconstitutional.

Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod wrote the appellate opinion, joined by Judge Andrew Oldham. Elrod was appointed by President George W. Bush, and Oldham by President Donald Trump. Bush and Trump are Republicans.

Judge Eugene Davis, a nominee of President Ronald Reagan, also a Republican, dissented.

Jarkesy‚Äôs lawyers noted that the SEC wins almost all the cases it brings in front of the administrative law judges but only about 60 percent of cases tried in federal court.

The SEC was awarded more than $5 billion in civil penalties in the 2023 government spending year that ended Sept. 30, the agency said in a news release. It was unclear how much of that money came through in-house proceedings or lawsuits in federal court.

A decision in SEC v. Jarkesy, 22-859, is expected by early summer.",1701303707.0

Why do you think Warren Buffett hates Nike stock ($NKE) so much?,101,1871k1g,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1871k1g/why_do_you_think_warren_buffett_hates_nike_stock/,92,"In the 90s, Warren praised Phil Knight as a ""terrific operator"" when he was still CEO and the company has continued to do phenomenally well (all things considered) throughout subsequent leadership changes. At this time, Warren had made his infamous investment into Dexter Shoe which has gone down as one of his worst trades.

  
When asked one time about Nike during a shareholder meeting, he said he ""\[doesn't\] understand the competitive advantage of the business"", but that he does (ironically) understand the competitive advantage of Dexter Shoe. Berkshire Hathaway ($BRK.A) does own sportswear and sporting good companies like Spalding and Russell Athletic which he's admitted aren't great businesses. During the shareholder meeting where he praised Phil Knight, he said ""In terms of what we think of the stock, we keep all of those views to ourselves pretty much"". Meanwhile, it's up thousands of percent since then.

  
Nike has continued to be the standard in sportswear throughout decades. Even when tiny incumbents like Hoka One One or On Running ($ONON) come along to take smaller pieces of the pie, they typically fizzle out and Nike remains king - case and point: Under Armour ($UAA). This is common with disruption-proof premium apparel manufacturers who are the standard of their (non-niche) category like how Herm√®s (EPA: $RMS) dominates handbags and Louis Vuitton ($LVMUY) dominates luggage.

  
Warren has stressed the importance of brand as a moat countless times like in his Snickers example. Many of Berkshire's most iconic investments like Coca-Cola and Apple are examples of companies where the strong brand is critical to the moat. Nike is one of the gold standards of this, but Buffett talks about the stock as if it's a dog.

  
Why do you think Warren has been allergic to this stock for decades?

US economic growth for last quarter is revised up to a 5.2% annual rate,395,186q0dv,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186q0dv/us_economic_growth_for_last_quarter_is_revised_up/,114,"WASHINGTON (AP) ‚Äî Shrugging off higher interest rates, America's consumers spent enough to help drive the economy to a brisk 5.2% annual pace from July through September, the government reported Wednesday in an upgrade from its previous estimate.

The government had previously estimated that the economy grew at a 4.9% annual rate last quarter.

Wednesday's second estimate of growth for the July-September quarter confirmed that the economy sharply accelerated from its 2.1% rate from April through June. It showed that the U.S. gross domestic product ‚Äî the total output of goods and services ‚Äî grew at its fastest quarterly rate in nearly two years.

Consumer spending, the lifeblood of the economy, rose at a 3.6% annual rate from July through September ‚Äî still healthy but a downgrade from the previous estimate of 4%. The economy also received a lift from companies building inventories in anticipation of future sales. Also driving the third quarter growth was an uptick in spending and investment by governments at all levels, federal, state and local.

The U.S. economy, the world's largest, has proved resilient even as the Federal Reserve has raised its benchmark interest rate 11 times since March 2022 to fight the worst bout of inflation in four decades. Those higher interest rates have significantly increased consumer and business borrowing costs. But they have also helped ease inflationary pressures: Consumer prices rose 3.2% last month from 12 months earlier, a marked improvement from the 9.1% year-over-year inflation recorded in June 2022.

The U.S. job market is cooling from the red-hot levels of the past two years. But it's still healthy by historical standards: Employers are adding an average of 239,000 jobs a month this year. And the unemployment rate has come in below 4% for 21 straight months, the longest such streak since the 1960s.

The combination of easing inflation and resilient hiring has raised hopes the Fed can manage a so-called soft landing ‚Äî raising rates just enough to cool the economy and tame price increases without tipping the economy into recession.

Blackstone (BX) acquires pet care app Rover (ROVR) in $2.3 billion all-cash deal,33,1876i3s,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1876i3s/blackstone_bx_acquires_pet_care_app_rover_rovr_in/,19,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/blackstone-acquires-pet-care-app-172112513.html

Private equity giant Blackstone will acquire the pet care app Rover in an all-cash deal valued at $2.3 billion, the companies announced Wednesday. Shares of Rover climbed about 28% on news of the deal, which will pay Rover shareholders $11 per share. Blackstone said that amounts to a 61% premium over the Rover's average share price during the past 90 trading days. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2024, at which time Rover will no longer be a publicly-traded company. The agreement includes a 30-day period expiring on Dec. 29 in which Rover and its advisors can solicit and negotiate other acquisition offers.

Rover's board of directors have approved the acquisition and recommended that Rover shareholders do the same. Rover shares mostly bounced around under $7 each for most of the year before jumping earlier this month on a strong third-quarter earnings report. Rover earned 5 cents per share last quarter, better than the 3 cents per share analysts were expecting. Sales of $66.2 million in the period also beat Wall Street projections and were up 30% from the same period a year ago.  ‚ÄúWe believe Rover has a significant runway for growth as pet owners increasingly place a premium on high-quality care, flexibility and convenience,‚Äù said Tushar Gupta, a principal at Blackstone. Rover was founded in 2011, connecting pet owners with care providers who provide boarding, in-home pet sitting and dog walking, among other services. The Seattle-based company says from its inception through Sept. 30, more than 93 million services have been booked by more than 4 million pet owners with more than 1 million pet care providers paid across North America and Europe.",1701309017.0
US access and identity management giant Okta admits hackers accessed data on all customers during recent breach,188,186t716,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186t716/us_access_and_identity_management_giant_okta/,20,"https://techcrunch.com/2023/11/29/okta-admits-hackers-accessed-data-on-all-customers-during-recent-breach/

U.S. access and identity management giant Okta says hackers stole data about all of its customers during a recent breach of its support systems, despite previously stating that only a fraction of customers were affected. Okta confirmed in October that a hacker used a stolen credential to access its support case management system and steal customer-uploaded session tokens that could be used to break into the networks of Okta customers. Okta told TechCrunch at the time that around 1% of customers, or 134 organizations, were affected by the breach. In a blog post published on Wednesday, Okta chief security officer David Bradbury said the company has since determined that all of its customers are affected by the breach. Okta spokesperson Cat Schermann would not provide an exact figure when asked by TechCrunch, but Okta has around 18,000 customers, according to the company‚Äôs website, including 1Password, Cloudflare, OpenAI, and T-Mobile.

Bradbury said on September 28, a hacker ran and downloaded a report that contained data belonging to ‚Äúall Okta customer support system users.‚Äù For 99.6% of customers, hackers accessed only full names and email addresses, according to Okta, though in some cases they may also have accessed phone numbers, usernames and details of some employee roles. ‚ÄúWhile we do not have direct knowledge or evidence that this information is being actively exploited, there is a possibility that the threat actor may use this information to target Okta customers via phishing or social engineering attacks,‚Äù Bradbury said. The notorious Scattered Spider hacking group, also known as Oktapus, has previously leveraged various social engineering tactics to target the accounts of Okta customers, including Caesars Entertainment and MGM Resorts.

This is the latest of many security incidents impacting Okta. Last year, the company admitted that hackers stole some of its source code. A separate incident earlier in the year saw hackers post screenshots showing access to the company‚Äôs internal network after hacking into a company Okta used for customer service.",1701274605.0
"Charlie Munger, investing genius and Warren Buffett‚Äôs right-hand man, dies at age 99",5073,1866nwx,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1866nwx/charlie_munger_investing_genius_and_warren/,299,"Billionaire Charlie Munger, the investing sage who made a fortune even before he became Warren Buffett‚Äôs right-hand man at Berkshire Hathaway, has died at age 99.  
  
Munger died Tuesday, according to a press release from Berkshire Hathaway.  
  
In addition to being Berkshire vice chairman, Munger was a real estate attorney, chairman and publisher of the Daily Journal Corp., a member of the Costco board, a philanthropist and an architect.  
  
In early 2023, his fortune was estimated at $2.3 billion ‚Äî a jaw-dropping amount for many people but vastly smaller than Buffett‚Äôs unfathomable fortune, which is estimated at more than $100 billion.  
  
During Berkshire‚Äôs 2021 annual shareholder meeting, the then-97-year-old Munger apparently inadvertently revealed a well-guarded secret: that Vice Chairman Greg Abel ‚Äúwill keep the culture‚Äù after the Buffett era.  
  
Munger, who wore thick glasses, had lost his left eye after complications from cataract surgery in 1980.  
  
Munger was chairman and CEO of Wesco Financial from 1984 to 2011, when Buffett‚Äôs Berkshire purchased the remaining shares of the Pasadena, California-based insurance and investment company it did not own.  
  
Buffett credited Munger with broadening his investment strategy from favoring troubled companies at low prices in hopes of getting a profit to focusing on higher-quality but underpriced companies.  
  
An early example of the shift was illustrated in 1972 by Munger‚Äôs ability to persuade Buffett to sign off on Berkshire‚Äôs purchase of See‚Äôs Candies for $25 million even though the California candy maker had annual pretax earnings of only about $4 million. It has since produced more than $2 billion in sales for Berkshire.  
  
‚ÄúHe weaned me away from the idea of buying very so-so companies at very cheap prices, knowing that there was some small profit in it, and looking for some really wonderful businesses that we could buy in fair prices,‚Äù Buffett told CNBC in May 2016.  
  
Or as Munger put it at the 1998 Berkshire shareholder meeting: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not that much fun to buy a business where you really hope this sucker liquidates before it goes broke.‚Äù  
  
Munger was often the straight man to Buffett‚Äôs jovial commentaries. ‚ÄúI have nothing to add,‚Äù he would say after one of Buffett‚Äôs loquacious responses to questions at Berkshire annual meetings in Omaha, Nebraska. But like his friend and colleague, Munger was a font of wisdom in investing, and in life. And like one of his heroes, Benjamin Franklin, Munger‚Äôs insight didn‚Äôt lack humor.  
  
‚ÄúI have a friend who says the first rule of fishing is to fish where the fish are. The second rule of fishing is to never forget the first rule. We‚Äôve gotten good at fishing where the fish are,‚Äù the then-93-year-old Munger told the thousands of people at Berkshire‚Äôs 2017 meeting.  
  
He believed in what he called the ‚Äúlollapalooza effect,‚Äù in which a confluence of factors merged to drive investment psychology.

GM is spending on the new investor incentives despite high interest rates that are threatening car sales and capital burdens from its electric-vehicle effort, which has yet to show significant results.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban is selling a majority stake of the Dallas Mavericks to Miriam Adelson and her family, a source familiar with the deal told CNBC. Cuban still owns a stake in the team and will run basketball operations. Adelson is selling $2 billion worth of Las Vegas Sands stock, or roughly 10% of her stake, according to an announcement from the company. The proceeds will be used to buy a professional sports team, the casino company said in a filing Tuesday. Adelson and her family are the largest shareholders in Las Vegas Sands.

‚ÄúWe have been advised by the Selling Stockholders that they currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, along with additional cash on hand, to fund the purchase of a majority interest in a professional sports franchise pursuant to a binding purchase agreement, subject to customary league approvals,‚Äù Las Vegas Sands said in the filing.

Polo Ralph Lauren(RL) DCF Analysis,22,186oiiz,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186oiiz/polo_ralph_laurenrl_dcf_analysis/,6,"# Introduction:

RL is a well-loved brand that embodies middle-class luxury, it may not have the prestige of Gucci or Louis Vuitton but it is still well respected in its own rights and has recently been making shifts towards trying to be perceived as a more luxurious brand, attracting attention of both the middle-class and the upper echelons as well. RL's main way of growing the topline is marketing, through different marketing initiatives that try to appeal to and remain relevant to a broader range of audiences. With initiatives like the vegan fragrance ‚ÄúPolo Earth‚Äù, their appearance in the Winter Olympics, and breaking into TikTok.  


# Revenue:

When forecasting Revenue, I took into account ‚Äúour value perception, our quality score, and our purchase intent have strengthened through the pandemic, even with the backdrop of us taking pricing up 50% over the last two years.‚Äù - 2022 Q4 Earnings Conference. And, despite COVID-19, the War in Ukraine, and inflation RL seems resilient. Their customers are willing to spend despite worsening backdrop and price increases.  


When forecasting RL owned stores, I don‚Äôt believe this number will grow drastically as RL is trying to position itself as a luxury brand, so there needs to be a degree of ‚Äúscarcity‚Äù. So, I assumed a meager growth rate till perpetuity. Overall, store growth had a CAGR of 1.5% in my base case.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/RL owned stores, I assumed that Revenue/RL owned stores would increase at a meager pace at the start in order for the brand to be able to integrate more easily into consumers before accelerating price increase.  
  
When forecasting wholesale distribution doors, to avoid being overly granular I assumed that the door would increase at a meager pace in line with the historic average.  
  
When forecasting Revenue/Door, according to the 2023 Q4 Earnings conference (March 2023), wholesale is expected to suffer whereas full price store is expected to perform even better. This is a testament to how RL is perceived as a luxury brand as it is deemed way too expensive to price-conscious consumers who believe the brand is not worth the price. So, since wholesaler mainly targets price-conscious consumers, I assumed that revenue/door only grew in line with inflation.  


# COST:

According to management, the main drivers of cost increase are freight and cotton.  
Cotton going forward will be the largest hurdle to clear in order to reduce margins. ‚ÄúAUR growth of 12% and lower air freight were offset by peak levels of raw material costs, notably cotton‚Äù  
  
When forecasting COGS, 2022 numbers are skewed by elevated freight cost and cotton cost which continued increasing into 2023. However, according to the 2023 Q4 earnings conference management expects their hedging efforts against cotton price increase to show up in 2024. So I assumed that beyond 2024, management will keep their cost under control and COGS as a %sales will drop.  
  
When forecasting SG&A, according to management marketing spending is likely to remain constant as a % of sales. However, in the past 2 years labor is a cost that is likely elevated given the tight labor market so I assume that in 2 years' time, the labor market will loosen. On top of that, given management‚Äôs willingness to pivot their stores online, I argue that there is a lesser need for more employees per physical store which helps to reduce cost.  


# WACC:

**Cost of Equity**  
The US has a bond rating of AA+  
10Y T-Bond yield (1M Avg) = 4.67%  
AA+ Risk Spread (1M Avg) = 0.63

R = 10.3%, ERP = 6.26%  
Cost of Equity = 12.99%   
  
**Cost of Debt**

WACC = 10.42%  


# CONCLUSION:

Ultimately, in the base case, I value RL at $146.38 per share. I believe that RL is reasonably priced given its consistently strong performance over the years. Taking into account the fact that its sales prices have been consistently increasing and the worsening microenvironment, it still managed to increase its topline regardless. I believe management has taken the right direction in trying to improve the premium image of RL.

"Bullish on cruise line stocks? CCL, RCL, NCLH",11,186tyoi,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186tyoi/bullish_on_cruise_line_stocks_ccl_rcl_nclh/,14,"I feel like it's been a little while since I've seen stock discussion regarding cruise lines in this sub. Cruise lines had record breaking bookings this quarter, beating estimates. Carnival (CCL) is up 80% YTD and Royal Caribbean (RCL) is up 109% YTD. A few analysts have recently upgraded from Hold to Buy. The one head scratcher to me is Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH), only up 18% YTD.

I understand the argument is that during COVID, cruise lines accumulated ton of debt but in 2023 we have seen cut in debts as interest has risen. Carnival stated they have a 3-year plan to reduce debt with 3 ships coming in 2024, 1 ship in 2025 and 0 ships in 2026 it will allow them to use a ton of free cash flow to cut debts in the future. 

Other looming threats = fuel pricing from war and other factors.   
\- Carnival is focusing on reducing fuel usage, with having a 16% reduction in unit consumption of fuel in 2023.

Pre-covid, CCL was sitting around $50 and now is trading under $15. RCL was at $135, now at $106. NCLH was at $59, now under $15 as well.

I think I'm the most bullish on Carnival as a long-term buy/hold, as I like the direction CEO Josh Weinstein is taking the company.

I have dabbled in quick searches, and videos to understand options trading. I have not acted on my knowledge yet because I do not think its sufficient enough.

Each contract represents 100 shares. I know that. 

I understand that a call option is basically betting the price will rise above a certain number by a certain date. I understand that if it does, I have the right to excercise and purchase at the strike price, which would be lower than market price, and could sell for a profit..Correct?

I understand similar to puts. 

However my issue is that I am not fully understanding the risk and what potential strategies can be implemented. 

To my understanding, if I write a put option contract.. im essentially saying the share will fall below a specific price by a certain time. If it doesnt, then I am obligated to pay the option buyer the premium, and the contract valued at the strike price or market price?

 I was told one of these has unlimited loss potential. That is what I need to understand fully. 

If you have any input, or recommendations on where I can get this kind of information dumbed down, I would appreciate it!

It has been a flaming piece of garbage since 2014? ish IPO, but I cannot wrap my head around it not being underpriced at this number.  
Overview: PGRE is a reit that has existed since 1970s and owns 8 buildings in midtown manhattan and 6 in San Francisco. They are all class A buildings that are desirable and have long term value IMO.  
Reasons for low price: Everyone hates office space, tenants included both SVB and first republic bank, 2 big tenants moving out (credit Agricole and Clifford Chance), high rates, have not been growing FFO since IPO, 87% ish Occuopancy.  
Thesis: The company is not overleveraged with less than a 50% debt to-asset ratio and only owns Class A office buildings in midtown Manhattan and Market street San Francisco. Their debt maturity is not going to be overwhelming and is mostly in 2026 or later. I have faith in the office markets long term and think that its just currently out of fashion. It also is trading at 4.60 a share with 2 a share in cash and 16 a share in equity (mind boggling).  
Market Cap - $1b  
Cash on book - $400M

Reminder: PE doesn't work for valuing high growth companies.,110,1862tqm,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1862tqm/reminder_pe_doesnt_work_for_valuing_high_growth/,70,"I see a lot of focus on PE here and i get the impression that people don't know what PE is. PE looks back on the past 4 quarters of data and compares it to today's share price. The past 4 quarters is relevant for reasonably stagnant companies as you can assume the future value will be similar. If you want to value a growth company however you should not use this metric.

One of the best ways to illustrate this is to simply link a chart of PE for a high growth company. https://ycharts.com/companies/NVDA/pe_ratio 

See the step change every quarter? When a company is growing the previous quarters from a year ago weigh into the PE equation. You don't get to factor these out until the next quarterly report lands which leads to a massive step change as the recent quarter pushes the 1 year past quarter out of the equation. 

For high growth companies you're better off looking at forward PE. In this case it's 25x. Or if you want forward PE with growth there's PEG. In this case there's an expected 8% quarterly growth. 

I keep seeing posts complaining about the PE of high growth companies but i worry this is simply due to a lack of understanding on valuations. I hope this helps.",1701195842.0

"Shein files for U.S. IPO, as fast-fashion giant looks to resolve forced labor, climate concerns",40,1861gra,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1861gra/shein_files_for_us_ipo_as_fastfashion_giant_looks/,35,"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/11/27/shein-files-for-us-ipo-as-fast-fashion-giant-looks-to-expand-its-global-reach.html

Shein has confidentially filed to go public in the U.S. as the Chinese-founded fast-fashion juggernaut looks to expand its global reach with a long-rumored initial public offering, CNBC has learned.  The retailer was last valued at $66 billion and could be ready to start trading on the public markets as soon as 2024, people familiar with the matter said Monday.  A confidential filing is common, as it allows companies to communicate with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and make any necessary adjustments to their filings in private. Over the next few months, Shein will likely make tweaks to its paperwork and answer numerous questions from the agency. The filing will be made public once the company is ready to move forward with its IPO. At that point, those communications with the SEC and any adjustments to its paperwork will be released as well.

Shein has been on a meteoric rise over the past few years after it won over consumers across the globe with its fashion-forward designs, endless assortment and dirt-cheap prices. But Shein has faced a series of challenges along the way and faced accusations of using forced labor in its supply chain, violating labor laws, harming the environment and stealing designs from independent artists. The company is currently under investigation by the newly formed House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and has faced scrutiny over its ties to Beijing. Numerous lawmakers, including 16 Republican attorneys general, have called on the SEC to ensure Shein isn‚Äôt using forced labor in its supply chain before it‚Äôs allowed to start trading in the U.S. In October, Marcelo Claure, the company‚Äôs newly minted group vice chair and former SoftBank CEO, told CNBC in an interview that Shein is cooperating with lawmakers and taking time to meet with them to explain the business. He said, ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no such thing as forced labor‚Äù in the Shein factories that he has visited. But the company has repeatedly acknowledged that forced labor has been found in its supply chain and noted that it‚Äôs taking steps to fix it.

As Shein grew from an obscure Chinese retailer into a global behemoth with headquarters in Singapore, it largely stayed in the shadows. It said and did very little publicly until this year, when it began to open up in an apparent attempt to prepare for a U.S. IPO. Recently, it acquired about one-third of Sparc Group ‚Äî a joint venture that includes brand management firm Authentic Brands Group and mall owner Simon Property Group ‚Äî and in doing so, made a powerful U.S. ally that could help legitimize the company in the eyes of U.S. regulators. As part of the deal, Shein has partnered up with former rival Forever 21 to unveil a co-branded clothing line that will see Shein design, manufacture and distribute the clothes primarily on its website. Shein has been hosting pop-up events inside of Forever 21‚Ä≤s stores.",1701192441.0

I don't see any way things don't take off but most of what  i read says CHPT is a big risk with a questionable future.

If you were having this conversation after the dot com bubble in 2000 you might say ""wow, Amazon is really on its ass"".  But even then  the internet was growing by 20% a month and Amazon was the best online retailer.    So  no matter how bad it looked, there was no scenario you could envision that would take amazon out of the  equation.

I feel like we are in a similar moment.  EV growth is inevitable.   All you have to do is suck less than your competitors and CHPT seems to meet that criteria.

I am pretty clear that this applies to the wash rule so I won't be able to claim any of these losses from 1. to offset my gains.

It was in my understanding that when this happens, the loss is instead added to the cost basis of my new investment (which I think is the RSUs that vested on 11/15).  
but my question is, I have also sold these new investments at the same time 2.

does this mean, I even lose/forfeit the opportunity to add these losses to the cost basis of my new investment? or does this carry forward somehow until I vest or purchase the same/similar stocks at a future date? (I literally sold all of em)

*Reporting a Wash Sale Loss*

*The good news is that any loss realized on a wash sale is not entirely lost.* ***Instead, the loss can be applied to the cost basis of the most recently purchased substantially identical security***\*. Not only does this addition increase the cost basis of the purchased securities, but it also reduces the size of any future taxable gains as a result.\*

*Thus, the investor still receives credit for those losses, but at a later time. Also, the holding period of the wash sale securities is added to the holding period of the repurchased securities, which increases an investor‚Äôs odds of qualifying for the 15% favorable tax rate on long-term capital gains.*",1701236070.0

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

Is anyone buying the narrative Black Friday sales were so amazing this y ear?,0,186y70l,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/186y70l/is_anyone_buying_the_narrative_black_friday_sales/,99,"Okay so I'm coming at this as someone in eCommerce so the discussion below is kind of framed around that but was curious your guys thoughts.

So once again we've been told this year is the biggest black friday ever in terms of sales. Well first off I'm not buying it and I'll get into that further below, but I had a question if anyone knows as most of these articles are pretty vague. Here's what I'm wondering...

1. Where are they pulling these stats from? Is it from a merchant processor, Shopify, Visa or MC or retail organization?
2. Are these numbers just factoring in Black Friday and Cyber Monday, the entire week around Black Friday or the entire month of November?

EDIT
So it depends on what articles you read some of these numbers come from industry associations while others are coming from companies like Adobe. In terms of what period of time these articles are looking at a lot of the ones I'm reading are specifically about Black Friday which make this claim even more unbelievable to me. Black Friday/Cyber Monday is no longer a Friday to Monday thing, its become at the very least a Monday before thanksgiving to Cyber Monday thing with most retailers extending sales to Tues or Wed so in reality were talking like a 8 or 9 day event and that's not even considering the businesses who are essentially making the entire month of November a sale. I would expect that to dilute sales on the actual Black Friday day which is the day many of these articles are referencing

So here's my take on this. Last year we were told it was the biggest Black Friday ever. Well I went to a few stores and they were emptier than a regular Tuesday afternoon, obviously more people shop online these but I still don't buy its the best sales numbers ever. Last year inflation was running 9% and we were told best black friday ever by 2.3% though I believe that was later revised down, same thing that happens with GDP, job numbers, everything, they give rosy numbers make headlines and revise down later and nobody really pays attention.

That said assuming the same number of shoppers went out and bought the same number of items you'd expect sales would need to at a minimum be 9% higher than previous years adjusted for inflation to be break even, you'd need more to actually say sales were better. And this is if we buy the idea that inflation was only 9% which the fed and government told us, obviously they pick and choose what's factored so true inflation is actually much higher.

I would expect things to be worse this year, we've had more layoffs, we now have an additional year of high inflation so people are even more tapped out ie its not just the 3% inflation we have this year if you buy that number, were going on 3 or 4 years of inflation which has accumulated and driven prices higher. We also have record credit card debt, record low savings levels, etc.

I just find it hard to believe this years black friday and cyber monday sales were 7% or 9% depending on the source better than previous years. Assuming they are only looking at the weekend or even the whole week its even harder to believe as in many ways the entire month of November has turned into the month of black friday. Curious your take as well as your personal experience if you're in ecommerce. My sales were about the same as last year which is great, margins were a bit worse, but we've also substantially grown our emails and sms lists over the past year, had that not happenned I'd expect my sales would be considerably worse.

TLDR

So after writing this I dug into some more numbers, read a few more articles. Here's my take. eCommerce has grown over the years and will continue to grow, it got a big boost during covid but will continue to grow as time goes on. Black Friday in store is pretty much a thing of the past at this point so what we're seeing is a shuffle of brick and mortar sales becoming ecommerce sales which is why Adobe is reporting how amazing their users sales were. Then the obvious things are costing what say 30% more today than they were 3 years ago. What does all that mean, Black Friday sales were likely pretty fucking terrible if they are A. inflation adjusted and B. if there wasn't a natural movement of brick and mortar sales becoming ecommerce sales.",1701287066.0
LATAM Airline Analysis - PreCovid vs Now,2,1864o3k,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/1864o3k/latam_airline_analysis_precovid_vs_now/,2,"I have been thinking about this stock for a long time and though I had miss the chance but there is still a huge potential now that I've analysed a bit deeper.

LATAM Group Airline is the top airline in Latin America and it is the result of merging two top airlines, the Chilean LAN and the Brazilian TAM in 2010.It is a quality service airline, not a budget one. I personally loved it and for the europoors in the room, it felt like British Airways experience.

In COVID, the company filed for administration and a huge dillution happened in the process where debt holders were given shares in exchange of debt. That resulted in cleaning the debt from the balance sheet and having a huge equity base (of course, no good for old shareholders)Now, the company is back to business. 

See the three main data below from the recent 2023-Q3 report.

1. The n¬∫ of passengers transported is slightly above 3Q 2019 -> [https://snipboard.io/60Hzli.jpg](https://snipboard.io/60Hzli.jpg)
2. The debt has gone down from $7.5bn to $4bn -> [https://snipboard.io/P4Q9rD.jpg](https://snipboard.io/P4Q9rD.jpg)
3. And as per the income statement, you can see that it has gone through a hell of a 2 years post-lockdown and filing administration, and now is reporting highet benefits than pre-covid 3Q-2019 comparable period: -> [https://snipboard.io/D1tOaJ.jpg](https://snipboard.io/D1tOaJ.jpg)

The company is valued similarly as it was pre-covid BUT with less debt on the balance sheet, that makes this airline less leverage, so more space to leverage and expand/grow their operations (more routes, aircrafts or even acquisition of small airlines via debt).

So, with the business volume back to prepandemic level but with less debt, the valuation should be much higher. Do we agree?

That's why, I beleive the stock has still a run from the current level. See how other airlines compare in valuation:[https://companiesmarketcap.com/airlines/largest-airlines-by-market-cap/](https://companiesmarketcap.com/airlines/largest-airlines-by-market-cap/)

As you can see, Ryan Air tops 1 (this was my main DD last year and I had presented to the audience of wsb who laughed at me... good profits I made), and LATAM is still ranking in the 22. A lot of airlines ranking above are not good performers as LATAM is.

The company trades in the OTC post-administration filing. But it does trade in Chilean main stock index as a bluechip that it is in the country and regional market.",1701200406.0

* The diabetes drug Mounjaro is more effective for weight loss than Ozempic in overweight or obese adults, according to a large analysis of real-world data.

* The results come as both drugs and similar treatments approved for weight loss soar in demand in the U.S. for their ability to help patients shed unwanted pounds over time.

The blockbuster diabetes drug Mounjaro is more effective for weight loss than another highly popular treatment, Ozempic, in overweight or obese adults, according to a large analysis of real-world data published Monday.

Patients taking Eli Lilly
‚Äôs Mounjaro were significantly more likely to lose 5%, 10% and 15% of their body weight overall and saw larger reductions in body weight after three months, six months and a year compared with those on Novo Nordisk

‚Äôs Ozempic in the study by Truveta Research. The firm compiles and analyzes patient data from a collective of health-care systems. 

The results come as both drugs and similar treatments approved for weight loss soar in demand in the U.S. for their ability to help patients shed unwanted pounds over time. The wider adoption has boosted shares of Eli Lilly and Novo Nordisk this year.

Mounjaro and Ozempic are only approved for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes, but many people use the weekly injections off-label to lose weight. 

Previous head-to-head studies have similarly suggested that Mounjaro is more effective than Ozempic for weight loss and controlling blood sugar in adults with Type 2 diabetes. 

But Monday‚Äôs study confirms Mounjaro‚Äôs edge over Ozempic in a real-world setting, specifically among adults who are overweight or obese. Notably, head-to-head clinical trials in that population are not yet available, according to Truveta Research. 

Eli Lilly is pitting Mounjaro against Wegovy, a higher dose version of Ozempic approved for weight loss, in an ongoing clinical trial in obese or overweight patients. But results won‚Äôt be released until next year.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been able to compare the head-to-head efficacy of these two important medications for weight loss in advance of randomized clinical trials,‚Äù said Dr. Nick Stucky, an author of the study and vice president of Truveta Research, in a statement. ‚ÄúThis study can help to inform patient care and outcomes today, not months from now.‚Äù

**Study results on Mounjaro and Ozempic**

Truveta Research specifically examined health-care data on roughly 18,000 adults who are overweight or obese and first started taking Mounjaro or Ozempic between May 2022 and September 2023. Nearly 52% of those patients had Type 2 diabetes.

Researchers found that patients taking Mounjaro were three times more likely to lose 15% of their weight than those on Ozempic. Patients on Mounjaro were also 2.6 times more likely to achieve 10% weight loss and 1.8 times more likely to lose 5% of their weight.

Those taking Mounjaro also experienced ‚Äúsignificantly larger reductions‚Äù in body weight at specific time points, according to Truveta Research.

At three months, patients on Mounjaro lost 5.9% of their weight, while those on Ozempic lost 3.6%. At six months, people taking Mounjaro lost 10.1% of their weight, while patients on Ozempic lost 5.9%. And at one year, those on Mounjaro lost 15.2% of their weight, while those on Ozempic lost 7.9%.

Truveta Research also found that patients without Type 2 diabetes lost more weight than those with the condition. But the differences in effectiveness between Mounjaro and Ozempic were similar in both populations.

Rates of adverse gastrointestinal events were similar between patients taking Mounjaro and Ozempic.

**The big difference between the weekly injections**

Mounjaro and Ozempic are both weekly injections that change the way patients eat and lead to decreased appetite by mimicking certain hormones in the gut. They both have weight loss drug counterparts that use the same active ingredient: Eli Lilly‚Äôs newly approved Zepbound and Novo Nordisk‚Äôs Wegovy.

Ozempic and Wegovy only mimic one hunger-regulating hormone called glucagon-like peptide-1, also known as GLP-1, which increases the feeling of fullness and lowers blood sugar levels.

Meanwhile, Mounjaro and Zepbound mimic GLP-1 and another hormone in the gut called glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, or GIP.

The dual approach means that Mounjaro and Zepbound have an enhanced effect on regulating appetite and blood sugar levels, which some experts say could potentially lead to more significant weight loss than medications only targeting GLP-1. 

In a late-stage study of more than 2,500 adults with obesity but not diabetes, those taking 5 milligrams of Zepbound for 72 weeks lost about 16% of their body weight on average. Higher doses of the drug were associated with even more weight loss, with a 15-milligram dose leading to 22.5% weight loss on average.

More than two in five adults have obesity, according to the National Institutes of Health. 

About one in 11 adults have severe obesity.",1701100208.0

"FT - ECB to discuss earlier end to bond purchases, says Christine Lagarde",11,185kpdp,stocks,https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/185kpdp/ft_ecb_to_discuss_earlier_end_to_bond_purchases/,1,"https://www.ft.com/content/d7e98c98-51ef-4a0f-a27c-f08a7f6374a7

* Pandemic-era ‚Ç¨1.7tn stimulus programme had been due to wind down by end 2024

* Christine Lagarde has said the European Central Bank is likely to discuss speeding up the shrinkage of its balance sheet by ending the last of its bond purchases earlier than planned.

* The ECB president‚Äôs comments at a hearing in the European parliament on Monday are the clearest sign to date that the bank is preparing to further tighten monetary policy ‚Äî beyond its earlier interest rate rises ‚Äî by reducing the amount of bonds it plans to buy next year.

Several of the more hawkish members of the ECB have been calling for these reinvestments to end, saying the extra monetary stimulus is inconsistent with efforts to tame inflation by raising rates. They also point out that the pandemic crisis that initially justified the purchases has clearly ended. 

The ECB stopped much of its bond-buying last year. But it is still reinvesting the proceeds of maturing securities in the ‚Ç¨1.7tn portfolio it started buying in response to the pandemic and has set out plans to continue doing so until at least the end of next year.

‚ÄúThis is a matter which will come probably for discussion and consideration within the governing council in the not too distant future and we will re-examine possibly this proposal,‚Äù Lagarde told MEPs.

However, the reinvestments in the pandemic emergency purchase portfolio (PEPP) are useful for the ECB because it has the flexibility to skew them towards the debt of any particular country suffering a widening of its borrowing costs compared to others. 

Some of the more dovish policymakers have argued against abandoning this ‚Äúfirst line of defence‚Äù against financial fragmentation at a time when investors are becoming increasingly nervous about stagnant growth and high debt levels in many European countries, such as Italy.

The ECB‚Äôs overall bond holdings represent about 30 per cent of all eligible debt in the eurozone. It has already ended reinvestments in its ‚Ç¨3tn asset purchase programme ‚Äî a separate pool of assets it started buying in 2015. Lagarde said this so-called quantitative tightening had led to its balance sheet shrinking by ‚Ç¨23bn a month on average this year. 

Francesco Maria Di Bella, a fixed-income analyst at Italian bank UniCredit, estimated the ECB would buy bonds worth ‚Ç¨180bn next year as part of its planned PEPP reinvestments.

While falling government deficits in many countries are expected to reduce the supply of bonds being sold next year, the ‚Äúnet supply that has to be absorbed by markets is set to rise due to the ECB‚Äôs quantitative tightening‚Äù, he said in a note to clients. ‚ÄúThe picture could become more challenging if the ECB decides to start to run off of its PEPP portfolio.‚Äù

Most analysts expect the ECB to stagger the reduction of its PEPP reinvestments rather than halting them abruptly, to avoid spooking investors. 

Jens Eisenschmidt, chief European economist at Morgan Stanley, has forecast the ECB will cut PEPP reinvestments by half for six months in April before ending them completely in October. He calculated this would shrink the central bank‚Äôs bond portfolio by ‚Ç¨87bn by the end of next year and ‚Ç¨258bn by the end of 2025.

The total balance sheet of the ECB and the national central banks that make up the Eurosystem has shrunk from almost ‚Ç¨9tn to ‚Ç¨7tn since last year, largely due to the repayment of cheap loans extended to banks in the pandemic. 

However, at more than 60 per cent of eurozone gross domestic product, the ECB has a bigger relative balance sheet than either the US Federal Reserve or the Bank of England, both of which have already completely stopped bond purchases.",1701137096.0

Pan African is a mid tier gold miner based in South Africa, it‚Äôs had a tough year but has recovered well, and I reckon it respresents a bit of a bargain.

Bull Case:

1- Forward p/e in low single digits, industry average is 10.

2- Potential for takeover (see recent Wheaton International deal)

3- Smart management. Moves to invest fairly heavily in solar panels; and plans to invest in wind power look very smart now, and save the company a few ¬£100,000 a year. Projects are delivered consistently on time and on budget.

4- Oversold due to lowered production guidance (~185,000 this year, rather than 200,000oz) which was mostly caused by South African national grid problems. 

5- Reliable dividend (~5% yield at current prices. 

6- High gold price at the moment ($2,000 per oz) and decently low aisc (all in sustaining cost) around ~$1400 per oz.

7- Organic growth. Mintails project set to deliver in 2024 will increase production by 50,000oz 

8- Rock solid finances, high margins, low debt, consistent positive cash flows.

* Investors assume cuts in the next four months.

* Interest-rate futures indicated last week a roughly 60% chance the Fed will lower rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point by its May 2024 policy meeting, up from 29% at the end of October, according to CME Group data. The same data has pointed to four cuts by the end of the year.


Twenty months after the Federal Reserve began a historic campaign against inflation, investors now believe there is a much greater chance that the central bank will cut rates in just four months than raise them again in the foreseeable future.

Interest-rate futures indicated last week a roughly 60% chance the Fed will lower rates by a quarter-of-a-percentage point by its May 2024 policy meeting, up from 29% at the end of October, according to CME Group data. The same data has pointed to four cuts by the end of the year.

Investors, battered by the Fed‚Äôs efforts to slow the economy, have reacted by driving the S&P 500 up nearly 9% this month. That is despite the wagers reflecting different possible paths for the economy, not all of them favorable for stocks. 

One place where rate-cut bets are showing up is in the bond market, where yields on longer-term bonds have retreated further below those on short-term ones. Treasury yields largely reflect expectations for what short-term rates set by the Fed will average over the life of a bond. As a result, such a move is typically viewed as a warning of a looming recession, with investors betting the Fed will need to slash rates to stimulate growth.

This month‚Äôs rally in stocks signals many investors anticipate a more benign outcome. Their hope: inflation falls back to the Fed‚Äôs 2% target, growth remains steady, but the Fed cuts rates a modest amount anyway as insurance against an unnecessary slowdown.

Still, there is evidence that traders are betting on both economic scenarios. Investors celebrated this month‚Äôs round of inflation reports, which showed a broad deceleration in price increases. But there has also been a string of more worrisome data, including weaker-than-expected surveys of purchasing managers and an uptick in the unemployment rate.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre really talking about a distribution of outcomes that range between the Fed doing nothing next year to the Fed cutting aggressively next year,‚Äù said Rob Waldner, fixed income chief strategist at Invesco.

Waldner is among those who believe the threat of a recession has increased. But he said his base case is still that the Fed delivers insurance cuts without a downturn. 

Investors caution that it is still possible that the Fed doesn‚Äôt cut rates in 2024, potentially pushing bond yields higher again. The U.S. economy over the past couple of years has proved resilient, and the Fed has repeatedly raised rates higher than investors were expecting.

Even if inflation continues to moderate, the Fed is less likely to cut the better the economy performs, said Thanos Bardas, global co-head of investment-grade fixed income at Neuberger Berman. There are signs that consumers and businesses ‚Äúhave adapted to the higher-interest-rate regime,‚Äù he said.

The stock market‚Äôs recent surge marks a shift from the previous three months, when longer-term yields shot higher, bets on rate cuts were scaled back and stocks generally slumped, while data showed a jump in economic growth.

Investors say there are reasons why stocks can thrive when growth is slowing and even when the chances of a moderate downturn are rising. 

All else equal, lower long-term Treasury yields can boost stocks by reducing the incentive for investors to shift their money into bonds. Investors had also feared that a 10-year Treasury yield approaching 5% could trigger a recession by pushing up borrowing costs for businesses and consumers, even if those fears weren‚Äôt showing up in bond yields themselves.

Adding to those concerns, many worried that yields were being driven higher by a surge in new Treasurys needed to fund a growing federal budget deficit, not just by a strong economy and bets on higher-for-longer rates.

This month‚Äôs bond rally, which has pulled the 10-year yield below 4.5%, got its start on Nov. 1 when the Treasury Department boosted auction sizes of longer-term bond sales by less than most investors were expecting. That bolstered the case that yields had climbed more than was justified by economic fundamentals, making their decline especially welcome.

Fed officials have consistently said that they aren‚Äôt close to discussing rate cuts.

But they have also signaled that they expect to lower rates, even absent a recession, once they are confident that inflation will reach their objective. In their last forecast in September, the median official expected rates to end next year a half of a percentage point lower than at the start of the year, or a quarter of a percentage point below where they are now.

‚ÄúThe time will come at some point, and I‚Äôm not saying when, that it‚Äôs appropriate to cut,‚Äù Fed Chair Jerome Powell said in September. 

Investors‚Äô new positioning on rates reflects other factors than their baseline forecasts. Many think that the Fed will likely cut rates by less than 1 percentage point next year. But they still are making that wager because they see a reasonable chance of even larger cuts.

In past recessions, the Fed has typically cut rates by about 3 to 4 percentage points over a year, said Sonu Varghese, global macro strategist at Carson Group, a financial advisory firm. As a result, bets on the Fed cutting rates by 1 percentage point could be interpreted as investors believing that there is a 25% to 33% chance of a recession in 2024.  

However, taking into account bets on more modest insurance cuts, the perceived chance of a recession should be seen as lower, perhaps around 20%, Varghese said.",1701095230.0

"30-Day Challenge #12: Get involved with charity! (December, 2023)",4,188balt,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188balt/30day_challenge_12_get_involved_with_charity/,1,"# 30-day challenges

We are pleased to continue our 30-day challenge series. Past challenges can be found [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/30daychallenges).

This month's 30-day challenge is to **Get involved with charity!** As the end of the year approaches, there are many opportunities to extend oneself to be generous. The best advice is to ""secure your own oxygen mask first"" before helping others. The foundation of your generosity should be a [solid financial footing for yourself](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/wiki/commontopics). Until you have achieved this, you should be circumspect about monetary giving.

# Monetary donations

If you have the means, consider monetary donations as these are the most efficient use of your charitable resources. Don't spend money to buy material goods that you intend to donate unless they are specifically requested by the charity itself. Cash donations allow for flexibility for the charity to get exactly what is needed at the right time in the right quantity at the right place to serve their mission.

Make sure you are contributing to charities that are good stewards of your hard-earned dollars by checking [Charity Navigator](https://www.charitynavigator.org/), [Give Well](https://www.givewell.org/), or another trusted source. If you do decide to donate cash, see if your employer matches contributions to extend the benefit. You may also consider donating to a charity that has assisted you or your loved ones in the past.

# Material donations

December is a great month in which to declutter your home, especially if you are participating in one of the many gift-giving holidays. Review your living space to determine what you can part with and how you can enjoy the reclaimed space. You can donate material goods to [Habitat for Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/), [Goodwill industries](https://www.goodwill.org/), [AmVets](http://amvets.org/), and local options near you such as food pantries.

# Time donations

Of course with all the donations coming in at this time of year, many organizations will need volunteers to help with the influx. If you are unable to donate money or material goods, you can consider donating your time. You can use [Volunteer Match](https://www.volunteermatch.org/) or [Catch a Fire](https://www.catchafire.org/) to get you started. There may also be local soup kitchens, churches, schools, or other organizations that need assistance.

# Alternative donations

There are other ways to be charitable if you don't have spare money, goods, or time. Here are some ideas:

* When making Amazon purchases, use the [Amazon smile program](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/chpf/about/ref=smi_se_dshb_aas_saas) to donate a portion of your purchase to a designated charity at no additional cost to you.
* Check with your local markets and grocers to see if they have programs such as [Kroger‚Äôs Community Rewards](https://www.kroger.com/topic/kroger-community-rewards-3) to direct donations to local charities.
* Keep an eye out for local restaurants and caf√©s that will donate a percentage of proceeds to charitable organizations, and patronize them during an eligible time period (schools are frequent beneficiaries of such programs).
* The [Make-a-wish foundation](http://wish.org/ways-to-help/giving/airline-miles), the [Red Cross](http://www.redcross.org/donations/ways-to-donate/donate-airline-miles), and [Miles for Migrants](https://www.miles4migrants.org/) all accept donations of airline miles.
* You may be able to donate hotel or resort points. Contact the relevant hospitality group for details.
* You can elect to donate credit card rewards to charity.
* If your health and personal philosophy allow, consider becoming a blood/plasma donor or [registering for bone marrow donation](https://bethematch.org/). You can also consider registering as an organ donor and revising your will to donate your body to research after you pass.

# Taxes

Qualified charitable contributions remain [tax-deductible under the new tax law in the US](https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/charitable-contributions/charitable-contributions/L6ZyAXJ4Y), but realizing a reduction in taxes is more difficult because of the increase in the standard deduction. If this is a significant factor for you, you may want to consider more advanced tax reduction strategies such as [donor advised funds](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/996iam/an_analysis_of_charitable_giving_using_donor/), [giving appreciated stock](https://www.philanthropy.com/article/Donors-Often-Overlook-Benefits/152705), or [bunching your donations](https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/itemize-bunching-tax-deductions.html) to meet the itemization threshold.

# Receiving charity

If you are in need this year, please consider being the good-faith recipient of a charity's assistance. 

# Challenge success criteria

You've successfully completed this challenge once you've done one of the following things:

* Donated money, goods, or time to a charity or organization.
* Made an alternative donation or plans to donate.
* Received charitable assistance if in need.",1701435602.0

My car is up for repo,21,188m6hz,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188m6hz/my_car_is_up_for_repo/,34,"Hello everyone, 

I‚Äôll start this by saying I know I am in a shitty situation and it‚Äôs me, myself and I that got me there. I realize that I have made horrible decisions that have now caught up to me, but I‚Äôm looking for the next best move. 

Basically I bought a 2018 Jeep Compass a couple of years ago. I recently lost my job (they removed my position entirely and are opening a new position, they told me to come back for the new role) and had two major deaths in my family that wiped out what little savings I had because I wasn‚Äôt making saving a priority. My car was 60 days past and I went to pay it but they said it had a repo pending and I‚Äôd need to pay $1100 to stop the repo. My car payment is $467 a month.

I was at the job for 10 years (I‚Äôm 28, started when I was 18). I am going back to the job for the newly created role. I can‚Äôt start until it opens which is December 22nd, but it‚Äôs a government job so I won‚Äôt be paid for the first time until mid January.  All of that is just backstory. 

My car will be repossessed before then. I have sold everything of value that I have and I have been door dashing and working my temp job that I got to cover bills while I waited for the new position but the insurance is about to lapse on my car. I‚Äôm slowly stacking the cash to pay the balance but it goes up to $1500 owed soon. 

What do I do? Do I voluntarily surrender it before they take it? A dealership has offered to look at it and put me in a ‚Äúcheaper car‚Äù but I‚Äôm worried that my negative equity will put the cheaper car at double its value or something. I desperately don‚Äôt want to make my bad situation even worse. I know I‚Äôve really gotten myself into a mess and accept full responsibility. I owe 26k and it‚Äôs worth 19k. I can‚Äôt get a loan for the difference because I‚Äôve been at the temp job for 2 months. My plan was to use savings to pay bills but I used that money for funeral expenses and now my plan is in shambles. I planned to work day and night to pay down the balance before it was taken but it‚Äôs looking like I‚Äôm going to cut it very close.

I‚Äôll take any advice even if you have to tear me apart. Please let me know what I should do from here. Thank you in advance if you read this far",1701464102.0

**TL;DR: I've racked up $77,314.87 in debt and need help with a strategy (totals at the bottom of the post).**

,While most parents prepare for their children to go off to college, mine were just focused on trying their best to keep the lights on. On paper they made money but the amount of debt from a failed business they had made it impossible for them to afford anything. I knew I wanted to further my education after high school but needed to figure out how I was going to pay for college. Ultimately I decided to go to community college. Although cheap, I still ended up having to utilize federal student loans to pay for my two years at school (once again, on paper my parents made money however, their debt-income ratio was just insane so I did not qualify for any FAFSA grants)

&#x200B;

**Poor Decision #1:** I knew I wanted to do healthcare at the time so the goal was to be a Physician‚Äôs Assistant. I was a Transfer major. After my two years I have no AS degree just vibes....

**Federal Loans acquired:**

$3,206.33  3.860%

$2,054.91 3.860%

$4,089.32 4.660%

$2,036.96 4.660%

*This is where ish hits the fan‚Ä¶*

**Poor Decision #2:** My parents separated (not legally separated..my dad just jumped ship). Too much stress and family drama. At the time I wanted to just get away from everything so I can focus on my education so I ended up enrolling in a university out of state. Tuition cost for an out-of-state student: $42,072.50.

**Federal Loans acquired:**

$4,068.62 4.290%

$5,886.26 4.450%

**Private Loan Amount:**32,847.50 4.74% (V)

*Looking at these numbers now makes my stomach turn but trust me it gets worse‚Ä¶.*

**Poor Decision #3:** The first year of college went great! I even made honors! However, it went downhill during my second year. I had no way of paying for school. Taking out a large loan was not an option this time around and once again no grants. I did win a $2,000 scholarship but that left me with 40000+ that I needed to come up with. I decided to take a year off and worked my ass off‚Ä¶managed to save $22,000 working three jobs 70hr+ weeks. Enrolled back into school the following year and made the dumbest decision and put my tuition on various credit cards. (I was 20 at the time, with no guidance and just trying whatever I could to make things work, I don‚Äôt think I fully grasped the severity of how much debt I was putting myself in at the time‚Ä¶I always convinced myself once I graduated it would be worth it and I would pay off all my debt)

Credit Card #1: 4,485.56 29.99% (V)

Credit Card #3: 5,561.43 25.05% (V)

Credit Card #4: $848.62 6.00% (V)

**Poor Decision #4:** The third year of school was a no-go I could not bear to put myself in any more academic debt. I dropped out of school and just focused on working to try and clean up my mess for the next few years. I  was carpooling with a coworker to my job. Their hours changed unfortunately and I was not able to get on the same schedule. I had a 6am start time with no public transportation routes to my job site. Uber/Lyfts were costing me \~$60 a day which was eating at my paycheck significantly. This was during the pandemic finding another job was damn near impossible but I was still trying! I took out a loan on a used vehicle 14,500 4.99%.

I am now (30F) and feel like I‚Äôm starting over. The past few years have been spent working trying my best to pay down my debt and it‚Äôs been a struggle. Feels like I‚Äôm getting nowhere. I would love to go back to school in the future and get an AS in Nursing or something stable where I can get a decent income coming in. But the prospect of that happening seems slim, especially with how much debt I am in. I wish I had better guidance when I was younger but my parents were to focused on their own lives to give a damn. It sucks, and I‚Äôve spent so much time being angry and sad at how much of a financial mess I am in. 

Ultimately I can‚Äôt blame anyone for my poor decisions, my main focus right now is paying off this debt. I‚Äôve moved in with family in an attempt to keep my cost of living low.I just accepted a job offer that will pay 48,000/yr and I am applying for part-time work. I also have a small business where I provide remote admin services to businesses and busy professionals (I only have 1 client right now so not much income coming in from this but hoping to build and land a few more clients). I also do my best to doordash whenever feasible.

If you were in my situation what would you do? Any advice is welcomed. I‚Äôm considering consolidating my credit debt but still researching if that‚Äôs the best way to go.

This seems like a case of identity theft but I'm struggling to understand how she could be frauded like this across multiple credit cards while she still has both in her possession and no new cards were issues under these accounts. More importantly, we don't really know how to proceed. Should she freeze her credit so no one can open new accounts under her name and just get all new cards?

Going through the flashback of my life, im extremely tired. I came from having my parents for a short time of my life for 8 years, then lived with my Aunt & Uncle who severely abused me. Being kicked out after I called the Police on my Uncle, then homeless with no where to go. Then couch surfing until im able to get back on my feet. Then, worked extremely hard for myself that i was able to share an apartment with a friend, to buying my own car, finally attending school since my Aunt & Uncle prevented me from doing so - Just to have my life crash again. 
It seems like im about to be back to square one. 
I am tired, stressed out, overwhelmed, exhausted, depressed, anxious and feel defeated by life itself that i dont even know why i am here for.
Growing up poor & homeless then living paycheck to paycheck was a step up for me. I got myself up including being enrolled to Cosmetology school what mattes to me which is being an Esthetician for lashes and brows so i can finally make more money for myself and not having to work for someone. I deserved it. I deserve happiness especially from my 24 years of going through so much trauma on my own that i deserve to atleast do something useful with my life to make sure i dont look back. 
Now being in school is the best thing that has ever happened to me, and now im currently having a hard time paying for my Car bill with my insurance coming up. Im about to be 2 months behind on my car bill that i may get it repo'd this week or early next week and i have nothing but less than a $1 in my account. 
I tried everything. I pawned. I donated plasma but my iron is a bit rocky because i am Anemic. Im selling things on offer up. Im on the waiting list for Instacart and Doordash, but funds wont come on time. I only work 2 days or if im lucky, 3 days due to being in school. I have nothing.

I should've listened to my dad and just bought a used car but that's in the past and I can't change it.

Anyway, the lease is up in January and I can't decide whether to buy out the car or turn it in and buy something used. The situation now is I'm married with an 11 month old and an 18 year old step daughter. My wife and I will likely have more kids but it's hard to plan because of a medical issue that may make that more difficult. If our family grew even by one more baby right now the Forester would be virtually unusable for us, we'd need some kind of vehicle with third row. But that's kind of a big variable to factor into the calculus.

So I'm weighing the possibility of turning in the car and just going out and buying a used minivan so we can be sure of the space. The problem is, if I turn in the car I'm surely going to incur some significant penalties because it's about 15K miles over the agreed mileage limit limit; there's some wear (our dog nearly chewed completely through the rear-middle seat belt) and I've lagged on maintenance (brakes and tires). I have a bit of money now that I would use to catch up on that maintenance and as a small down payment of sorts to finance the vehicle. I can get an 84 month loan from a local credit union for $25K at 7.9% interest which would bring the payments down to roughly $358/month, about 50 less than my current lease payments.

I make decent money (about $5,800/month take home) but much of it is spoken for with debt payments to my wife's and my various credit cards, student loans, and a debt consolidation loan. We're managing well so far, chipping away steadily at things but it would be nice to lower our car payment a little bit. Especially since we're a one-car family of three drivers and it'd be a big relief if we could afford to buy a cheap used car as a second vehicle (was looking at an 07 Corolla for $6K, as an example).

My question is, would it be more prudent to turn in the Subaru, just deal with the mileage and maintenance fines and go out and buy a used minivan to better fit my family or would it actually be more responsible to avoid the fines and keep the newer car?",1701388211.0

Since he possibly has cancer he is pretty determined to keep the houses and let his daughters and wife live in those houses when he dies. If this cancer ends up worse idk how they will survive since he is a sole provider for his wife. The daughter who lives in home 1 pays half rent and some of the other bills so it will affect her too. I just dont know if bankruptcy is a smart choice given how uncertain and unstable their medical diagnoses are. 

 I think BOB should sell home 2. He bought 2 years ago and could possibly gain 100k in profits to pay down some debt and consolidate the other or negotiate payments with no interest payments. He is expecting a bonus next year and always gets a tax refund that could help to minimize the rest and be debt free. 

BOB wants to file Ch13 he thinks it will protect the house and he doesn't want to sell HOME 2 and his friend told him he wouldnt have to pay the CC debt in a set amount of years.

Investment options in Argentina / non-US country,1,188rvqp,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188rvqp/investment_options_in_argentina_nonus_country/,1,"Hey everyone, here 28yrs living in Argentina. I'm working remotely and I  save almost all of my salary, which is around 5-6k each month. I'm currently building a house which costs me around 60k USD. For this, I used some pension money I reclaimed back from when I was living in Europe as I'm not interested in coming back. Almost all of those 60k are already invested, I'm missing about 4-5k but it's pretty much safe.  
 Now the deal for me is, how should I keep investing as my costs for living are currently quite low, last year I took a sabbatical and at most I was spending around 500USD a month and I could spend even less without sacrificing happiness. **My goal is to invest my money wisely to build wealth to later on be able to support my family, friends and the ones around me as much as possible (this is the most important part for me), + the increase of knowledge and wisdom to also share it with my community**.  


 One of the obstacles I have is that the money I get paid is through crypto, so investing options are quite limited. Are there crypto-safe investments? What options do I have? Plus, development of a business in Argentina is not a viable option as there are lots of problems and obstacles coming from the government.  
 One of the possible options for me was to keep purchasing land and invest here, but my knowledge of real-estate is quite low, I see in the area where I live quite a lot of growth though and a lot of possibilities as they're areas that are developing.

We were welcomed to home ownership with a frozen pipe (likely occurred before we even purchased the home, lying in wait) which flooded our downstairs bedroom. Cue a $15k insurance claim right off the bat.

There have been other issues too. Hardwood floors that weren't installed correctly and are wavy. A 3 story metal fire escape (common in my city) which developed a cracked structural beam. And now I'm in the middle of a major plumbing repair after the building water main sprung a leak in our kitchen ceiling (plumber said it was caused by corrosion due to using mixed metals). 

The building also has crumbling concrete in places, poorly designed HVAC which causes temperature variations, a garage that is too small for everyone to park in comfortably, a sump pump that died, sound isolation issues, a different ceiling leak from rain, a front gate out of alignment, fencing that is rusting, etc. It's just been a nightmare of one thing after another. It was built cheaply and poorly, and all the contractors we've had out have given the original construction a skeptical look or a raised eyebrow.

We had been planning to move in another 3 to 5 years after we had saved up some more money for an upgrade, but would it be crazy to move now/soon just to get out from under this place? Either a lateral move to a similar home, or just go back to renting for a few years?

Forgotten bill in another country....,0,188r9k2,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188r9k2/forgotten_bill_in_another_country/,0,"Probably a silly question....

So, in 2021 I studied abroad in Spain. Long story short I was very ill during for more than half of the duration. I had acute gastritis and inflammation of my esophagus that made me extremely short of breath, among other issues.

In the first few weeks when I was basically bedridden, I asked the program administrators if there was any kind of virtual therapy I could attend. They said yes, signed me up for a virtual therapy appointment. I went to the appointment, it wasn't really for me, I did not schedule a follow up appointment and focused on getting healthier physically.

A few weeks later the program emails me to let me know it will be a $100 bill for the session. Sounds reasonable. This is lower than the deductible for my temp GeoBlue study abroad health insurance, so I have to pay out of pocket. I go into the patient portal and try to pay, but I find out there is no way for me to pay online. I contact the program about this, and they say I have to call to pay by credit card or walk there in person.

Well..... I said, I'll deal with that later, I can barely manage calls, much less long walks!! Fast forward a month and I'm on my way home (I was only in the country for two months total), I spend the next few months getting my mental and physical health in order over the summer and moving to a new place.... Totally forgot about the bill. I only remembered it months later when I was recounting the tales of my terrible trip and mentioned the therapy appointment... Oh shit, I thought. I guess it doesn't matter now, if they really want the money they can call me about it.

Anyway. Now I am traveling to Spain for a trip in March, and I'm irrationally afraid some kind of collections authority is going to come charging at me in the airport because of my unpaid bill!!! Wondering what my best course of action is here. Do you think everyone has totally forgotten about this? Maybe the program covered the bill after I left? Or do you think I still need to pay it (morally? ethically?)? If I call the therapy center / hospital will they even know what I'm talking about??? Nobody has ever emailed me or called me or followed up about the unpaid $100 this whole time. I don't even remember the name of the center, although I'm sure it's in my old student email somewhere.

I know the typical advice would be to pay down the debt first, but it seems to me that contributing to the IRA first makes sense here:  


1. I'd save about $700 on taxes, which I would then put towards the 10% debt when I receive tax refund
2. I wouldn't miss out on the option of maxing out 2023 IRA contributions (I'll likely be able to max 2024 regardless. 
3. I should have enough of a tax refund in a few months to mostly pay off the 10% debt anyway (in addition to the $700). And I don't think I can do the opposite (pay off debt now and use refund to max out IRA), since I would need to claim  IRA contributions at tax time.

We have purchased a home, paid off vehicles, have established credit. I am obviously irritated that my credit took a hit from collections but it's still decent.

Questions I have regarding debt collections: 

They have contacted me a little over a week ago but only left a voicemail as I did not recognize the number. Does this count as initial contact or do they have to actually speak with me for it to be initial contact?

I have not received a debt validation letter from them. I know that by law they need to send it within 5 days of the initial contact. Does violating this invalidate the debt owed?

I plan to send a debt verification letter to the collections agency. If they fail to respond within the required 30 days does this invalidate the debt owed?

What are the implications of filing a 1099 for a summer nanny?,1,188pg58,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188pg58/what_are_the_implications_of_filing_a_1099_for_a/,21,"So this summer my neighbor's daughter did some work helping us manage child activities over this summer months. It was loosely like nanny work but the reality of it is the job was mostly get the kids where they needed to be in the morning pick them up in the afternoon and maybe occasionally watch them andhang out with them for a few hours. Not a full-time gig or a primary career by any means, just a summer gig that was some babysitting and chauffeuring. 

Anyway my neighbor wants me to file a 1099 for the work his daughter did over the summer. Apparently he wants to start a Roth or an IRA or something and the contribution can't be greater than the money she can prove she's earned. 

I'm happy to do this if it helps him out I just want to make sure that I'm not going to open a world of trouble for myself. From my perspective since she's a student and this wasn't her career I don't have to file a 1099, so what are the implications of me doing so? I just don't want to become an ""employer"" and suddenly find out I needed to pay into social security or provide them benefits or that I'm going to have fines or penalties levied against me because I didn't do certain things. 

So is it an issue for me to file a 1099 for a summertime babysitter? Am I going to cause myself a lot of headache or is this a nothing Burger?",1701472728.0

It has both pre-tax and Roth contributions, that I want to transfer to a Rollover IRA and a Roth IRA respectively. I was under the impression there weren't any tax implications to those types of rollovers, but I had the following conversation with the chat agent helping me:

>HER: Rolling over to both a Roth IRA and Traditional IRA, you will also need 2 different forms. Also, please keep in mind that any growth on your Roth funds here that are rolling over into the Roth IRA will be a taxable event and taxes will be withheld on the growth only at a federal rate of 20%, unless you elect to opt-out and pay the taxes when you file.

>ME: A Roth-to-Roth transfer would be a taxable event? That doesn't sound correct.

>HER: Sorry for the confusion, I said any growth that has occurred on the Roth funds here will be taxable. This is not a Roth IRA, this is a Roth 403(b). The tax rules are slightly different, there is unfortunately no way to avoid the growth on the Roth 403(b) funds being taxed because that growth has grown tax deferred. In a Roth IRA, the growth would be tax free after holding the Roth IRA for 5 years AND reaching the age of 59.5, but the Roth 403(b) does not follow the same rules.

I'm trying to understand the disconnect. I can't find much to back up what she told me, but the information on this is a little arcane. Can somebody help me understand whether she's correct, and if so, what I might be missing?",1701471446.0

IRA Rollover to 401k with post tax money,1,188nu1y,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188nu1y/ira_rollover_to_401k_with_post_tax_money/,2,"Hi All,

I have a Traditional IRA with about $52k in it stemming from a 401k rollover and some contribution years where I did not have a 401k available to me. I recently started a new job with a 401k that allows for a rollover from a Traditional IRA that I would like to do so that I can start taking advantage of the backdoor Roth. 

The process of the rollover is pretty straightforward but where I have a bit of confusion is that this Traditional IRA contains a $6,000 contribution of post tax money. That stemmed from a large unexpected bonus one year that took me over the income limit and I frankly wasn't as privy to pro-rata and the mixing of pre and post money in an IRA. 

My question is: Can I simply rollover $46k into my new 401k and then convert the $6k of post tax contribution to a new Roth IRA? Do I need to take into account pro-rata during this rollover and conversion?

Large Medical Bill/Insurance Coverage,1,188ntmd,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188ntmd/large_medical_billinsurance_coverage/,5,"Hello all -

Long story short and to keep this anonymous, my wife and I had a son born at the end of October and unfortunately passed a few days into November at 10 days old. He was born with a rare terminal genetic disorder that we weren‚Äôt aware of until after birth and it took about 8 days in the hospital to diagnose the disorder. They kept him alive with many machines but his body began shutting down shortly after receiving his diagnosis and we ultimately decided to take him off and let him pass peacefully. It‚Äôs been extremely hard but we are healing with time. 

The reason for this post is my concerns with the medical bills to come of this. With the disorder being extremely rare and the doctors going to extreme measures to keep our son alive, the bills are enormous. Prior to our son being born, we had basically hit our family deductible for the year and our out of pocket max is $8,000. The first course of bills have been processed by our insurance company amounting to about $50k and all but about $1,400 wasn‚Äôt covered (most likely some of our deductible). There is another $500k+ ‚Äúprocessing‚Äù and I have no clue what to make of it. I know the insurance company is negotiating before agreeing to pay/not pay the remaining bill, but just knowing it‚Äôs looming around can make you go crazy thinking about.

Allocations within Inherited IRA?,3,188f4cg,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188f4cg/allocations_within_inherited_ira/,7,"Hello, personal finance sub. I have some questions for those of you who are familiar with inherited IRAs.

My father recently passed, leaving my brothers and I as beneficiaries on multiple retirement accounts. A few of those accounts are currently being managed by Equitable. My dad had a FA who gets some sort of cut of the earnings. My share of the accounts (there are four with this one brokerage) will be ~100k. 

I have read enough on here to know to dump the FA after he sets up the inherited accounts and do a TOA of the funds to a new brokerage (already talked to Fidelity and have those accounts set up to go on that end). 

This is totally new territory for me and I had a couple points of confusion:

1. The FA called me to ask how I want the funds allocated within the inherited IRA he is setting up for me. He said putting it all in a money market was a low risk option. Does that sound like a safe move until I am able to move the funds to Fidelity and reallocate?

2. My lawyer told me to wait 30 days after the initial inherited IRAs are set up to ask Fidelity to initiate the TOA. Is there any reason to wait that long? She told me it was to make sure the accounts were set up correctly but that didn‚Äôt really make sense to me.

The annual cycle of my FSA and insurance is in the summer as opposed to the calendar year. I still have some remaining medical expenses that have not been paid yet, and I have been trying to get on a payment plan, so that I could potentially pay it in the future when I can add more money in my FSA account (I know for sure I will not have reached my out of pocket max by the end of the fiscal year). However, if I cannot get on a payment plan, are there any tax-advantage methods of paying the rest of my healthcare expense that are available?

I was issued some RSUs at my company when the stock was at an all time high ($90). It has since plummeted and has been worth less than half of what I came on at. I've thus been holding onto it (I am usually of the belief that you should immediately sell RSUs.). The stock is now at a 1 year high today ($56) and a portion is subject to long term capital gains in March. Should I sell a portion that is recently vested?

EDIT: I should add a little more detail here. My employer requires ""sell to cover"" which I believe is taxed at 22%. I am in the 32% tax bracket. My understanding is that I am liable for that additional 10% if I sell short-term. If I hold onto it for a year I have no additional tax liability. Am I understanding that correctly?",1701449329.0

Seeking Guidance on Consolidating Substantial Credit Card Debt and Lowering Interest Rates,1,188la2b,personalfinance,https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/188la2b/seeking_guidance_on_consolidating_substantial/,6,"$35,000 in credit card debt, accumulated across multiple cards (Chase, Citi, Amex, Capital One, and Barclays) after intro APR offers expired.

I‚Äôm seeking advice on consolidating debt and lowering interest rates, without further harming my credit score, which went from 740 to 570 (due to utilization).

Background:

- The debt arose from an unavoidable emergency purchase, and I don‚Äôt really regret it. I don‚Äôt have a spending problem. My rent is low, home-cooked meals, a cash-purchased car, and I have fun on the cheap. 

- My only valuable asset is a 2017 Mazda, which obviously depreciates in value. I'm also expecting a $3,000 tax refund.

- Adding a line of credit from someone else temporarily reduced my utilization to around 30%, but surprisingly had NO impact on my credit score. :-/

- Amex offers a financial relief program that would lower my interest rate to 7%, providing great relief. 
Curious if other banks offer similar, and your experiences with it. Did it impact your credit score or ability to consolidate in the future? 

I'm also curious what might happen if I just ask my banks to lower the rate, without entering an official program.



The exorbitant interest rates (27-30%) are severely impacting my finances. My expendable income is just enough to cover the minimum payments (around 1k). With the high interest, my payment  obviously does little to reduce the total balance. 

I'm seeking suggestions on lowering my interest rates or tackling this debt creatively, beyond merely increasing my income, which I'm already actively pursuing. Any other advice is welcome",1701461756.0

Rules for option trading on different platforms,0,188pe6u,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/188pe6u/rules_for_option_trading_on_different_platforms/,3,"#options
Hello. I am new to options trading. I registered for Interactive brokers. I started with 2500 and cash account. But I want to try to short option calls and puts. So there are the questions:

1. To short options I need to have only margin account?

2. I want to execute several trades ( daytrading) and afraid of pdt rule. To avoid pdt I need to have 25k on balance. So if e.g  I started from 25K and end then loose some trades and balance would be 24 - that mean that pdt rule is applicable again to my account?

Here's a Breakdown of My Recent Strategy - SPX Long Strangle Plays,8,188a1xt,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/188a1xt/heres_a_breakdown_of_my_recent_strategy_spx_long/,24,"Here's a breakdown of my recent strategy: during afterhours trading sessions, I initiate a long Strangle on SPX around a 5-10 delta, with each leg costing $1.00. By purchasing Calls at $1.00 and Puts at $1.00, I close the Calls for $1.50 and the Puts for $0.65 after just a 6-point move up on ES, resulting in a $0.15 profit (+7.5%).

The core concept is to open a SPX Long Strangle daily, aiming to close the position for a 5-10% gain after an ES move - whether up or down - as long as it experiences some movement.

Today, I experimented with an ATM Strangle, with contracts averaging $19.30 and closing for $19.70 after a 7-point ES move, resulting in a profit of $0.40 (+2%). However, it appears the losing leg incurred more losses compared to the far OTM position. While ATM trades are preferable for commissions and fees, the OTM trades are way more effective, read further below.

I kept an eye on the OTM contracts ‚Äì they would have yielded a much better result. After a 10-point move up, the calls, bought for $1.15, were at $2.30, and the puts, bought for $1.10, were at $0.50, resulting in a potential profit of $0.55 (+24%).

&#x200B;

To illustrate the impact, let's use a $16,000 account:

\- \*ATM Position:\*

Open for $19.30 x 8 contracts = $15,440

Close for $19.70 x 8 contracts = $15,760

$0.40 x 8 contracts = $320 Profit

&#x200B;

\- \*OTM Position:\*

Open for $2.25 x 69 contracts = $15,525

Close for $2.80 x 69 contracts = $15,760

$0.55 x 69 contracts = $3,795 Profit

&#x200B;

Even after accounting for commissions and fees, the OTM position proves to be remarkably more profitable vs the ATM position.

A couple of notes: Initiating these trades during extended hours and on news days has proven beneficial, capitalizing on the increasing IV throughout the day. However, it's crucial to close positions before news releases as IV will crush your ass if price does not rocket or melt.

I‚Äôd appreciate insights and discussions on refining this strategy.",1701431578.0

Not to mention millions in fines and merger costs paid for by the SPAC kitty.

There's a decent chance I think the SEC calls the whole thing off because they didn't even try to hide the grift.

the whale is trying to cash out the profit if addition is included and stock soars;

the whale is trying to short the stock if addition fails, while the entire synthetic short positions expressed by short ITM call/long OTM put is a credit trade to cushion the loss if wrong.

Why profitable strategies on paper will never work in real trading? Answered,1,18837e6,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/18837e6/why_profitable_strategies_on_paper_will_never/,1,"Me and my trading fellow trade for 7-8 years. Most of it on options. We achieve with couple strategies consistent 20%+ return and we have been through many strategies and I notice one common thing.

Backtested strategies will never work and here is why.

In trading view there are plenty if not thousands public strategies - as soon as you apply in real trading you‚Äôll lose.

Main factor why strategies are loosing is SLIPPAGE. And slippage can‚Äôt be set as fixed. Even if you apply enough average slippage you‚Äôll notice that majority of strategies are losing.

How and why?

Market slippage actually very well represents how inefficient your strategy in applied market reality. Signals that you are trying to trade are already picked up by HFT models, they are very quick and trade against them is a complete disaster.

Back look on chart, well I could enter here and close here, here and close there etc.

No, you couldn‚Äôt. Cause market is dynamic and there is no such a strategy that could be fit in all aspects. Patterns almost don‚Äôt repeat and even if they are - slippage will kill your strategy.

What really made good money for us - unusual entries and unusual exits.

Basic concepts of overbought and oversold are not changed but they are uniq for us, not by RSI or MACD - it‚Äôs public signals that will never make profit because of slippage.

As of today we still use semi automatic strategies cause it requires to make unusual manual entry.

If you have a strategy where market pays for your slippage - that is the winner.

If you pay for slippage - signal is too late and you were slippage discount for someone else.",1701405829.0

Efficient Process to Create an Option Strategy,0,18809el,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/18809el/efficient_process_to_create_an_option_strategy/,21,"Tl;Dr. Creating a general process to efficiently test the validity of an option strategy will save us time and money. I've found that a 5 step process works really well: 1. Outline the strategy, 2. backtest / forward test; 3. papertrade; 4. test deploy; 5. scale. 

The goal of this post is to share how I approached creating option strategies to hopefully give newer traders some ideas on how they can create their own. To help outline the process, I'll use an example.

* 1. Outlined the Strategy.
   * I start with what I'm trying to accomplish and what I think the perceived edge is for a given strategy. In this case, I will use weekend decay. 
   * Hypothesis: we know we can accelerate the returns for short premium strategies by expanding our holdings during non-trading market periods. Holidays and weekends offer opportunities to gain exposure. This strategy will focus on the weekend effect but applies to holiday periods as well.
   * Researching hypothesis: 
      * First, we can explore research that's already been conducted on this effect to more efficiently research it. 
      * Connolly, R. A. 1989. An examination of the robustness of the Weekend Effect. Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis 24 (2)
      * Keim, D. B., and R. F. Stambaugh. 1984. A further investigation of the Weekend Effect in stock returns. 
      * Lakonishok, J., and E. Maberly. 1990. The Weekend Effect: Trading patterns of individual and institutional investors. 
      * Schwert. 2002. Anomalies and Market Efficiency
   * Testing hypothesis:
      * Now that I know there's efficacy behind this hypothesis, I need to think of how I want to trade it. To take advantage of the average mispricing of IV leading into and through the weekend, I will look at short premium strategies that look at variance risk premiums vs directional strategies. 
      * I will explore short straddles, short strangles, short iron flys, and short iron condors. 
      * I need to outline the key variables I want to consider: I will use the nearest expiration after the weekend and will enter Fridays before the close (need to test time to enter). I need to test if I want to take to expiration, or exit early. I need to test what deltas perform the best. I also want to see if VIX has any impact on profitability. Finally, how will I manage losing trades? 
* 2. Backtesting:
   * After reviewing this various permutations, I test a large timeframe (15 years) for an initial look then zoom in to more recent data to assess if it's still viable using the following timeframes (2019-2023 YTD). Parsing through the prelim data, I find that Iron Condors perform the best for my needs (although they are not the highest returning). I found that the optimal entry time is 1230 (PT)
   * From there, want to understand what width performs the best and I find the wider spread in general performs best 30 delta shorts, 5 delta longs

* 3. Papertrade. This is where I will assess the efficacy of the best performing structures to explore how I would actually trade it. I also use paper trading to create a dataset so I can continue to evaluate what variations perform the best, markets move. I've already paper traded this phenomenon ad nauseum and continue to do so to review various permutations. It remains efficacious. 
* 4. Test deploy. This is where I will test the smallest size possible, typically at least 4 months to see how it performs, how I react, and to finalize the remaining details. 
* 5. Scale. Below are the results of the strategy (I've traded this for years but I'm sharing 2023 results)
   * I run the trade using 5lots. There is some variance from the backtest results which I imagine is no surprise to anyone here. Real trading isn't the same as back testing.

Long Term Investor Looking to understand Option Strategies,13,18733b1,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/18733b1/long_term_investor_looking_to_understand_option/,34,"I am a long term investor minded person and therefore only buy thinks like QQQ, VFV, XEQT and these hold about 90% of my investments. I have a relatively good job and have been able to amass about $600k in investment value and save about $10K a month. 

I am looking to set my 2024 goals and one of them is to gain a better understanding of options. I understand the basics like buying/selling a put/call but how to interlock them together and work together is what I want to spend 2024 learning and decide if this is something I want to incorporate into my investment strategy or not. 

As I was learning, one of the things I have been pondering is why don't I just write far out of the money call options on one of indexes like QQQM. 100 shares of QQQM = \~16K which I currently own so I would be reducing my risk by not selling a naked call. I would then look for a strike price that is like 2-3 std deviations (like 20% increase in 30days) which would then further reduce my risk.  All that reduction in risk will basically mean that my returns will be quite low but so what? I  effectively take no risk and if the market does go +20% in 30 days I probably would've wanted to cash out anyway despite the fact I just always end up holding lol 

I would be looking to practice this by paper trading first for 6mnths and do some research on which indexs this would be a good strategy on.

Is this something that is common? If so how is it going for you?

I work for a mid sized prop trading firm, we have a successful MM business and looking to compliment it with an Options desk.   
We have experience within the firm to understand how an Options business works, have done our due diligence on the opportunity size and have engineers with Options experience who can lead the tech build out.

For our engineering / quant / research hiring we use a combination of GMA testing, behavioural interviews and work samples, flexing the exact combination depending on the seniority of the candidate. 

I've read a number of threads here and in other groups about interviewing but understandably they all seem to focus on entry level or junior hiring.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-12-01.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",1701097511.0

The blog posts I shared were showing real options trading strategies with analysis around them and contained all the necessary details to execute them. For reference, both were well received at /r/thetagang.   Both of them were banned here as ""Self promotion"". I don't feel it's fair.

In other hand /u/esInvests frequently posts meaningless sh\*t. It's trivial that he is promoting his youtube channel here with very low options content.

What's your opinion?

"Expected moves this week: VERY low IV in SPY/SPX, earnings from Salesforce, Crowdstrike and more.",13,184lkd7,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/184lkd7/expected_moves_this_week_very_low_iv_in_spyspx/,6,"SPY/SPX was higher by about 1% in holiday-shortened trading last week, slightly more than what options were pricing. The gamma we've discussed in these posts that held SPX near the 4500 level mostly expired after Nov monthly expiration the week before but the Thanksgiving week saw low volumes and not a ton of volatility to give an indication of what type of option backdrop we'll see over the next few weeks. If we were to see some volatility before year end it would most likely come in the next two weeks while the gamma forces are not as significant, and, there's a decent amount of economic data and Fedspeak.

Implied Vol is VERY low across the board. The VIX closed Friday near 12.50. At the money IV in SPY/SPX is below 10 for several days this week. The VIX has been a straight line down from 22 in late October. As discussed previously that can have a self-fulfilling crush on both implied vol AND realized vol, loading the market up with gamma while market makers drastically lower option bids across the board to stop drowning in long premium. Those conditions often lead to a slow creep higher where the risk on option selling each day is to the upside with expected moves so narrow. The conditions would most likely flip with an accelerating sell-off in stocks where investors finally looked to buy protection again. Whether that occurs in any way this week or next remains to be seen. If it does not we then re-enter a holiday period at year-end and a December expiry that could once again be loaded with gamma. Before now and then there are this week's GDP, PCE and a Powell Speech. Next week is an important Jobs Number, and after that is CPI. So some things to watch for on the calendar.

Earnings season is coming to an end but some interesting names remain. This week sees Crowdstrike, Salesforce, Snowflake and a few others.

* Do people use models to predict the hidden standard deviation like time series and stuff like that?
* What makes you think you can estimate volatility better than the market, whose collective pricing determines IV.
* What happens if I just use the IV value? Would I make less money, would my bets even out in the long run making no money?
* More generally, someone said in my previous thread the field is adversarial and to a good degree it is a zero sum game. I think this is why the discussions, tools and available information tend to be a bit vague.",1701035905.0

Are there any brokers who allow you to set a buy or sale of options based on the price of the underlying?

Example: I want to sell a call on SPY with a strike of $440, but I only want to do it when SPY falls below $435 and I don‚Äôt care about the premium. I just want to sell a call OTM at a specific strike in an effort to expire worthless.

Is this a dumb buy and sell order type? I know you‚Äôre shooting for a questionable cost basis by doing this but if you‚Äôre looking to shoot for a top or bottom underlying value point then this seems like the only way to set a catch.

For clarity, SPY and those numbers are just used as an example and do not reflect actual intent.

Vix straddle strategy,0,184a10j,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/184a10j/vix_straddle_strategy/,13,"Hey all, I‚Äôm currently using this strategy with VIX options and am making around 20k per month from this.
 
I would love for someone to tell me what I am not seeing or if I have any blindspots here.
 
 
The outline to the strategy goes like this 
 
‚Ä¢       The strategy is 3-fold . 
‚Ä¢       Sell puts 
‚Ä¢       sell calls and 
‚Ä¢       buy protection (insurance) on the calls side
 
Trade 1 ‚Äì sold put 
‚Ä¢       From this we:
-       Gain revenue ‚Äì money comes into our account; this is a one-time payment, and we use the revenue from this trade to purchase the insurance. (I‚Äôll explain this later)
-       The way this works is if the market goes down, then the VIX spikes up, which is good for this position and provides a protective element for the account. 
-       The reverse is the case when the market goes up.
Summary of this part of the trade:
-       We gain revenue from this trade as a one-time payment, we use the revenue to purchase insurance and it also protects our account when the market falls
-       So essentially, when the market goes down, this trade has a protective element on the account.
 
 
Second trade ‚Äì Selling a call
 
‚Ä¢       From this we:
-       Gain revenue ‚Äì money comes into our account. 
-       This works in the reverse way to the sold put. When the market drops the VIX moves up which is negative for our account
o   However, this is offset by the sold put.
Summary of this part of the trade:
-       We gain revenue from this trade; we can make good money on this when the VIX is in a range from $10-$25
-       This is a recurring month to month revenue for the account.
 
 
Third trade ‚Äì buying a call
 
From this we:
-       This trade costs money but is funded by the sold put (1st trade) 
-       This is essentially us buying insurance against a big move. 
-       This is a one-time cost
-       So, trade 2 allow us to make great money month to month and this bought call (trade 3) or insurance protects us against catastrophic damage to the stock market. 
 
 
Summary
-       Trade 1 ‚Äì revenue comes in ‚Äì we use it to fund trade 3
-       Trade 2 - allows us to make great money month to month 
-       Trade 3 - this bought call or insurance protects us against catastrophic damage to the stock market.  (E.g GFC / Covid etc)
 
‚Ä¢       So essentially, we are playing both sides or straddling the market. 
‚Ä¢       So, if the market goes down ‚Äì its good
‚Ä¢       If the market goes up ‚Äì good
‚Ä¢       If the market goes down dramatically, our insurance kicks in and protects the account and places a backstop on the account. 
‚Ä¢       If the market goes up dramatically, the VIX has a floor of about 12, so we have a backstop there as well 
Having this safeguard allows us to take on more risk, not less because we have a backstop and insurance place",1701003000.0
Addy's Trading Insight,3,183x6sc,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/183x6sc/addys_trading_insight/,8,"Hey everyone, I am Addy and this is my first-ever post on Reddit. I have been trading short options for 7 years and have decided to share my rationale/thought process about a trade I recently put on. I primarily trade options on futures so here's a short video of my trade explaining everything.

Please let me know if you have any comments feedback or questions about the technicalities of the trade. Always open to criticism/suggestions and happy to extend the olive branch about trading short options.

I sold the put credit spread for 9 ticks and each tick in the /ZB market is $15.625

Max Profit = Net premium Collected minus Commissions

Commissions Paid = $4.50 + $1.74 = $6.24 (to open the trade, there will be another $6.24 to close, fyi)

Max Potential Profit = $140.63 - $6.24 = $134.39 (At open)

Buying Power effect = approximately $350 (this is how much money i have put down to initiate the position)

ROI = I look at the cash I put down and the actual $ I collect after paying all commissions, to open and close.

So if my net P&L is up by approx. $85-$100, I will look to close it as that will give me roughly 45-50% profit of max premium, after commissions.

Here is the actual trade.

VIX options strategy,34,1820f4j,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1820f4j/vix_options_strategy/,135,"Hi all

Just want to run my VIX options strategy by the option experts.

So - I did some stats and found out that 80% of the time the VIX has been between 14 and 25 (over the time span that the VIX is available).

So, if I sell cash secured calls with strikes = 25 and cash secured puts = 14 (if available), I have a 80% chance to close the deal in my favor.

So, what is with the risks:

* Spike crash (happens from time to time) --> VIX can go up to almost 90
* Regular crash (we all know) - VIX will be between 25-40 for 2-3 months
* Period with Vola > 25 of > 3 months --> happened from 2008-2009
* Periods with Vola < 14

How to hedge:

*  In any case a bear call hedge, i.e. selling a call at Strike = 25 and buying a call at 50, which will leave me with a risk of 25 --> so I need $2500 per trade in cash to be called cash secured, i.e. with a portfolio of 100k I could open 40 positions of that risk profile
* I am experimenting with additional hedging like Long Calls/ Puts on the UVXY but this would be the topic of a different threat. 

My experience so far (over a few months)

* The difficulty of cause is if you need to roll in case your Short Call is ITM. However, this can be done w/o too much of a loss.
* Annual win rate is 20-35% p.a.

How to profit when the market goes down?,1,1820t4z,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/1820t4z/how_to_profit_when_the_market_goes_down/,19," Hi all

I am basically only trading options on VIX, VSTOXX and ETFs that relate to these indices.

I did some thinking and experimenting on how to profit (not to hedge) from a crash that will be associated with a significant increase in volatility.

Ideas No. 1:

* Buy a number (let's say 20) of ATM calls of the UVXY when volatility is low. Expiration date should be 6-9 months
* How to finance this:  

   * Sell ATM calls on UVXY with an expiration date for the end of the week, i.e. ideally the calls would expire worthless (or I set a take profit at 90% of the maximally possible profit) and I would sell new ones in a weekly frequency.
   * I set a stop loss at 200% of the received premium --> purpose: In case of a crash, I would be stopped out and could gain from an increased UVXY raise.

The problems that I see:

* If I am stopped out too often I will not be able to make this self-sufficient
* The inherent decline of the UVXY price  

   * After 12 months the UVXY should be declined by 90%. So if I buy the UVXY at 10, it should be worth only 1 after 12 months. This means, if the UVXY spikes at that later end, I will not gain much. So I have to roll, but when? After 3 months? After 6?",1700744788.0

I'm evaluating some ideas to limit my losses, which are steep. Since I'm pretty new to this, I would appreciate help in making sure my  thinking is correct and getting feedback on my next move.

I paid around $2100 for a DEC 15/520C on NVDA, which as of right now, is down about $1500 (yikes). After the steep IV crush/stock tanking after earnings, all of the OTM calls have taken a hit. With that in mind... can I use this to my advantage?

‚Ä¶Right now, the DEC 15/**500**C is worth about $1150, and I can roll the call down (yes, realizing the loss, I get that) for a debit of about $550. Doing the math:

* Total spend: **2650** (cost of the original call + debit for rolling)
* (Minus) New call value: **1150**
* (Equals) Total loss: **1500** \--- the same amount I'm already down!! But I've greatly increased my odds of the position turning around... right??

Am I missing anything here, or could this be a viable move? Obviously, I'm doubling down on my bet, and could still lose it all... What do y'all think, does this idea have merit? (Edit: being more specific, is my math/logic correct??)

Combining the just one more paradox with the Black Scholes model for credit/debit spreads,25,180os9j,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/180os9j/combining_the_just_one_more_paradox_with_the/,32,"[Just One More Paradox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_FuuYSM7yOo&lc=Ugz2fNK8i0zeVR9IoTB4AaABAg.9oz-i6N9wSo9oz3jbv-xNK)

[Black Scholes Model](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/blackscholes.asp)

Let S be the stock price of ticker X, N be a strike price, and T be the time

Let P(S>N|T) be the probability that a particular ticker will be above a particular strike price given time T, which is calculated using the Black Scholes model.

Now lets discuss the spread, Ill stick to put credit spreads so we want them to expire above the strike price of the top of the ladder:

let p be the max profit of the spread, and s be the size of the spread, such that the ratio r gain is calculated by p/(s-p), eg is we have a $0.2 sell, and the size of the spread is $1.00, our risk is $0.80.

Thus our reward for every dollar on the spread is 25%. (calculated by 0.2/0.8, or 1/4) so for every dollar we bet we potentially gain 25% on the trade.

Let g be the potential gain (in percentage) and l be the potential loss if we were to bet some amount:

if P(S>N|T)g - P(S<=N|T)l > 0, it is considered a good play.

given that last calculation I have seen 1 time where it was a good play, but that was after hours.

My NVDA Earnings Play: Neutral Stance with a Focus on IV Drop,15,180nbel,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/180nbel/my_nvda_earnings_play_neutral_stance_with_a_focus/,18,"I'm expecting a strong report from NVDA. Under such circumstances I usually open ratio calls, especially when the stock is at highs, but this time I chose not to take that risk.

Instead, I've opened a relatively neutral position, but with strong negative vega, anticipating a drop in IV post-earnings report:

* Bought 3 Dec15 Puts at $500
* Sold 12 Dec15 Puts at $450
* Bought 6 Nov24 Puts at $465
* Bought 1 Dec15 Call at $540
* Sold 1 Nov24 Call at $560
* Debit: $2567. Collateral: $30000.

After a positive earnings report, I'm expecting a drop below $500 and aim to profit from the Dec15 $500 Puts. Still, just in case, I bought the Dec15 $540 Call as a hedge against a surprisingly strong report. I'll decide what to do with the short $560 call based on market reaction.

As a safety measure, I also bought 6 Nov24 $465 Puts. While I don‚Äôt strongly anticipate an unpleasant surprise, the significant rise in November could still lead to severe disappointments.

UPD1: My expectations for a strong NVIDIA (NVDA) report were mostly met, but I anticipated the market's downturn to happen a bit later. Nevertheless, it's not a big issue. As expected, the implied volatility (IV) in December options plummeted, and my position is holding up well. However, I can't boast about profits yet because the Nov24 puts I had as a hedge against any sudden negative surprises also became worthless.

Just before yesterday's report, I decided to hedge a bit against a minor decline by buying a Dec15 Straddle at $540, selling 2 Dec15 Puts at $460, and 3 Dec15 Calls at $630, costing me an additional $3828.

So, in total, the position's debit stands at $6395.

I'm not a fan of such situations, but I'm banking on the stock correcting itself in the next 2-3 weeks, along with the broader market ‚Äì I'm still holding some¬†SOXS¬†and¬†SQQQ.

UPD2: I've closed my position in NVDA's Dec15 options. Some of the bought puts expired OTM on Nov 24th, but this didn't prevent me from achieving a credit of $8367 upon closing yesterday. In total, that's a profit of $1972 minus a commission of $81.64.

I was asked why I opened such a 'complex' position when my main aim was the IV crush? Wouldn't it have been simpler to sell a strangle? For instance, the same Dec15 Puts 450 and Dec15 Calls 540?

Yes, it would have been simpler. And it might even have been more profitable. However, the profitability is debatable.

I wouldn't have dared to sell that volume of puts without at least partial insurance. And selling naked calls on NVDA before the earnings report, I consider downright reckless.

With my approach I was prepared for any scenario, and I was likely to secure my $1.5-2k profit regardless.

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-11-24.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

- **E.R.:** Days unitl the next Earnings Release. This feature is still in beta as we work on a more complete list of earnings dates.

- **Why isn't my stock on this list?** It doesn't have ""weeklies"", the underlying is ""too cheap"", or the options markets are too illiquid (open interest) to qualify for this strategy. 480 underlyings are used in this report and only the top results end up passing the criteria for each filter.",1700492710.0
sell covered puts on QQQ,4,17zrz0m,options,https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/17zrz0m/sell_covered_puts_on_qqq/,19,"Hello all, after years on trying to have a good strategy of making money with options (and I tried everything btw) I am at a simple strategy that is working for me. I started about two months ago, went through a horrible period where I sticked to my strategy and it is doing ok right now (not get rich quick but I am making money). It works like this: I am just selling daily OTM puts with about 0.75 delta (which is about two dollars below market) in the morning and close 10 minutes before market close if they are about to expire worthless (I was rolling to the following day but I realized that after closing, since there is low volume, whales were manipulating the price so I stopped rolling). If they become ITM I roll them to deltas of 0.25 from market (depending the drop, of course), eventually it recovers and I am back in the game making money (It worked last month on the brutal drop). Here are my questions:

1. I have a hard time entering the trade, I want to have a consistent metric (easier said than done... I know), like RSA or Volume... or something, not just saying... NOW!!!  any ideas? I know it needs to be before 10 am so that the volatility inflates the premiums.
2. What is your take into rolling, sometimes the whales bring the price up so that the calls expire worthless and sometimes they drop it for the puts... My take is, since rolling doesn't really do much, I don't want to incur any risk after market closes and before it opens when it is OTM,... ITM is another story, since I already lost a bunch of money, I might as well stay in the trade to see if it recovers.
3. Any ideas of how to improve my strategy? I though also doing OTM call spreads in addition to the covered puts

Thank You for your answer!

Cash Sweep Interest Rate Accuracy - What am I missing?,7,186orsj,RobinHood,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/186orsj/cash_sweep_interest_rate_accuracy_what_am_i/,2,"I'm a Robinhood Gold member who is at home looking at numbers all day because I don't have much else to do. Yesterday, I earned $4.02 in interest, but I think I should have earned $4.10. Why the $0.08 difference?

Now that the advertised interest rate is 5% APY, my math shows I'm actually making 4.89%. And when the interest rate was advertised at 4.9%, my math was showing a 4.79% daily interest rate.

At first, I thought they were holding back a little bit to make the $5/month payment for the Robinhood Gold membership, but that is billed separately (at least in notifications). 

    For calculations, I'm using the formula: 
            Daily Interest = (Principal Amount x APY) / 365
    
    I'm happy to share all my number/math. Is anyone else showing a daily interest rate accumulation a few cents lower than the formula above says is should be?",1701262588.0
Lucky success but where do I go from here?,35,186aqyt,RobinHood,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/186aqyt,48,"Hello everyone! I got extremely lucky when I bought 1 TSLA share under $300 in 2019 and gained 14 more from all the splits. I currently have $4,500 with TSLA being 80% of my portfolio.I am curious what people think my next route should be? I am definitely more of a long term investor. Should I just liquidate my TSLA stock and just shove it all into ETF's? Sorry If this is one of those annoying posts asking stupid questions!",1701215191.0

"Pretty sure I know the answer, but I made a doody and sent ERC-20 Polygon to Robinhood.",1,182b5j4,RobinHood,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/182b5j4/pretty_sure_i_know_the_answer_but_i_made_a_doody/,0,"I was cleaning up and out my wallets sending things to various exchanges and DEXs. I decided my Robinhood could use a few bucks and I had some old Polygon laying around on ETH. I decided to send that to my Robinhood ETH address aaaaaand it's gone. My assumption is that I'll have to wait until Robinhood (unlikely) supports Polygon again to see it, but maybe not even then since I sent it on ETH. I'm aware this is entirely my fault, I realized after sending it that there was literally a warning that said ""don't send anything but ETH to this address or it may be lost"".

I had just been using exchanges to play with crypto since about 2014, but after the whole meltdown of 2022 I started figuring out DEXs and self custody so I'm still pretty new despite being here for a while. Thankfully it was only a few hundred bucks I've thrown into the abyss and I can chalk it up as a learning experience, but it'd be cool if I could get that Polygon back along with the lesson.

Does Maintenance Margin Fluctuate?,3,177iey0,RobinHood,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/177iey0/does_maintenance_margin_fluctuate/,0,"Does maintenance margin change 1:1 with the stock price's change or is it fixed at the time of purchase? 

>According to Investopedia's definition:  So if an investor has $10,000 worth of equity in their margin account,  they must maintain a minimum amount of $2,500 in the margin account. If  the value of their equity increases to $15,000, then the maintenance  margin also rises to $3,750. The investor is hit with a margin call if the value of securities falls below the maintenance margin. 

If maintenance margin moves with the stock price, wouldn't it be impossible to get margin called since if the stock price drops, the maintenance margin will drop a proportional amount? For example, in the above example, if the stock dropped to $5,000, wouldn't the mainenance margin be $1,000 (25% of $5K)? Can someone address where I'm wrong and overview maintenance margin if possible. Thanks!

One month has passed since my initial post, and about 15% later the IWM looks ready to burst after testing its 5 year old prior support level.

People who are betting against small caps waiting for a financial apocalypse to happen are fighting the last war. The megacap trade was all about fear, the massive move in IWM and banks will be about reality and the financial and economic conditions that are going to create a new leadership in earnings growth.

If you dont understand why banks with strong enough core holdings are going to become a darwinian wet dream of financial king makers, then you probably have only lived and traded thru the low interest world of the post 2008 financial collapse.

Anyways, as I said a month ago, enjoy chasing my shares up, this has legs (i mean years not weeks)

22 and want to grow my savings,0,188fumn,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/188fumn/22_and_want_to_grow_my_savings/,10,"22 and wanna grow my savings

Hey everyone,

I‚Äôm 22 and just got out of college. I am lucky enough to have no debt and am double lucky because my parents have given me access to funds they started when I was born so I now have around 100k-120k to spend however I want. This includes any master degree, wedding, first house or any other major life expenses.

I want to grow my savings as I don‚Äôt expect major expenses to be close.

I also started my first job in NYC and am bringing 65k a year before around 10k bonus.

I invest 5% into a 401k with a 4% match, will probably max out my Roth IRA for 2023 and years to come through my savings/bonus.

That leaves me with around 100k to still invest how I want.

I was thinking of doing 15% into a high savings account (currently getting 5% with Robinhood gold), 15% into bonds (might get Goldman Sachs bonds at around 6%-7% YTM) and the rest into index and ETF. 

What I wanna know is:

- Is that a good plan?
- What can I improve?
- What index/ETF do you recommend?

Thanks! 

PS: this is my first Reddit post so feel free to tell me what to do better for next time.

PS: feel free to ask for more info if needed",1701447682.0

Some our favourite Charlie Munger quotes,115,186tzym,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/186tzym/some_our_favourite_charlie_munger_quotes/,16,"1. Investing is where you find a few great companies and then sit on your ass.

2. Like Warren, I had a considerable passion to get rich, not because I wanted Ferrari's - I wanted the independence.

3. You don't have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long time.

4. One of the greatest ways to avoid trouble is to keep it simple... the system often goes out of control.

5. A lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they've got terrible temperaments.

6. Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant.

7. If a business earns 18% on capital over 20 or 30 years, even if you pay an expensive looking price, you‚Äôll end up with a fine result.

8. A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price.

9.  You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads -at how much I read. They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out.

10. The best thing a human can do is to help another human being know more.

11. To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. The world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of undeserving people.

12. Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Day by day, and at the end of the day-if you live long enough-like most people, you will get out of life what you deserve.

13. How to find a good spouse? The best single way is to deserve a good spouse.

14. We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand.

15. Invert, always invert: Turn a situation or problem upside down. Look at it backward.

16. It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be intelligent.

17. It‚Äôs the work on your desk. Do well with what you already have and more will come in.

18. Mimicking the herd invites regression to the mean.

19. Always take the high road, it‚Äôs far less crowded.

20. Every time you hear EBITDA, just substitute it with bullshit",1701276611.0

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2024-01-05.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

Munger, legendary investor and Berkshire Hathaway vice president, passes away at age 99

Charles Thomas Munger, known as Charlie Munger, passed away today at the age of 98. He was a global finance icon thanks to his extraordinary talents as a value investor and his transformative business vision.

As a key partner of the renowned Warren Buffett in the creation of one of the most successful companies in the United States, Munger served as Vice President of Berkshire Hathaway for over 40 years, a conglomerate that under his leadership became a powerhouse valued in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

Acclaimed for his insight, discipline, and long-term focus on identifying undervalued quality companies, Munger built alongside Buffett one of the most enviable corporate investment portfolios which included gems like Coca-Cola, American Express and Gillette.

Beyond the numbers, Munger leaves a legacy of business wisdom centered on sound principles: from seeking lasting competitive advantages to eliminating unnecessary complexities in order to make better decisions. His teachings inspired generations of leaders and investors.

Although far from the glitz of Wall Street, he devoted much of his time and fortune to philanthropic projects, especially in education and health through institutions such as the University of Michigan and Children‚Äôs Hospital Los Angeles.

Charlie Munger will be remembered for forever transforming how prosperous companies are built and engaging with the communities that welcome them. An unrepeatable visionary.

How to determine the starting price of a triangular reverse merger? Are any current examples in the stock market?,3,185aayp,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/185aayp/how_to_determine_the_starting_price_of_a/,3,"I have endlessly looked for the answer on google, but so far I haven't found anything. Maybe, my question hasn't been formulated good enough. Please, forgive me, English is my second language, but I will try to explain what I am trying to find out, in hopes that someone in here can help me understand.

&#x200B;

**This is my current understanding of how a reverse triangular merger occurs:**

* There is a private company that wishes to acquire a public company (ticker ABC)
* The private company also wants to go public, let's say, at the NASDAQ
* The private company creates a shell company where the latter will acquire the public company
* Once the shell company acquires the public company, the private company acquires the shell company and goes public with a new ticker (XYZ)

&#x200B;

**The following is where I hope to make myself understood as best as possible:**

So, let's say that the merger reaches completion. Now, on the very first day where ticker ABC turns to XYZ, does the chart of ABC remains? Meaning, does the history of ABC can still be seen on the chart even though the ticker is now XYZ because the private company is now public?

I started to become familiar with the stock market back in February 2021. All the news of GME and AMC drew me in, and a whole new world was revealed to me. I was just sitting on the sidelines, reading the news and learning about the stock market, because I wanted to day trade.  


The day came where I started day trading, and luck was by my side. I made good money. Then, in June 2021, I became interested in company ABC, and I invested in it. It turned out to be a scam, but I didn't know about this until almost two years later. However, during all that time, I kept adding and averaging down, believing that they had a good product. At some point, I just stopped adding and just waited to see the final news. The news weren't good at all. It was a bad product, and the price plummeted, after going through a reverse split first.

&#x200B;

I waited for the price to be as low as possible, and I started to add again, hoping that at some point the company could provide some news on how to distribute the money and thus making the share price go up. The market value was way too low compared to its book value. And luck was again by my side, I timed everything correctly. And after being around $10-15K down for about a year, I was suddenly up $22K. The reason being because the company released news that a private company is going to buy the public company for a superb premium. They will do this through what they called a reverse triangular merger.

&#x200B;

Now, as I said previously, many shenanigans have happened and I think they're about to happen again, but I discovered this too late. I'm down again $5K. The public company wants to do another reverse split because a reverse merger can not happen if the share price is under $4.00 per share. I wish I had known about that rule and I would have cashed out and wait to get a better position.

&#x200B;

You are probably asking why not get out, take the loss and just start day trading again, or why be so obsessed with this company? Since June 2021, I was naively following the posts on Stocktwits, Yahoo Finance and Webull (my broker). The person posting there about the public company ABC was always the same person but with so many different accounts. I think that he has a team doing all the PR, the posting, and the technicalities of the buy, selling and shorting of the shares of ABC.

&#x200B;

However, that person has made some mistakes and I caught on. Sometimes, he has posted the same thing on different accounts, word for word. Sometimes, he's been able to erase the posts on time, and other times he just forgets about it or is simply too lazy, thinking that maybe nobody is reading him. I think, to a certain extent, he's very arrogant because of the power that he wields. My guess is that he's very young but extremely smart with numbers and very knowledgeable in the stock market world.

&#x200B;

Nevertheless, the key mistakes are the following:

* He has posted under different accounts images of somebody's P&L only holding the ABC shares.
* The images are from different brokers, sometimes in different languages. I believe they're from some Scandinavian country some of them
* The averages run from $78.00, $40.00, $22.00 and $8.00

&#x200B;

And what I think that is going to happen is that once the new private company becomes public, then the price will go up drastically and rapidly because the other accounts with, at the current moment, losing averages ($78, $40, $22, $8) will be the points to grapple on in order to increase the price. Why do I think this? Because this guy or people have also posted about two other companies where the share price went up from like $2 to $45 and $60 in about 30 minutes. I always wondered how that could be possible, and I think that this is how they do it. Seeds have been planted with key averages which at some point are going to be bought to increase the price ten fold in a matter of minutes.

&#x200B;

If my theory is right, then of course my average is awesome, and I could avoid a lot of taxes if I just hold on to my shares. I have held since June 2021, and I haven't sold ever. However, if the new reverse split is to happen, then most likely the price is going to be manipulated and the price should go down to what I believe just above $4.00. The reverse split that is being proposed is 1 to 2 -- 1 to 5, depending on some bs. The current price is below $4.00. If the final price previous to the RS is $3, then after the RS the new price is going to be at the least $6 or at the most $15. And that should drop it back to just above $4.00 in order for the reverse merger to happen. If this is what is going to happen, then I can sell, because I could just acquire the shares at a very much much cheaper price, in case that the share price sky rockets once the merger is completed, then taxes are just going to be irrelevant due to how much money could potentially be made.

&#x200B;

So, again, my question is will the old chart continue to be but just now under a new ticker? Or will the new ticker start a new chart? Please, don't ask me info about the real ticker. The question is simple I think. And I need to know if the old chart will continue to exist because that's how I could visually see if the grapple points have been reached.

&#x200B;

We are in a Tech Bubble,0,184my70,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/184my70,98,"For context, I‚Äôm referring back to a 2015 article displaying P/E ratios during the .com boom in early 2000‚Äôs compared to the same tech stocks during that time period. Compare the data to now‚Ä¶

Think about it logically:

Some of these tech stocks have triple digit P/E ratios.

Influx of cash created the Covid bubble 2022, then pullback to the mean reversion (-22%). We‚Äôre talking millions of dollars given out to hands that had no means of taking that money. Fraudulent ppp loans, people hoarding covid relief like candy. Tons of businesses getting funding to keep the lights on while they use the money for other stuff stimulating the economy.

We are now up 19% YTD (S&P) and up over 37% on the nasddaq. With the tightening of monetary policy and 7 stocks making up like 10% of the S&P, it just makes no sense.

Think about the market cap of nvidia at 1 trillion. Does that stock deserve to stand at 1/3 the market cap as Apple and half the market cap of MSFT?????? Make it make sense.

‚Ä¶and the P/E ratio of AMD at 967, all while analysts rate it as a strong buy

DOES THAT NOT SEEM ABSURD?!

Think about the current pe ratios in general and look at this article from 2015.

And you have lost faith in it.

For easy figures say you purchased 5000 worth, now it‚Äôs worth 1000. So you own 50 shares.

As an alternative of selling and taking the loss, would buying whatever number of shares you need to average down to the current ‚Ç¨20 price ever make sense?

In this example, roughly you‚Äôd need to buy another 4000 shares @‚Ç¨20 = ‚Ç¨80000. ‚Ç¨85000 / 4050 shares = ‚Ç¨21 So assuming you had enough money to buy another ‚Ç¨80000 worth and then cash out at a breakeven BEP, would this be just stupid as my instinct suggests or is there ever a valid circumstance or scenario to do this?

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-12-29.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

**Current Tools & Limitations:** So far, I‚Äôve been using yfinance in Python for stock data, but it falls short in providing the specific data I‚Äôm seeking. I even stumbled upon a promising Yahoo Finance page about NYSE advance/decline data, but it seems to not contain any data.

**Examples:** I‚Äôve linked to examples of the type of data I‚Äôm looking for.

Initially, I considered downloading via Python using ‚Äòrequests‚Äô or scraping with Beautiful Soup. However, both methods pose a challenge due to the necessity of being logged in, which could potentially be disrupted by captchas in the future.

Will the Sustainable Aviation Fuel market be one of the largest growing markets this century?,88,17zb22p,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/17zb22p,32,"With the International Air Transport Association expecting Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) - biofuels which can blend with fossil keroscene - to make up 65% of the reduction needed to bring the airline industry to net zero in 2050, it looks like it will dominante over electric and hydrogen-powered air travel.

To make sure airlines commit to this blending trajectory, the EU has passed the ReFuelEU legislation this year. As shown in photo 1, airlines are LEGALLY REQUIRED to meet these % blends. Beginning at a 2% blend in 2025, 6% in 2030, 20% in 2035, and gradually to 70% in 2050. Other nations from the US to Japan have also introduced mandates, with a 100% blend required by 2050 in the US. 

This is insane. So much so that the World Economic Forum had SAF within its top 10 emerging technologies in 2023, alongside AI in top 3. Yet with the huge buzz around AI, SAF seems a dark knight if the economics can line up.

The US Inflation Reduction Act also includes a tax credit for SAF to help subsidise the industry, amongst other SAF tax credits on State-levels, such as Washington. More governments are introducing subsidies to accelerate growth. 

Routes to create SAF include: 

-Hydrotreating (e.g. used cooking oil inputs). -Alcohol-to-jet (e.g. ethanol inputs). 
-Synthetic fuels/e-fuels (e.g. CO2 and green hydrogen inputs). 
-Gasification and Fischer-Trosch (e.g. landfill waste inputs).

There is a lot of hype for synthetic fuels especially, hence the submandate under ReFuelEU. Although hydrotreating has mostly been used to produce the majority of SAF to date.

People need to wake up to SAF and see how huge these next decades will be for the industry, especially since it's a legally required product to purchase at such insane volumes.

Any Advice?,2,17zrm20,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17zrm20/any_advice/,23,"Hey guys! I am not new, but I am ""new"" to stock world. I had some minor successes but alot more losses. For the most part I've had mediocre success. I Had my first stock call last year where I went in on reed stock and lost a good amount of money. I am okay with risk, that's not the problem, but my big problem is I don't know how to begin researching this information.

Currently my strategy has been word of mouth. Which has me a stable portfolio, but not one I'm proud of. I don't know how to begin looking for stocks to invest in. I know S&P stocks are great but I want to be a bit more risky. 

So what I really am asking is, can someone recommend sites they get information from. Tools they use etc and just generic information that I need to start making better investments.

Carvana(CVNA) business model question.,37,17y5lpf,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17y5lpf/carvanacvna_business_model_question/,26,"So I will start with why I am writing this:

I need to find who is buying the Asset Backed Securities(ABS) that Carvana (CVNA) is packaging and selling.

Now the long story:

I sold my used car to Carvana about a year ago for roughly 18K. This was a great deal for me since I saw similar cars to mine listed at local dealerships for about the same price. Like many have said, I scratched my head and got rid of it since it also needed new tires and brakes and I knew I could not sell it to a private party for that much. Why look a gift horse in the mouth.

Now, a year later, I want to get another car for my kid and have noticed that there are virtually no good private seller listings on craigslist(where I usually buy my cars from). On there, I can cut out the middle man(used car dealer) and split the savings with the seller.

The one or two sellers I found were asking far too high a price c/w a used car dealer and when I point this out they point out the fact that they can sell it for roughly that much..you guessed it..to Carvana!

What everyone has been saying is true, Carvana is artificially inflating the used car market. This is not a question but a well known fact for 2-3 years.

But why? Used car prices are dropping fast(check inflation reports or simply CarGuru's used car price index) soooo Carvana must be freaking out right??? Time to short CVNA right???!!!!

Nope.

They make their money another way: Giving high interest loans to buyers with poor credit at high loan to value,LTV, (100% often) and putting all these loans together, packaging them and selling them to someone else, collecting a fee for this...

So by inflating the prices, they actually make more money b/c their side(or actually main) business has more gross volume.

The underwriters of these loans are your major players like WellsFargo and Citibank etc... but they are not the ""bagholders "". They sell these. My question is:

I want to find out who actually owns the bags which is remarkably hard to do.

Can anyone help?

On a side note, doesn't this sound all too familiar with housing in 2007? I am hoping there are no credit default swaps involved or I will have a heart attack ;-)

Welcome to the third entry in our ""Anatomy of a Breakout"" series focusing on TWST. If you need a refresher on the intro or the ground rules, or to just review where we started vs. where we are today, please see our first two installments (links above). Also, please read the entire article before making assumptions.

**Analysis:**

\*\*\* We are officially on breakout alert. \*\*\*

The chart in progress continues to look extremely constructive and is doing exactly what was expected. Let's review what I shared in the previous installment:

*""What this still needs is a fifth higher high as v of (iii) then a (iv) retrace and a (v) higher high for all of 1.""*

As it turned out, what I originally counted as iii of (iii) was actually all of (iii), which we would have been able to tell by looking at the nano (1min) view. This got just one more higher high for all of 1, which keeps it proportional to the entire expected move given the size of the fifth wave up.

Keep in mind what I said at the beginning: though this system can apply to most assets, analyzing sentiment is inherently more accurate when applied against stocks with greater market cap and share transaction volume. The nano won't always be perfect with these smaller-cap stocks, but in our case it's a nuance that doesn't change the overall view.

**Chart:**

[TWST Micro \(8min\) Attempt: Extremely Constructive](https://preview.redd.it/x4zaed93as0c1.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=bfe00f4e13bb125fb5777eb32e4c16c80bd3f3bc)

\*\*\* I repeat, we are officially on breakout alert. \*\*\*

What this needs is the following:

* A completion of the (c) wave down to the circle-II target shown above, preferably at the point where (a) = (c) or $17.22 though anywhere from $17.04 - $18.59 is a reasonable zone to initiate or add. *See Technical Note 1.*
* A micro degree five waves up for wave (i) of circle-III. *See Technical Note 2.*
* A three-wave decline that ideally retraces approximately 38.2% - 61.8% of wave (i). This can be a very quick move as we are approaching the ""heart"" of the move.
* A break above the circle-I high of $21.31. Again, this will likely happen quickly.

**Expectations:**

To reiterate, assuming common Fibonacci Pinball rules apply, our most common upside target will be $30.93. Let's see how this can happen in the more micro view.

Third waves often target the 1.618 extension of wave 1. Wave 1 topped at $19.55 and the entire wave was $5.13, so we'd look for an $8.30 move targeting $27.85 ($5.13 x 1.618 = $8.30; $8.30 + $19.55) for all of 3. The completion of wave 5 should get us to our \~$31 target. Note that waves 3 and/or 5 can extend which would simply point us higher.

*It is important to set a stop loss at $15.87. Should we break below wave 2, the entire setup is rendered unreliable. With a basis in the mid-to-upper $17's, this leaves risk of \~$2 or less vs. reward of \~$13 or more. That's extremely strong R:R.*

**Technical Notes:**

1. Remember, c waves are often five-wave moves. As of market close today, we are working on the third wave of that (c) wave. *That said, though it would be unconventional, we do have three waves down and this can really reverse at any time.* It is highly probable to at least get to the 50% retrace at $18.59 and it should more likely reach *at least* the 61.8% retrace at $17.95. To reiterate what is shown on the chart, the point where (a) = (c) would be \~$17.22 (which is just above the 76.4% retrace so it could leak pennies lower). As $17.22 would be the most common target, I personally will be buying in tranches at $18.60, $18.00, and $17.25. *This is not financial advice.*
2. Circle-III is comprised of five waves, (i) through (v). Wave (iii) is itself a five-wave move, i-v. All of wave 3 needs Circles I-V and we're due to complete Circle-II by tomorrow. We *may* even complete (i) of Circle-III and begin the real move. Stay on your heels.

**General/Q&A:**

If you have questions, please ask. If you have legitimate concerns, disagreements, etc. please feel free. If you're here to bash the analysis, feel free to do so elsewhere. You don't have to agree or use the analysis, but if it doesn't suit you, please leave it at that.

I Thought Small-Cap Stocks Were Younger And Faster Growing,18,17woi1u,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17woi1u/i_thought_smallcap_stocks_were_younger_and_faster/,7,"  

https://preview.redd.it/dg3g9tow1q0c1.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=d119e41b97f67215fec6c63f4af7e2796fb5cdec

Maybe this is just me but I always held the view that the Small-Cap index was chock-full of punchy, growing companies just waiting for their shot at the big time on the Large-Cap index. Sure there's some dogs in there but the idea that Large-Caps are big and safe, and that the Small-Caps are more volatile and risky but faster growing, I figured was the norm.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/c17knq2y1q0c1.png?width=1022&format=png&auto=webp&s=905d8887b1a62ad267118cb0f99d5656f9a094e0

But while I was tinkering a bit yesterday, I looked into the valuation history of the small-cap world (ok, just the S&P 600) and I was surprised by the size and persistence of the valuation spread between large-cap (S&P 500) and small-cap (again, S&P 600) companies. Looking at forward P/Es, the spread over the last five years has averaged 4.6x. That‚Äôs not nothing. *That‚Äôs a 31% premium from the small-caps.*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ugbjj5sy1q0c1.png?width=936&format=png&auto=webp&s=446efce8dbc572ee7523bb2435c960a1fad48344

Based on that, I looked into Wall Street estimates because, if my view that Small-Caps are faster growing, then there could be a nice bargain to be had by moving down cap. Anyway, I was pretty surprised to see that growth broadly in Small-Caps is much lower than the Large-Caps - one third to be exact for forward EPS two years out. And yes, Small-Caps get whacked more in recessions, so their estimates could be taking it on the chin in 2023/2024, but I just assumed there would be more growth into a (potentially) cleaner 2025 and beyond. *What gives? Where are all of my zestful growth stocks?*

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/lk7gbyrz1q0c1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=85dc0f719fd0cb52718fde26460b3fbd8e977c41

Anyway, while I don't think this explains all (or even most) of this growth gap, but digging a little deeper, I found that the average age of the S&P 600 is actually 40 years old. 40! Practically a Boomer. So I think I need to update my views on Small-Caps (or at least what's bucketed into the S&P 600) as being these fresh-faced, punchy upstarts with a volatile but strong growth outlook.

This leaves me with the question, *why would anyone ever invest in this Index?* Sure, maybe if the spread got too wide, you could try to arb it over the short-term. And there are some gems hidden within, for sure (to be invested in individually). But as a long-term, core part of your portfolio, why would you even bother? Weaker growth. Volatile. Loaded with has-beens and never-wases. I think I‚Äôll stick to my SPY and QQQ.

Anyway, just my thoughts. I'm definitely over simplifying and glazing over a lot here. I'm curious if anyone here is actually a die-hard Small-Cap index fan and keeps a good chunk of their PA in them? If so what is your thesis here?",1700145709.0

SP500 TA & Trading Plan for 11/17/23,0,17wxofm,StockMarket,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/17wxofm/sp500_ta_trading_plan_for_111723/,0,"*I share my plan for discussion or education and it is not intended for use as trade recommendations or ideas.*

***Recap***: I first tried a long trade this morning on a support level from **4515-17**, but being an intermediate level in the balance area, I sized down and soon after exited for a small loss. The market then pulled back to backtest the green structure at **4505**, which I said would be an important gauge for bull strength to keep the recent rally going, and this set up a textbook entry described in the plan for today. I entered this trade with full size at 11:15am EST and had to hold through the discomfort of a deeper pullback below that level, but it eventually recovered. I exited at the next level up (**4515-17**) and left a runner that got taken out at breakeven.

***Balance/Trend***: The market continues to consolidate as bullish momentum takes a pause in the balance area from **4496-4544** after the huge CPI rally on Tuesday. Short, medium, and long term trends are all pointing up. Medium-term resistance lies overhead at **4540** and support, marked in green, just below at **4506**.

***Analysis***: Markets are always in a trend or consolidation pattern of some sort and after these patterns form, the market breaks from them and then retests to check the validity of the breakout. After breaking out from the green channel in June, the market made this backtest today at 4505 but bulls still didn‚Äôt manage any meaningful continuation higher from this consolidation pattern. Holding this level should get the market back to medium-term resistance, but on any failures at 4506, bulls will look to hold **4496**, or **4484** at the lowest to keep this recent three-week rally alive. 

* Potential supports: **4509-15, 4506, 4496, 4484, 4446-50, 4437, 4409-12**

***Recap***: Continued trade above important breakout points and trend lines kept bulls in control today, getting the market to red line resistance at **4540** (this was misquoted in the write-up but correct in the charts, and accounted for by a separate, confluent resistance level). I had a plan to trade it, but didn‚Äôt take the trade per my policy of not trading before/during economic releases. Instead, I waited for this one: ‚Äú*I‚Äôll be looking to trade that \[support at* ***4509-15****\]*‚Äù and ‚Äú*this could be a spot to open a position for further upside to* ***4529****‚Äù*. This was the trade I took today.

***Balance/Trend***: The market is back inside of an old balance area from **4496-4544** and has spent the majority of the post-CPI rally consolidating there. I‚Äôve added a new trend line to the charts in aqua blue to show just how sharp and strong this relief rally has been, which you can appreciate by comparing to the slope of the green, yellow, and blue lines. This would put support at **4460** tomorrow.¬†

***Analysis***: The market remains in a clear breakout from the falling price channel marked in black which outlined the nearly 12% correction/pullback from late July to last week/yesterday. Additionally, yesterday‚Äôs post-CPI release surge took the market higher and away from the green channel, which the market broke out from back in June. Bulls can keep the market from slipping back into these green and black channels by holding **4505** and **4416** respectively. Trends this steep rarely last long (>400 points and 10% in three weeks), but on moves below **4505** I‚Äôm watching trend support at **4460** to keep this move intact. On breakdowns from there, the backtest of the black trend channel will be a major decision point.¬†

- **Historical Move v Implied Move:** We determine the historical volatility (log variance of daily gains) of the underlying asset and compare that to the current implied volatitlity (IV) of the option price. This is used to determine the Call or Put Premium associated with the pricing of options (implied volatility).
    
- **Directional Bias:** Ranges from -100 (bearish) to +100 (bullish) and accounts for RSI, price trend, moving averages, and put/call skew over the past 6 weeks.

- **Priced Move:** given the current option prices, how much in dollar amounts will the underlying have to move to make the call/put break even. This is how much vol the option is pricing in. The expected move.

- **Expiration:** 2023-12-22.

- **Call/Put Premium:** How much extra you are paying for the implied move relative to the historic move. Low numbers mean options are ""cheaper."" High numbers mean options are ""expensive.""

- **Efficiency:** This factor represents the bid/ask spreads and the depth of the order book relative to the price of the option. It represents how much traders will pay in slippage with a round trip trade. Lower numbers are less efficient than higher numbers.

***Recap***: All eyes were on CPI today and I wrote that *‚ÄúBulls need to keep the market above* ***4423*** *tomorrow to stay outside of that channel, while holding above* ***4433*** *keeps the market in a breakout from the continuation flag in pink‚Äù* and *‚ÄúOn continued bullishness, I am watching for a gap fill up to* ***4446*** *which, if breached, could initiate an extended rally to* ***4496***\*-**4500**‚Äù.\* Much of this move happened in just one 15-minute period after the data release, touching down to **4423** and exploding higher. There was a great entry to be had on the consolidation there for those willing to accept the risk, but I didn‚Äôt and never open a trade before a major data release.

I took two trades on the day: The first was my highest risk type of trade, a small scalp short off of **4501**. This saw practically no continuation lower after I entered and I cut the trade at breakeven. The next trade wasn‚Äôt fully pre planned, but came from the resistance level at **4519** in the detailed charts and shared in the plan. I found that the entry signaling and price rejection there merited an entry for a pullback, and entered short and exited at **4503**. My runner was taken out at breakeven as the market resumed the move higher. That level was tested twice again before rallying, selling off again, and then closing just higher.

***Balance/Trend***: Short, medium, and long-term trends are all pointing up after a \~400 point rally from late October to today‚Äôs highs. After the action from late October to early November, the market entered its usual cycle of post-trend consolidation before finally breaking out today. Importantly for bulls, they‚Äôve also broken the market out from the trend channel marked in black which defined the decline from July. Some of the steeper trends that we saw earlier this year are still much higher and not in play yet.

***Analysis:*** Bulls have been in charge for all of November and the market is now just \~175 points away from the 2023 highs. If seasonality holds true, the market should get back there this year. After breaking out from the green channel, bulls will need to defend any backtests of the structure to **4503** to keep near-term upside potential in play. If they can hold it there, I like the odds of a move back to the old resistance line marked in red at **4528** followed by **4540**. On a failure, the first level bears will want to reclaim is **4496-99** followed by **4484**, which, if lost, could lead to a deeper pullback.

* Potential supports: **4503, 4496-99, 4484, 4445, 4437-8, 4415, 4403-05, 4375**
* Potential resistances: **4528, 4535, 4540, 4544, 4559, 4566, 4585, 4592, 4598**

Lump sum (LS) vs dollar cost averaging (DCA),1,188a9jz,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/188a9jz/lump_sum_ls_vs_dollar_cost_averaging_dca/,2,"I guess this is a never-ending holy war but here are my two cents nobody seems to mention.  
  
The main argument for LS is that statistically it's more profitable to always be in the market and never bet against it. Doing DCA you're prolonging the time each of your money batch stays out of the market. Partially you're betting against the market doing this. It's been proven by a number of researches that LS wins in much more cases than DCA.  
  
However, nobody seems to mention the distribution of risk.  
  
With LS there's a small chance of getting terrible results, such as putting all your money into the market on a peak right before an economic depression which can last decades.  
  
With DCA there's a chance of getting negative returns too but their magnitude is much smaller.  
  
When you're doing DCA you are reducing the chances of getting better results but also you're reducing the chances of getting terrible results. I consider this as paying a fee against terrible outcomes, just like insurance.

From Spreadsheet to Custom App: My Journey to a Better Investment Overview,1,186s6wm,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/186s6wm/from_spreadsheet_to_custom_app_my_journey_to_a/,0,"Not sure how others do this, but when I started investing, I chose to meticulously track all my data in a spreadsheet. The primary reason was having different types of investments with various providers and apps, leading to a lack of a comprehensive overview. Additionally, I found that when you move an index fund from one major bank to another, you lose the historical growth of that investment because you lose access to your old bank app.

Previously, I would update the individual values of all my investments monthly, including any purchases and sales, in a simple Google Sheets document. I also had some simple charts to track the evolution of my portfolio over time.

However, over time, I realized that I wanted more aspects of my portfolio visualized, such as various types of charts. This eventually required quite a few non-trivial calculations in Google Sheets, and the idea emerged that if I was interested in this, others probably would be too. Given my background in IT, I ultimately decided to build my own app.

It might be relevant for other Redditors here as well who, like me, used to track everything in a spreadsheet. The app has only recently gone live, but if you want to give it a try, I'd love to hear what you think and where I could possibly make improvements.

She ""dropped"" me at the moment when I said I was not sure if I want to pay 3k EUR in her offering. She was very definitive, you either accept now or we part ways. Sassy and just graduated from uni (not saying you need an uni degree to trade stock, but I do feel her lack of life experience shows when she's very pushy in trying different sales techniques). She ultimately said I don't have the ""quality or mindset"" if I don't decide in the moment. I find it absurd. She also tried many sales techniques, being harsh, being nice, being empathetic... but yeah towards the end she said no to me because I said I can't make a decision like that.

I don't think I have great knowledge in stock and was passive and that's why the idea of mentor sounds something that could help. But I just wasn't sure if I want to pay 3k on some girls who kind of seems to be in MLM scheme?

But after few days have past since this event, I also have a more objective view on this.

Ultimately, I made a 77% return this year, -45% last year, +18% 2021, 25% in 2020. So I can safely say l'm not too bad and happy I saved that 3k EUR for something else.

Maybe more stock or perhaps a better and more qualified mentor in the future.

Here is the framework by which Mars 360 could replace the US Constitution and US dollar,0,181h9iv,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/181h9iv/here_is_the_framework_by_which_mars_360_could/,0,"This gives a brief overview of the system

[https://www.academia.edu/82225535/The\_Mars\_Redback\_Currency\_System](https://www.academia.edu/82225535/The_Mars_Redback_Currency_System)

*The Mars 360 social/financial theory takes aspects related to an individual's astrological Mars placement-according to how it is explained in ""The Mars 360 Religious and Social System"", and has it displayed within a social environment, and combines that with the aspect of buying and selling within that framework. This means that in order for this currency system to work, a person has to believe that Mars influences human beings. And one does not have to call it faith-based. It can simply be hypothesis-based or theory-based, no different than how quantum theory is fostered in the scientific community. This currency system is similar to how private currencies are issued within local communities to encourage spending and economic development within that community. As a contingency plan in the case of obtuseness toward the impact of inflation, a small community would develop as a scientific study. Within that community, each person would calculate where Mars was at the time they were born according to the framework laid out in the book ""The Mars 360 Religious and Social System"" which divides the astrology chart into 6 sections. The community would then see to it that the individual's rights under their own Mars influence is not violated....meaning that the characteristics associated with the negative Mars influence (according to where it's positioned in the chart) would be allowed some healthy expression(healthy meaning enough to where humans can still co-exist). Mars is responsible for negative habits dispersed amongst the 6 possible positions: 1. poor face-to-face communication/interaction 2. hyperactivity/reckless thoughts 3. debauchery 4. hyper-opinionated/cultural bias 5. laziness/disobedience and 6. introversion/sillyness. The reason the idea of an outward display of Mars's position in an individual's birthchart is presented is because it would precipitate ""understanding,"" allowing people to prepare or know in advance how to deal with the individual and vice versa without having to go through any extended learning phase, which oftentimes gives rise to contention.*

Now here is how the system is applied in practice

[https://www.academia.edu/109310221/How\_the\_Mars\_360\_system\_changes\_the\_law\_and\_morality](https://www.academia.edu/109310221/How_the_Mars_360_system_changes_the_law_and_morality)

*This system divides the entire human race into six categories. A person 's astrological birthchart and the location of Mars thereof is used to determine how the law will be applied to that individual. The law under Mars 360 is not applied uniformly across the population, but is based on where Mars was situated at the time a person was born, along with the personality characteristics that define that position. This would take precedence over race and nationality and could be used to implement a one world government, with people now primarily identified based on Mars factors. Other aspects of identity, such as nationality and race would take a backseat Read the document and see which set of privileges would be most suited to you*",1700680811.0

Looking For Opinions,1,180p3ad,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/180p3ad/looking_for_opinions/,0,"Hello everyone, I'm pretty new to investing in general but I would like some advice on my current situation. This might be a bit of a read. 

(TLDR: wondering if I should move all my money to Wealth Simple TFSA from Scotiabank Mutual Fund, and what to do with 50-150k inheritance)

  
Basically I'm 29, living in Ontario, Canada, and just began getting my finances together last year finally. I began last year and managed to save about 4k in 2022 (I work low paying jobs) and another 7k this year.

  
So 7.5k of my money is sitting in a TFSA mutual fund through Scotiabank (I've made about $100 profit since May), and the other 3.5k I have in my Wealth Simple TFSA and manage my portfolio there. I have been thoroughly enjoying managing my portfolio, and lately have been thinking that I am missing out on a ton of potential dividend growth by having my other 7.5k elsewhere. Do you think I should just move everything over into my Wealth Simple in order to really kickstart my dividend growth? Or keep that money aside in a ""safer"" mutual fund through Scotia? Now for the next piece of my puzzle.

  
Next year I will be coming into some inheritance money. I do not know the amount, but based on what I do know, it will be somewhere up to 150k. I plan on putting a large chunk of whatever  I get into dividend stocks within my TFSA and taking the spring/summer off work to bike across Ontario - something I've always wanted to do but could not afford to take time off for. The plan would be to use my dividends to fuel my very few, cheap needs each month (basically phone bill and food) while having the majority of it DRIP. 

  
My plan is to buy very cheap land in North Ontario and build my own infrastructure from the ground up - so I don't need a million dollars to live my life. I would like to have this money grow via drip for the next couple of years while I prepare the things I need to live the lifestyle that I want to live.

  
Now I am just kind of looking for opinions in general here, but here are some of the stocks that I have really come to like since beginning investing and would probably put most of the money into. I am less focused on massive growth, more on good yield with ""safe"" companies.

  
ENB, AQN, BNS, CNQ, T, SRU, FTS, BMO, TOU, CU are some of my favourites. Generally they are dividend aristocrats/kings and offer from about 4-7% yield, with some REITS thrown in for good measure. 

  
I am trying to make sure I invest this money properly so that I can have an income stream that will be able to pay for the things I need while also reinvesting dividends to continue growth, and to have something to leave for my younger sisters when I am gone. 

  
So, what are your thoughts? Should I consolidate everything into my portfolio? Do you think the plan with my inheritance is fine? I considered putting some into GIC's since rates are good but I just feel like it will do more for me in dividends... Again I am new! Any and all help is appreciated thank you for reading!",1700594743.0

What are some tips for becoming rich by travelling and investing in stocks at once?,0,17xvzhu,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/17xvzhu/what_are_some_tips_for_becoming_rich_by/,1,"Hello everyone! Gather around, fellow adventure seekers, because we're about to embark on a quest to blend the joy of travel with the magic of moolah. Imagine becoming rich while hopping from one place to another ‚Äì it's like winning the financial lottery with a side of sunsets and foreign snacks. Here are some simple, yet savvy, tips to turn your globetrotting into a wealth-building extravaganza.  
  
1. Passport to Profits: Ever thought of your passport as a ticket to financial gains? Well, consider it your VIP pass to the world of investments. Investing while abroad is like making money in one currency while spending another ‚Äì it's a financial fiesta! Just watch out for those exchange rates; they can be trickier than finding your way in a new city.  
  
2. Stock Up on Stocks: Instead of just souvenirs, bring back some stocks from your journeys. It's like collecting financial postcards from the places you've been. Picture this: you could own a piece of a company that makes those amazing local snacks you discovered. It's the tastiest form of investment, really!  
  
3. Budget Like a Boss: Traveling doesn't mean throwing your money into a volcano and hoping for good luck. Budgeting is your financial compass. Think of it as planning your route ‚Äì making sure you hit the landmarks without going broke. Financial sightseeing, anyone?  
  
4. Master the Art of FOMO-JOMO: FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) can haunt your travels and investments alike. Swap it for JOMO (Joy of Missing Out). Not every hot stock or trendy travel spot is your cup of tea. Choose the ones that resonate with your taste buds and financial goals. Missing out can be surprisingly joyful!  
  
5. Diversify Your Destinations and Stocks: Just like you wouldn't eat the same dish every day, don't put all your financial eggs in one basket. Diversification is the spice of both travel and investments. Explore different regions and industries ‚Äì it's like having a buffet for your money.

They attempted to make it look like they sent more than what was withdrawn and then ask you to send back via Cash App.  They want you to send a small fee in good faith.

What investing strategy do top-performing hedge funds focus on and why?,1,17xdhau,investing_discussion,https://www.reddit.com/r/investing_discussion/comments/17xdhau/what_investing_strategy_do_topperforming_hedge/,2,"Hey, Financial Explorer! Ready to uncover the secrets of those hedge fund wizards? Grab your magnifying glass ‚Äì we're diving into the thrilling world of investing, with a sprinkle of humor for good measure.  
  
First up, the ""Spread It Like Peanut Butter"" Strategy: Imagine you have a jar of peanut butter, and instead of focusing on just one slice of bread, you spread it across the whole loaf. Hedge funds often do something similar ‚Äì diversification! It's like having a financial buffet; if one dish is having a bad day, you've got a plate full of winners. So, diversify your investments like you diversify your Netflix watchlist ‚Äì don't put all your money on one show!  
  
Now, let's talk about the ""Buy Low, Sell High"" Cha-Cha. Picture this: You walk into a store, and everything's on sale. Do you buy when it's expensive, or do you snag those deals? Hedge funds are like savvy shoppers; they aim to buy investments when they're a bargain and sell when they're strutting their pricey stuff. It's like catching the stock market's Black Friday sales.  
  
And here's a classic move ‚Äì ""Keep Your Cool in a Rollercoaster"" Maneuver. Investing can feel like a theme park ride ‚Äì thrilling, with a few stomach-churning moments. But successful hedge funds stay cool, calm, and collected. It's like being the Zen master of finance. When everyone else is screaming, you're sipping a metaphorical smoothie.  
  
So, Financial Sherlock, whether it's spreading peanut butter, doing the Buy Low, Sell High Cha-Cha, or mastering the Rollercoaster Maneuver, remember: investing is a wild ride, but a bit of diversification and humor can turn it into a financial rollercoaster with a happy ending. Happy investing, and may your portfolio be as diverse as a buffet at a foodie convention! üé¢üí∞

About 4 years ago when I was in my 20‚Äôs I picked what I thought was a good plan of 50% VSGAX and 50% VWENX. My logic was two fold, first I keep reading I should have mostly stocks with maybe 10-20% in bonds when approaching 30 years of age. VWENX offered about 33% allocated to bonds so I felt a third of half my portfolio would hit that target. I also was under the impression if I do one small cap VSGAX and one large cap VWENX that I would be getting aggressive capital growth with the small cap VSGAX.

Years later VSGAX has underperformed and I‚Äôm starting to read that maybe small cap isn‚Äôt the best way to grow my capital over the next 30 years. I keep seeing people say I should have something that tracks the S&P500. In my company‚Äôs plan I do have FXAIX available to me which I‚Äôm thinking of adding into my mix reducing VSGAX to 25% and adding 25% FXAIX or replacing future contributions of VSGAX altogether with FXAIX making it 50% FXAIX and 50% VWENX.

Home to the largest lithium pegmatite mineral resource in the Americas and boasting a maiden mineral resource estimate of 109.2M tonnes at 1.42% lithium oxide, this discovery solidified the region's stature as a key hub for active lithium projects. 

**Furthermore, this positive development augments the potential for the entire district, benefitting Canadian junior Arctic Fox Lithium (AFX.c) which holds three lithium projects located in close proximity to PMET's groundbreaking find.**

As detailed by President & CEO, Harry Chew, AFX successfully wrapped its Phase 1 exploration program at all three of its projects: [https://youtu.be/Xr0ziOpW9EM?si=wxPCrJVC-v\_YU2Sq](https://youtu.be/Xr0ziOpW9EM?si=wxPCrJVC-v_YU2Sq)

The incoming assays are poised to strengthen AFX's position in the industry as, once received, the results will be used to plan for its second phase of exploration on these properties.

AFX's Delta Lake, Kana Lake and Pontax North Projects all have favourable regional geological settings, close proximity to LCT pegmatite occurrences and deposits, and the potential for LCT pegmatites with multiple preliminary targets already outlined.

Demonstrating their immense potential, AFX's Delta Lake and Pontax North Projects are both located in close proximity Allkem (AKE, 8.5B Market Cap) as well as Critical Elements Lithium (CRE, 359.35M Market Cap) Rose Property where excellent lithium grades were returned, identifying several lithium-tantalum pegmatite trends including two kilometre long trends hosting multiple lithium, caesium and tantalum anomalies. 

Most notable, however, is AFX's Kana Lake which, situated the closest to PMET's Corvette Project and CV5 Pegmatite, has over 10 pegmatites including one substantial formation reaching over 500 meters and extending for over 2 kilometres, exhibiting substantial potential for new discoveries and growth.

West Red Lake Gold Mines (WRLG.v WRLGF) Poised for Growth Amid Gold's Bullish Outlook,9,182zr1f,Investments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Investments/comments/182zr1f/west_red_lake_gold_mines_wrlgv_wrlgf_poised_for/,2,">""Although gold remains stuck below $2,000 an ounce, some analysts remain optimistic that all-time highs are an achievable target by year-end or into the new year."" 

Seasonal factors are expected to play a bigger role in the price action of gold, resulting in an extremely bullish outlook as gold continues to shine as a strong hedge against economic uncertainty and a safe haven investment. (Source: [https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-11-23/Gold-prices-below-2-000-but-seasonals-remain-favorable.html](https://www.kitco.com/news/2023-11-23/Gold-prices-below-2-000-but-seasonals-remain-favorable.html)) 

**Boasting a 'first-class acquisition that ""couldn't be created today with less than $700M"" according to billionaire mining investor Frank Giustra, West Red Lake Gold Mines (WRLG.v WRLGF) is one junior gold company with significant potential.**

WRLG's flagship Madsen Mine has a gold resource of 6.9M tons indicated and 1.8M tons inferred in Ontario's Red Lake Gold District, with the latest drill results intersecting 27.15g/t Au over 10.28m and 22.31 g/t Au over 8.5m at its debt-free and fully permitted mine. 

https://preview.redd.it/ba0mg730jc2c1.png?width=1428&format=png&auto=webp&s=3fef3f9628064b3967703a8b06b193fe62dde419

The first round of drill results from the Madsen Mine were drilled from underground on the North Austin Zone, a new area of high-grade mineralization, expanding the resource to the northeast. 

Sitting adjacent to the existing underground development, the zone is a high-caliber target that could potentially be developed early during future mine restart and production as it remains open down-dip and along strike to the northeast and will continue to be a priority expansion target as underground drilling continues.

Believing these intercepts are indicative of the exceptional resource growth potential that still exists at the asset, Shane Williams, WRLG President & CEO, stated:

>""We are very encouraged by this first round of results out from the underground drilling campaign at the Madsen Mine. Our geologic team quickly recognized the exploration potential in the North Austin area, which represents a high-grade expansion target that sits very close to existing underground infrastructure. While a good portion of the underground drill meters will continue to be focused on definition and increasing confidence in the current resource, we will continue to take advantage of near-mine organic growth opportunities that could materially enhance and increase the mineral resource inventory at Madsen.‚Äù 

This news follows WRLG's previous significant step forward in de-risking its high-grade resource following additional positive metallurgical test results from its Rowan Mine Deposit, deeming the Rowan Deposit to be a future source of high-grade, easily recoverable gold ounces that could potentially add a significant boost to the overall production profile at Madsen.

**Notably, Giustra sees the Madsen Mine as a highly attractive and first-class acquisition that ""couldn't be created today with less than $700M.""** 

WRLG's second project in the Gold District is its wholly-owned Rowan Gold Project, located 15 km from the Madsen Mill. With an expansive property position covering 31km squared including three past-producing gold mines, Rowan has a total inferred resource of 2.8M tonnes. 

**Recently, WRLG drilled the highest-grade intercept across the property and successfully intercepted what is believed to be the same high-grade zone approximately 80 meters down-dip.**

The continuation of the mineralization at Rowan bodes well for future expansion opportunities at the company as WRLG continues to extend the highly prospective mineralized vein zone at depth and along strike.

With additional assay results pending, WRLG has significant expansion and discovery potential in the near term as it continues to build high-grade resources in one of the richest gold districts in Canada.

"Opening a ""vast market opportunity to process oilfield brines from any basin across North America"": Volt Lithium (VLT.v VLTLF) Accelerates its Lithium Extraction Strategy",14,17k5g2l,Investments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Investments/comments/17k5g2l/opening_a_vast_market_opportunity_to_process/,0,"**With the successful conduction of its pilot plant operations and commissioning of its permanent Demonstration Plant, capable of testing oilfield brines from multiple basins across North America at one time, Volt Lithium (VLT.v VLTLF) has confirmed its accelerated lithium extraction strategy as detailed in this Streetwise Reports article:** [https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/10/25/canadian-co-confirms-accelerated-lithium-extraction-strategy.html](https://www.streetwisereports.com/article/2023/10/25/canadian-co-confirms-accelerated-lithium-extraction-strategy.html)

In furthering its commitment to achieving commercial lithium extraction from oilfield brines across North America, Volt Lithium (VLT.v VLTLF) has successfully expanded its capabilities beyond its flagship Rainbow Lake Lithium Project.

Building upon the successful pilot plant operations for Rainbow Lake, VLT commissioned its permanent Demonstration Plant which is capable of testing oilfield brines from multiple basins across North America in real-time.

This development enables VLT to use its proprietary Direct Lithium Extraction (DLE) technology to extract lithium regardless of the brine's original lithium concentrations, opening up a vast market opportunity.

Notably, VLT's DLE technology boasts an impressive lithium recovery rate of 90% from concentrations as low as 34 mg/L while maintaining commercial viability. Most notably, however, VLT's tech can achieve  97% recoveries using 120mg/L concentrations.

**Permanent Demonstration Plant** 

The establishment of a Permanent Demonstration Plant represents a critical outcome from VLT's previously announced collaborations with Zend Lab and the Advanced Water Treatment Lab.  

Serving as VLT's cornerstone facility for processing brines, the plant simulates field conditions for extracting lithium from oilfield brines and converting into lithium hydroxide and lithium carbonates. 

This has allowed VLT to successfully remove contaminants from oilfield brine being used for its proprietary DLE technology, a critical step in the DLE process.

**Rainbow Lake & Preliminary Economic Assessment Preparation**

With the reservoir analysis now complete, VLT is finalizing the capital and operating costs required for the establishment of a 20,000-tonne-per-annum lithium plant at Rainbow Lake. 

Showcasing a substantial lithium resource of 4.3 million tonnes with concentrations reaching up to 121mg/L, VLT is aiming to publish the Rainbow Lake PEA before the end of November 2023.

In offering a compelling opportunity to oil and gas operators by providing a win-win situation by adding value to existing oilfield operations, VLT is on track to become a leading player in the DLE sector.

Why do businessmen waste diddy daddlying around with fun stuff when they meet people they want to have a business deal with instead of getting straight to the point? Why spend so much time say playing golf or exploring a museum instead of just negotiating in a private office or meeting room ASAP?,2,16oyxuv,Investments,https://www.reddit.com/r/Investments/comments/16oyxuv/why_do_businessmen_waste_diddy_daddlying_around/,5,"I was reading about how Steve McQueen wanted to do a joint movie project with Oliver Reed who was then the leading man of British cinema and highest paid actor in Europe in terms of raw paycheck. McQueen flew to London and upon meeting Reed, decided to go out with him for a drink at a bar as they discuss the business proposal for the project. As they were chatting and drinking, Reed got so intoxicated by alcohol he vomited on Steve which pissed him off so much that the idea never came through......

Reading this I can't help but wonder if the whole mess would have been avoided if Oliver and Steve just met at an office and went to the point of the deal and we'd now have a big budge film available on DVD and Blu-Ray with both Reeve and McQueen on the front cover below or above the title...... But it does make me curious.......

Oneof the reasons why businessmen have gotten a bad rap today is because so much of the general populace especially the leftist (particularly people from the Millenial generation and younger) often pictures a CEO spending thousands of dollars to fly to Paris or Tokyo or some other fancy district of a major city and then proceeding to play golf with another businessman in a field that costs over $1,000,000 per year to maintain or dine out with said businessman at a 5 star restaurant to have a meal where they drink fancy $100 wine with a bunch of plates each costing over $200 plus $150 bonus small deserts and appetizers. That so many people not involved in business think that all businessmen do is have a great time as they chitter chat with other entrepreneurs while getting a massage at a high end spa or while they're relaxing on a soft cushy sunlounger sipping tea and chatting each others with sunglasses on or their eyes closed. This is in fact one of the primary criticism against Trump, that he spends more time playing golf with other politicians and CEOs when he visits countries for economic and political negotiations than actually getting to the point to focus on real issues.

Now I know business isn't easy at all especially meetings and negotiations because business was my original major but I tossed it out fora different career path. The first time I attended a meeting at a board while in college was so draining! So I'm not a naive socialist who's eager to vote for Bernie Sanders next year.

That said I do see the point of anti-captialists and other disillussioned Americans who grown to have stereotyped business professionals as lazy and corrupt on top of being sheltered.

Why does Bill Gates need to spend a few hours playing tennis with potential business prospects instead of just having a webcam meeting with them ont he computer? Why does Jenniffer Aniston wait until a pool party to meet up with other cleebrities she's interested in as investing partners? Why can't she just drive to their own homes and discuss it possible investments at their dinner table? Is it necessary to spend a whole day drinking beer and playing billiards just to sign a contract? Why do a lot of business owners and investors feel the need to eat at a super expensive restaurant where the cheapest thing on the menu in thriple digits? Why not just save both you and your potential client money by just meeting in an office and get it over with in a 20 minute discussion? Whats the logic behind Trump spending 5 hours playing golf with another billionaire after spending 4 hours traveling in a limousine on the way to that person's house? I mean your purpose for meeting other investors and company owners is for buriness negotiations so why do you have to waste time doing fun stuff with your prospect partners and investors instead of just getting straight to the point selling your stocks within an hour? Really reading about the failed movie proposal that Steve McQueen was considering with Oliver Reed made me so curious!",1695350553.0

I currently invest in the VTSAX fund at Vanguard, but I am unsure if I am contributing too little. I am a litttle nervous about putting too much into it, since the market is so volatile.

Here is my current situation:

(No credit card debt or other major debt)

I invest $500 per month in VTSAX, and there is $6K in it now. (I opened it less than a year ago)

\- I usually put away around $2.5K per month into my savings account

\- I currently have $85K in a normal savings account (at 4% interest)

\- I keep arond $7K in my checking account

Should I dump more into the VTSAX from my savings? Or is $500 per month okay? My goal is just to have a nice amount for retirement.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## Installation and Loading

```{r}
install.packages('tidyverse')
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

THe tidyverse includes a variety amount of packages, such as dplyr for data wrangling, ggplot2 for data visualization, etc. 

## Data Wrangling
We use `dplyr` for data wrangling. We load the package first. To facilitate the illustration, we will use a data set in the `gapminder`. We also load the package.
```{r}
library(dplyr)
install.packages('gapminder')
library(gapminder)
```
Now, let's have a preview of the `gapminder` data set. 
```{r}
gapminder
```
## Filter Data
To filter the data, we can use the `filter` function. In the code below, we filter the table with lines where year is 1957.
```{r}
gapminder %>%
  filter(year == 1957)
```
